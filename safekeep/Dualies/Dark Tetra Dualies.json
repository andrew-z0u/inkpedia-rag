    "The Dark Tetra Dualies are a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3. They are a mid-ranged dualie-type weapon with a few unique properties.",
    "Each pistol has two muzzles and four dodge roll nozzles, which uniquely allows the user to perform up to four dodge rolls in a row. The dodge rolls are somewhat slower than the regular Splat Dualies' and it takes longer to start rolling and moving normally again. This weapon also allows the user to continue shooting while rolling, a property no other dualie has.",
    "Players must land four hits to splat an opponent, doing the same damage as the Dualie Squelchers but having worse accuracy pre-roll. Dodge roll ink consumption is lower than all other dualies', complementing the weapon's ability to roll four times in quick succession. In the post-roll state, the weapon's fire rate and accuracy are improved.",
    "They were revealed on 11 February 2018 at 14:00 UTC[1] and released for Splatoon 2 on 2 March 2018 at 02:00 UTC.[2] For Splatoon 3, they were released at launch on 9 September 2022.",
    "The Dark Tetra Dualies are a set of dualies that seem to be created from plastic derringer pistols with two muzzles, each attached to the sole and pull tab of a basketball shoe. Each consists of two main parts, each in a crescent shape. The main sole-like part of each dualie serves as a front plate, housing two muzzles and four compartments - one for each dodge roll. It has green and purple highlights. The main black part is smaller than the white part and serves as a handle. It has white highlights.",
    "The Dark Tetra Dualies come in a set with Autobombs and Splashdown.",
    "They appear in one Octo Expansion station:",
    "[3]",
    "The Dark Tetra Dualies feature four ink-ejecting nozzles that allow you to execute up to four dodge rolls in a row! Crazy, right?! And because you can shoot while rolling, you'll be able to zip around stages with ease and roll your way to victory. Sniff out sneaky enemies with the Autobomb sub weapon, then zip in with a roll and lay the splat down! With the Splashdown special, this is a set for squidkids who like to get up close and personal!",
    "The Dark Tetra Dualies return in Splatoon 3, appearing identical to the previous game. Their kit has Autobombs and Reefslider.",
    "It appears in one mission in Return of the Mammalians:",
    "[5][6]",
    "The Dark Tetra Dualies feature four ink-ejecting nozzles that allow you to execute up to four Dodge Rolls in a row! Yes, I said FOUR! And because you can shoot while rolling, you'll be able to zip around stages with ease and roll your way to victory. This loadout also comes with Autobombs, which almost seems unfair. You can use those to chase your opponents out of hiding spots, and then swoop in with the splat. And if they slip away? Fire up the Reefslider and hunt 'em down, shark-style. I recommend this set for those who want to set up their own pincer moves and pressure the enemy!",
