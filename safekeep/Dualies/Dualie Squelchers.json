    "The Dualie Squelchers are a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3. They are a re-imagining of the Dual Squelcher from Splatoon; if the player performs a dodge roll, their character will connect their Dualie Squelchers, effectively converting them into the Dual Squelcher. The weapon's accuracy is improved in this post-roll state.",
    "Compared to the Splat Dualies, the Dualie Squelchers have a slightly faster roll and are not locked into place, but suffer from an overall reduced firing rate and no fire rate increase after rolling. They have the second most range of any dualie-type weapon in the game since the release of the Douser Dualies. Shots do enough damage to splat opponents with four hits.",
    "The Dualie Squelchers are nearly identical in appearance to the Dual Squelcher's top and bottom parts. However, the tube that connects the two halves of the Dual Squelcher is exclusive to the right Dualie Squelcher.",
    "The Dualie Squelchers come with Point Sensor and Tenta Missiles. They were released on 29 July 2017 at 02:00 UTC.[1]",
    "It appears in three Octo Expansion stations:",
    "[2]",
    "The Dualie Squelchers are dualie versions of the Jet Squelcher. They feature an exceptional combination of highly accurate rapid fire after rolling, with longish range! You can pinpoint your opponents' positions with the Point Sensor and Tenta Missiles, making you a real nuisance to the enemy team! And you can dodge-roll away from opponents who get close! I recommend them for nimble fighters who want to support their team!",
    "The Dualie Squelchers return in Splatoon 3 with Splat Bombs and Wave Breaker, which is based on the kit that the Dual Squelcher had in Splatoon.",
    "They appear in one mission in Return of the Mammalians:",
    "[3][4]",
    "Do you know the Jet Squelcher? Would you like to have two of them? Good, because that's what Dualie Squelchers offer! If you don't know the Jet Squelcher, it features the ability to fire off extremely accurate and fairly rapid shots after executing a roll. And now you have TWO of them! Meanwhile, you can sniff out enemies with both the Wave Breaker special and your Splat Bombs. I call it the \"see it, splat it\" strategy. If you like to stick and move with accurate shots across a long distance, I recommend you give this loadout a try!",
