    "The Grizzco Dualies are a Salmon Run Next Wave rare weapon in Splatoon 3. They appear to be illegitimately modified[1] Splat Dualies.",
    "The Grizzco Dualies' normal firing mode have a short range and a wide ink spread, while its range and fire rate after performing a dodge roll is comparable to the Splat Dualies. Its dodge rolls are extremely quick, similar to the Dapple Dualies. The dodge rolls also have explosive properties, which deal damage to Salmonids and inks the ground as the player rolls. The player can perform up to nine dodge rolls in a row, which allows the player to quickly splat Lesser Salmonids and move around easily.\nThe explosive properties are able to splat Flyfish with good timing and correct positioning, and it is able to splat a Fish Stick with only one dodge roll if the player is on top of the pillar. It is also possible to instantly ink a Flipper-Flopper's ring by rolling through it.",
    "The Grizzco Dualies resemble the regular Splat Dualies, although they've been heavily modified by Mr. Grizz. The muzzle of each weapon is changed to that of a fireman's hose, complete with a cover dangling below. The main body is stripped of paint, though the metal is still hidden by an added black plastic part connecting each weapon to what appears to be 2 yellow prescription pill bottles with white caps, the contents of which unknown. The position of the bottles is mirrored between the two dualies. A portion of the weapon's trigger guard is replaced by a coiled yellow hose tube attached to a large military green valve located near the bottom of the grip. The smaller ink canisters of the Splat Dualies are replaced with rather large ink tanks painted dark brown and decorated with warning signs and a large Grizzco logo sticker.",
    "The Grizzco Dualies are one of the rare weapons in Salmon Run Next Wave. They were added in version 5.0.0 on 31 August 2023[2], before making their debut on 2 September 2023 at 00:00 UTC during the Big Run on Um'ami Ruins.",

    "- When firing from humanoid form, the first shot takes 3 frames to come out. When firing from swim form, the first shot takes 12 frames to come out.",
    "- The interval between firing the weapon and being able to enter swim form or use a sub weapon is 4 frames.",
    "- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.08 units per frame.",
    "- After firing, there is a 20 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.",
    "- Each shot has a base damage of 35 and minimum damage of 30.",
    "- If a shot is in the air for more than 7 frames after being fired, it will lose about 0.63 damage every frame until it reaches 30 damage at frame 15.",

    "- The weapon starts off having a 1% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle.\nThis chance increases by 1% per shot, and maximizes at a 25% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 24 shots to reach minimum accuracy.",

Shots travel straight for 3.16 distance units.\nAfter that, the shot's velocity is set to 1.58 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.",

After an additional 28 frames, the user will regain their rolls and reenter a normal state if they move or stop firing.\nIn total, this takes 47 frames.",

    "- The Grizzco Dualies causes an explosion when it performs a dodge roll. Targets caught within 4.0 units of the explosion center take 125 damage. Targets caught outside of this radius but inside of the full blast radius of 6.0 units will take between 125 and 40 damage.",
