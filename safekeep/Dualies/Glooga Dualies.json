    "The Glooga Dualies are a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3, manufactured by Deco.",
    "The Glooga Dualies are a dualie-type weapon whose power increases immediately following a dodge-roll. When shooting normally, they splat opponents with three hits. After performing a dodge roll, it only takes two hits to splat an opponent and the shots will travel further. The Glooga Dualies are the only dualies to have increased range or increased damage in the post-roll state.",
    "The Glooga Dualies are blue hot glue guns with a red trigger and a metal rest in front of the nozzle. The dualies each have a main cylinder that houses the nozzle and a hot glue cartridge that changes color to match the user's ink. A pair of rectangular prisms house the trigger, and the back prism serves as a handle.",
    "The Glooga Dualies were released on 2 December 2017 at 02:00 UTC.[1]. They come with Ink Mines and Inkjet.",
    "They appear in one Octo Expansion Station:",

    "The Glooga Dualies were developed with one thing in mind—dishing out a hot deluge of damage! While its rate of fire isn't setting any records, the shots it fires immediately after a dodge roll can really melt the competition! And when you're not sticking it to your foes, the Ink Mine sub weapons can also help allies keep track of your foes. Finally, the Inkjet special makes supporting far-off teammates a snap. This set's got it all!",
    "The Glooga Dualies return in Splatoon 3 with Splash Wall and Booyah Bomb.",
    "They appear in one mission in Return of the Mammalians:",
    "[3][4]",
    "The Glooga Dualies were developed with one thing in mind — pure damage. They're not the fastest dualies, but when you pull off a sweet Dodge Roll with these in your hands, you temporarily gain the ability to fire an outrageously powerful shot! Now, while the big-shot power grabs the headlines, many people overlook the Splash Wall sub. And that's a mistake, because it actually gives you great defensive balance. Last but not least, the Booyah Bomb special has the potential to tip the scales in your favor. I hope this balanced set helps you net a lopsided victory!",
