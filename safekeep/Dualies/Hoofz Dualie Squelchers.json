    "The Hoofz Dualie Squelchers is a main weapon in Splatoon 3, and is the Emberz-branded version of the Dualie Squelchers. It was added as part of the Splatlands Collection on 12 June 2025.",
    "The Hoofz Dualie Squelchers resemble the Dualie Squelchers but with a new color scheme. The insides of the Dualie Squelchers are now a light blue while the outsides have a black and white color pattern similar to a zebra. The right Dualie Squelcher has a ring with six spikes added on the nozzle.",
    "The Hoofz Dualie Squelchers comes with Point Sensor and Splattercolor Screen.",
    "[1][2]",
    "The wild stripes on the Hoofz Dualie Squelchers from Emberz are not unlike the ink stripes you'll be spraying across the battlefield if you choose this loadout! Especially since the inclusion of the Point Sensor sub and Splattercolor Screen special are designed to work in tandem to limit your opponents' ability to submerge. Choose this set if you want to be a leader on the battlefield, creating advantageous situations for your teammates to exploit.",
    "The word hoofz is a stylized spelling of the word hooves, which matches the zebra-print pattern on the weapon bodies thematically.",
