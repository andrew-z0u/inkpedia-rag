    "The Dapple Dualies are a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3, manufactured by Nouveau. It is a dualie with short range but high damage.",
    "Compared to the Splat Dualies, this weapon lets the player perform quicker dodge rolls and inflict more damage, but it has a shorter range and a shorter roll distance to offset its effectiveness in close quarters.",
    "The Dapple Dualies deal enough damage to splat opponents in three hits, unlike the Splat Dualies, Dark Tetra Dualies, Dualie Squelchers and Douser Dualies FF which need to land four hits to splat an enemy. In the post-roll state, the weapon's firing rate is 20% faster than normal, and its accuracy is improved as well.",
    "The Dapple Dualies are built on two main parts, both of which are a berry red color and connected to each other via a black handle. The bottom part of each dualie houses a white and light blue toothbrush, while the top part houses the nozzle, a black pole at the top, and a small metal stick. The upper section looks as if it was build lightweight, for the max mobility. The toothbrush is held in place via a small wire, possibly representing dental floss, that holds it to the stick.",
    "The Dapple Dualies come with Squid Beakons and Suction-Bomb Launcher.",
    "It appears in one Octo Expansion station:",

    "The Dapple Dualies are dualie-type weapons that have been obsessively engineered for optimum mobility! They're now lighter, allowing for faster movement, but they have less range. It's a trade-off. Utilize the increased mobility to set Squid Beakons around the map, and call your teammates to your side! And use the Suction-Bomb Launcher to further expand your team's territory! Recommended for players who want to swiftly splat their opponents and support their team!",
    "The Dapple Dualies return in Splatoon 3 with Squid Beakons and the Tacticooler, looking exactly identical to how they did in the previous game.",
    "They appear in two missions in Return of the Mammalians:",
    "[3][4]",
    "The Dapple Dualies are dualie-type weapons that have been obsessively engineered for optimum mobility! They're now lighter, allowing for faster movement, but they have less range. It's a trade-off. But you know what goes well with mobility? Even more mobility! That's where the Tacticooler special shines. Blitz forward with added speed from the Tacticooler, and place Squid Beakons to help your teammates secure forward positions to take advantage of this set. It's not a hit-and-run strategy. It's more like... run-hit-run-run-hit-hit-hit-run... You get the picture.",
