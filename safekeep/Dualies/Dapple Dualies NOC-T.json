    "The Dapple Dualies NOC-T is a main weapon in the Splatoon series. It is a Barazushi-branded variant of the Dapple Dualies.",
    "The Dapple Dualies NOC-T have a similar design to the original Dapple Dualies. However, small black flashlights with yellow lenses have been put on the front of each dualie. Each Flashlight has a small Barazushi sticker on the side. In regards to color palette, the Dapple Dualies NOC-T have a brown and grey base with some white details along the top half. The back part (which is a toothbrush) is mostly orange with several grey accents and small yellow details. A thin white string connects the tip of the toothbrush to a section of the main dualie.",
    "The Dapple Dualies NOC-T makes its first appearance in Splatoon 3 as part of the Splatlands Collection. Its kit is Splat Bomb and Killer Wail 5.1.",
    "[1][2]",
    "It's a shame that Dapple Dualies users move so fastâ€“the other team will barely get an eyeball on the updated design of the Dapple Dualies NOC-T from Barazushi!  Especially because said player will be peppering the other team with Splat Bombs and Dodge Rolling to get in position to set up the Killer Wail 5.1 for those pesky distant foes. I'd recommend this set for anyone who can see the big picture and wants the ability to manage micro-battles both near and far.",
    "The suffix \"NOC-T\" is a stylized spelling of the word nocturnal, an organism that is mostly active during night, thematically matching the night vision scopes attached to the weapon.",
