    "The Hero Dualies have a design very similar to the Splat Dualies. Like all Hero weapons, they have a black and lime-green color scheme with highlights that change color depending on the upgrades. The nozzles and handles are yellow, and the rest of the dualies are black except for the highlights that change color depending on the upgrades.",

    "The Hero Dualies can be upgraded one level. Like all Hero weapons of Splatoon 2, they come with switchable sub weapons of Splat Bombs, Curling Bombs and Autobombs. They are loaned by Sheldon during the level, The Octopark, and can be used in missions after beating the level. Beating all missions in Octo Canyon with the dualies will unlock the Hero Dualie Replicas for purchase at Ammo Knights.",

Despite their unique appearance, they are simply a reskin of the Splat Dualies, sharing the same stats and loadout, Burst Bombs and Tenta Missiles.",
