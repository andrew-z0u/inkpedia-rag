    "The Angle Shooter is a sub weapon in Splatoon 3. It travels quickly in a straight line, bouncing off of any surface it touches. It can damage and/or mark enemies.",
    "The Angle Shooter resembles a highlight marker. The label wrapped around the Angle Shooter features the Nouveau logo and other  Inkling text. Like Point Sensor, enemies tagged by the Angle Shooter are encircled by a translucent black arrow and tied to members of the user's team with a line of the user's ink color, although each line is only visible to the member it leads to.",
    "The following Return of the Mammalians level serves as a tutorial for the Angle Shooter:",
    "The Angle Shooter is a fast-moving projectile that travels in a straight line and bounces off any surface except grating, leaving behind a large puddle of ink on each bounce, until it reaches its maximum travel distance or hits an enemy. The projectile briefly leaves behind a team-colored trail. Enemies directly hit by the Angle Shooter are damaged, and those that are hit or touch its lingering trail are marked.",
    "The projectile is aimed and fired at a lower angle than the usual crosshair, making it somewhat unintuitive to aim directly, especially from below.",
    "When bouncing off of horizontal surfaces such as floors, the projectile's exit angle is much shallower than its entry angle - the projectile stays close to the floor for longer. This makes the projectile more likely to connect with an enemy following a bounce off the floor, and allows much more freedom with aiming from high up.",
    "Imagine bouncing an Angle Shooter off the walls of a narrow corridor, pinning down a rival. If they touch the line, they take damage... so while they hesitate, you pounce with your heavy main weapon and ink 'em up good! Take that, Gary! I mean... if your rival's name is Gary.",

    "The Angle Shooter's English name comes from the term \"angle shooting\", which describes behavior in gambling games that is not technically cheating, but considered unethical.",
