    "Introduction",
    "As far as I can tell, most educational guide content for Splatoon falls under one of three categories: tips and tricks, tier lists, and in some cases, discussions of specific topics (such as weapons, maps, modes, etc.). However, I haven’t felt like I’ve found any satisfying guide or series of guides that builds a narrative that can take you from knowing very little about the game beyond play experience all the way to a high-level competitive understanding of how to win. The first goal of this doc series is to fix that: to start with very little assumptions about what you know about this game, and put you on a path to growing and getting better as a player.",
    "With that said, I think you’ll find that this doc series is very different than much of the other guide content you’ve seen before. Very rarely in this doc series will I give specific advice about what to do in specific situations or with your specific weapon, and that’s for two reasons. Firstly, you can get plenty of that in other places. Secondly, that’s simply not the point of this resource, because I think most people are not equipped to use that kind of advice responsibly.",
    "What I mean by that is this: Splatoon is a complicated game. There’s 4 people on each team, tons of different weapons and maps, and all kinds of crazy situations you can get yourself into. The reality is that no single useful piece of advice that anyone gives is going to apply in every situation. Even in this very document, I will very frequently make simplifying assumptions. What this means is thatif you truly want to get better, you HAVE to be able to think for yourself— to think critically about the advice people give you, and the ideas you come up with, and to meaningfully learn from your own experiences and observations. Without that fundamental skill, I’ve unfortunately watched Splatoon advice — both from me and others — get misinterpreted and misused time and time again.",
    "Instead, the second and ultimate goal of this doc series is to give you a real, concrete framework to be able to think critically and learn how this game works for yourself. Whether you’re a relatively new player interested in getting to or climbing higher in X rank, or someone who’s played competitive at a high level for a long time, I hope you’ll find it useful, or at the very least, I hope it’ll put into words some things that you’ve experienced but haven’t been able to explain well.",
    "zyf note: Also, my DMs on both Twitter and Discord are open (see below in credits for links) — please feel free to provide any feedback or ask any clarifying questions!",
    "An Overview and Lesson Plan",
    "What Does It Mean to Play Smart?",
    "The ultimate goal of this doc series is to give anyone with a baseline-level competency at playing this game (~S rank is probably a good baseline) the tools tolearn, on their own,how to “play smart.”",
    "You might ask — what does that even mean?",
    "I think the level at which this is most misunderstood is at thetacticallevel. To give a sense of what I mean by “tactical,” I’d like to frame the discussion as follows:",
    "At any given time, during a match, a thinking player intentionally makes decisions in response to their current situation. From now on, I’ll refer to the “current situation” as thestate of the game, and a “decision” is essentially encapsulated by theactionthe player (you) decides to take.",
    "A “good” action is just one that has a high probability of leading the game into a state that brings you closer to winning, or at least, further from losing.",
    "Thus, tactical decision-making sits at a level above what you’re thinking about at a split-second level, but below the level of things like gear and weapon/composition choices. It’s short-term goal-setting that helps you flow through the match and make individual plays.",
    "Before we begin, notice that my goal is not, fundamentally, to tell you what the correct way to play is. I don’t really know that. I can only describe the PROCESS by which you learn to playmorecorrectly than before, which I do think I have a good handle on.",
    "The Three Pillars",
    "With that ultimate goal in mind, in my mind, there’s really three main Pillars that are needed to understand how you learn to think more effectively during a match.",
    "The first fundamental question to answer is: \"how do I make sense of the state of the game, and what can I do to affect it?\"",
    "As anyone who’s started out playing this game knows, it’s quite overwhelming to just keep track of everything when you first start playing, and while you may have a better sense of it now, the truth of the matter is, even now you're probably still a little bit lost in the middle of matches. I get lost sometimes too, although I usually have a pretty good handle on what is happening.",
    "Either way, the first thing that needs to happen is that you fundamentally understand what’s going on in a match of Splatoon and can organize the stuff going on in a meaningful way. The purpose of this first Pillar is to build a “vocabulary” of:",
    "(a) what the state of the game is, and",
    "(b) what the actions that you can take are.",
    "Once you have the language and concepts to understand the game at a basic level, the next step is trying to figure out how to marry the two things together (states and actions) and answer the question: \"how do I now make sense of choosing what to do?\" This is, in essence, driven by your model of how the game works. Another way of describing this idea is how you conceptualize what the “rules” are that tell you what will and won’t go well, and why the rules are the way they are. Then, armed with that knowledge, you go into a game with simplifying assumptions or gut intuitions/ reactions to what is good and bad in a particular situation, and then you act according to them.",
    "The problem, of course, is sometimes the rules you come up with or are told to follow (by random posts on Twitter [like mine], or a coach, or YouTube) don’t actually lead you to winning more. This leads us to the last Pillar, dealing with the question of “how do I learn?”",
    "This is, as far as I can tell, a continual process — I don’t think anyone has all the answers to everything in this game.",
    "The short answer to this question is embedded in what I’ve already said — you need a feedback loop, and the ability to sense when what you’re doing isn’t actually helping you win, but we’ll get into that in more detail later.",
    "The Practical Reality of Applying The Pillars",
    "As we all know, Splatoon can move pretty fast — stuff is constantly happening, and the situation is constantly changing. Rarely, if ever, will you have time to actually sit down and calculate out, \"hmm, this is the current state of the game, so let me go through my model of what will happen if I do these different things and decide which one I should do.\" That just… doesn’t happen lol. The vast majority of the time, you are playing very heavily on instinct.",
    "Honestly, the only critical difference between thoughtless instinct and \"thinking\" instinct is the sense that you are consciously registering the current (overall) state of the game and then reacting/responding in accordance with it, rather than just kind of following whatever is in front of you. The process of actually getting better, in a tactical sense, is essentially just a process of overwriting bad habits with good habits, and possibly introducing more good habits where they weren't before. A lot of the thinking kind of has to be done not during a match. As for all the details of how that comes about, those discussions will come later. For now, we’ll need to start with the fundamentals of Pillar 1.",
    "The rest of this document serves as a table of contents for the topics I want to discuss; they are meant to be read in the order presented, and I will freely assume concepts from previous sections/pages carry over to future ones, although you are free to read them in any order.",
    "What’s coming soon",
    "Keep an eye out for future updates where zyf’s doc series continues! To follow will be a six-part in-depth breakdown including Pillar 1 (conceptual foundations), Pillar 2 (modeling decision-making), and Pillar 3 (learning from experience). These parts will expand further on the concepts zyf talked about before, and they are going to help you to improve your critical thinking and have better decision-making with the game and how you approach it.",
    "If you want to see what is coming next, we are going to leave you with a small “sneak peek”:",
    "Conceptual Foundations (Pillar 1)",
    "In this first set of topics, we build up a vocabulary for understanding why matches flow the way they do and how the things we do influence that flow.",
    "Modeling Decision-Making (Pillar 2)",
    "In this second section, we put together the concepts we’ve learned to help us internalize and interpret the flow of the match during actual games, and we discuss how to make intentional decisions to explicitly influence matches to flow in particular directions to our favour.",
    "Learning From Experience (Pillar 3)",
    "For this last section, we put in practice what we learned by doing some experimentation, how you yourself can approach doing a vod review of your own games and how you can start working on changing and adding habits to your gameplay.",
