    "The Grizzco Splatana is a Salmon Run Next Wave rare weapon in Splatoon 3. It appears to be an illegitimately modified[1] Splatana Stamper.",
    "The weapon is a short-ranged splatana that does not send out ink \"beams\" and only covers a small area of ground in front of the user, limiting its use to melee combat. It is an extremely powerful weapon, however; the uncharged attack deals 200 damage and can be used to repeatedly hit a wide swath in front of the user. The charged swing takes around 2.5 seconds to fully power up, but is devastatingly strong, dealing 1200 damage while piercing armor like the Grizzco Slosher, making it capable of destroying almost any Boss Salmonid in one hit, regardless of whether or not they are in a normally vulnerable state; the slash is also able to destroy Maws that are still submerged. Like other splatana weapons, using the charged attack while moving forward causes the user to fly forward before swinging, and the Grizzco Splatana's lunge covers a considerable distance, so caution is advised when using it around ledges and enemies.",
    "The Grizzco Splatana takes on the appearance of the Splatana Stamper. However, it has been modified to give it superior power, in exchange for the removal of its projectile-launching ability. In terms of aesthetic additions, the weapon features metal armatures along the blade and on the handle, as well as turnstiles on the center of the weapon, which resemble large engines, with what look like copper wires wound around small cylinders. There is orange tape all over the weapon. Finally, the grip is brown with the Grizzco logo in white, two yellow pill bottles with white caps, and a taped yellow underside.",
