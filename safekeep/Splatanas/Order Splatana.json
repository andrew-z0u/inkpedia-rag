    "The Order Splatana is a splatana in Splatoon 3 that is exclusively used in Side Order.",
    "The Order Splatana has a minimalist appearance, with a white molded chain and base for the body of the weapon, as well as a metallic silver handle at the bottom. Its appearance is similar to that of a Splatana Stamper. When used, ring-shaped holograms manifest around the lower base of the of the Splatana.",
    "The Order Splatana is a weapon unlocked in Side Order, and is part of Frye's Palette. Its base set consists of Fizzy Bombs and Crab Tank. However, this can be changed in the Spire of Order by using a vending machine.",
    "It has lower stats in comparison to the Splatana Stamper, with a slower swing rate, strafe speed, ink efficiency, ink coverage, range, and charge time, but has higher projectile damage. However, this can be upgraded through color chips in the Spire of Order.",
