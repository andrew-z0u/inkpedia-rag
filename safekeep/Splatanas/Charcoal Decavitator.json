    "The Charcoal Decavitator is a main weapon in Splatoon 3. It is a Neo-branded variant of the Mint Decavitator.",
    "The Charcoal Decavitator appears broadly similar to its base weapon, the Mint Decavitator, but with coloration differences. Most of the white and blue elements of the base weapon are now an extremely dark navy and gold, respectively. Additionally, the bristles of the toothbrush alternate purple and yellow, and the pull trigger and lower trim of the handle are gold instead of gray. The clear plastic of the sheath is also dark-tinted, and the wordmark has different colors.",
    "The Charcoal Decavitator was announced as part of Sizzle Season 2024 and was released on 1 June 2024. Its kit is Splash Wall and Inkjet.",
    "[1][2]",
    "The Charcoal Decavitator has the same specs as the Mint Decavitator but a different flavor profile to change things up! Gatekeep your enemies with the Splash Wall sub weapon so you can lie in wait for your enemies to come within range of your charge attack! And if your foes are too smart for that, there's no outwitting a well-executed Inkjet assault! Put your enemies in their place, and keep them there forever! I'd highly suggest this for anyone looking to take to the front lines and wipe the smiles off their enemies' faces!",
    "These two Decavitators have distinctive flavors so choose the one that fits your taste!",
    "Charcoal is a reference to charcoal toothpaste which contains activated charcoal. Decavitator comes from \"de-\" + \"cavity\", as toothbrushes are used to prevent tooth cavities. It is also a play on decapitation, or the act of separating the head and body (for example, with a sword).",
