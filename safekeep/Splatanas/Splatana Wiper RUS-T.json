    "The Splatana Wiper RUS-T is a main weapon in the Splatoon series. It is a Barazushi-branded variant of the the Splatana Wiper from the Splatlands Collection and features a different sub and special weapon.",
    "The Splatana Wiper RUS-T is similar to the appearance of the Splatana Wiper, albeit with its handle and frame painted brown to resemble a rusty \"finish\". The handle has a packet resembling a field ration packet stamped with Barazushi's logo attached to it. The frame has white painted text whose meaning is unknown. Traces of oxidized green paint are visible on various parts of the weapon.",
    "The Splatana Wiper RUS-T was revealed on the Splatlands Collection update trailer, for the 10.0.0 version of the game. Its set is Curling Bomb and Trizooka.",
    "[1][2]",
    "Don't let its looks fool you - the Splatana Wiper RUS-T isn't old or rusty. It's just painted to look that way by Barazushi! Underestimate this weapon at your own risk, especially paired with Curling Bombs that allow the user to quickly advance before taking out foes with a charged slash. And for those just out of range? Let the Trizooka special be your great equalizer. This set really lets the Splatana Wiper shine, despite its appearance. Swing away!",
    "The brand stylization suffix \"RUS-T\" is derived from rust (or rusty, if the letter T is pronounced separately as its hyphenation could suggest), referring to the weapon's ostensibly rusted appearance.",
