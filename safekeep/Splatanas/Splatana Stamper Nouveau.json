    "The Splatana Stamper Nouveau, formerly known as the Neo Splatana Stamper,[note 1] is a main weapon in Splatoon 3. It is the Nouveau-branded version of the Splatana Stamper, with identical stats.",
    "The Splatana Stamper Nouveau is similar to the appearance of the Splatana Stamper, except the base, which is white with a green strip along the handle. The date-wheel is also green, and the metal chassis has a sticker bearing the Nouveau logo.",
    "The Splatana Stamper Nouveau was first revealed in the Chill Season 2023 announcement trailer on 15 November 2023, and was released on 1 December 2023 as part of the new season's content. Its kit consists of Toxic Mist and Crab Tank.",
    "[1][2]",
    "The Splatana Stamper Nouveau offers the same performance as the Splatana Stamper but with a new look and a whole new play style! Don't believe me? Imagine you're caught in some Toxic Mist, and the other team comes in and splats you instantly with a charged slash. Only that's what YOU can do to THEM! Not to mention the Crab Tank special, which is a total game changer. Now you've got the splatana for up-close-and-personal fighting and the Crab Tank to strike from afar. Formidable! If you like splatanas but wish you had a longer range, give this set a try! Once you master the sub and special, this set can be really... special. It's so nice I said it twice!",
