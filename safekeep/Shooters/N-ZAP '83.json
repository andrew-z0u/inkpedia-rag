    "The N-ZAP '83 is a main weapon in Splatoon and Splatoon 2. It is a Sheldon's Picks-branded variant of the N-ZAP '85 and comes with a different sub and special. It has a similar color scheme to the Famicom, an early version of the NES which was released in 1983 only in Japan, hence its name.",
    "The N-ZAP '83 shares its overall design with the N-ZAP '85. However, its barrel and handhold are maroon instead of gray, the body is a dark wheat color instead of white, and the trigger is black instead of red. The side of the handhold features additional buttons derived from the Famicom's standard controller.",
    "The N-ZAP '83 was released on 8 June 2016, as part of Sheldon's Picks volume 2. It comes with the sub Point Sensor and the special Kraken.",

    "The N-ZAP '83 is an N-ZAP '85 that I've modified to faithfully recreate a classic limited-edition piece. It's so faithful, in fact, that the buttons might stick a bit sometimes... But that's all part of the charm, yes? The Point Sensor and Kraken make for a set that is handy for cutting off your opponents' advance.(NA)",

    "The N-ZAP '83 is a replica of a weapon shrouded in legend. The original was only produced for a short time, but I brought it back! Support the main weapon with the fire-and-forget Sprinkler sub, and bring on the rain delays with the Ink Storm special! If you value aggressive inking and want to take a trip down memory lane, this set's for you!",
