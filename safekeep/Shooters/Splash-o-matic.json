    "The Splash-o-matic is a main weapon in the Splatoon series, made by the weapon brand Neo.",
    "It is a short-range, high-accuracy shooter with a fire rate equal to that of the Splattershot Jr.",
    "The Splash-o-matic, similarly to its cousin the Sploosh-o-matic, seems to be a marker or pen inside a metal frame. The marker changes color to match the user's ink. The Splash-o-matic has what appears to be a pressure sensor near the nozzle, and flanking the nozzle is a pair of levers with black handles. On the back of the Splash-o-matic is a small black attachment that supports a lever. The rings on the attachment and the lever also change color to match the user's ink. Attached to the marker are the handle and trigger.",
    "The Splash-o-matic was released in Splatoon on 13 June 2015 at 02:00 UTC.[1]",
    "[2]",
    "For your main weapon, I present the Splash-o-matic, a weapon fine-tuned for highly accurate barrages! It's a little lacking in power, but it can ink the ground rapidly, letting you quickly fill up your special gauge. Then with the Bomb Rush special weapon, you can toss Suction Bombs to your heart's content! Fun, yes?(NA)",
    "For your Main weapon, I present the Splash-o-matic, a weapon specialised for highly accurate barrages! It's a little lacking in power, but it can paint the ground rapidly, letting you quickly fill up your Special Gauge... Then with the Bomb Rush Special weapon, you can rain down Suction Bombs upon your foes! Fun, yes?(EU/OC)",
    "The Splash-o-matic returns in Splatoon 2 looking identical to how it did in the first game. It comes with Toxic Mist and Inkjet.",
    "It appears in one Octo Expansion station:",
    "[3][4]",
    "For your main weapon, I present the Splash-o-matic, a weapon fine-tuned for highly accurate barrages! It's a little lacking in power, but it provides pretty good cover with its rapid fire. You can limit your opponent's movements with Toxic Mist, and then complete the domination with the Inkjet special! I recommend this for aggressive players who want to lay the smackdown on their opponents!",
    "The Splash-o-matic returned in Splatoon 3 with identical stats.",
    "Its design was changed in the update preceding the release of Fresh Season 2023, with the formerly silver parts of the design now being black. This is reflected in the in-game artwork, as well.",
    "It appears in one mission in Return of the Mammalians:",
    "[5]",
    "For your main weapon, I present the Splash-o-matic, a weapon fine-tuned for highly accurate barrages! It may not have the ink spread or raw power of some weapons, but it more than makes up for it with rapid fire that is quite rapid indeed. Plus, when you can pin down an enemy with Burst Bombs, you don't need as much power. Simply splatter them at your leisure while they're mired in your ink. And with the Crab Tank special your back pocket, nothing can stand in your way! Try not to laugh maniacally as you overpower the other team time and again.",
    "For competitive tips about the Splash-o-matic",
    "Splash-o-matic is derived from Splash and Automatic. The -o-matic suffix is also a common, cliché naming convention for technological gadgets.",
    "シャープマーカー Shāpu mākā (\"Sharp Marker\") references the pen-based appearance of the Splash-o-matic. The name is also to contrast it with the Sploosh-o-matic. The highly accurate Splash-o-matic is named after a sharp marker pen, while the Sploosh-o-matic with its wide, cone-shaped muzzle is more akin to a bold marker pen.",
