    "The Blaster is a main weapon in the Splatoon series, created by Custom. As its name suggests, it is a \"blaster\", a type of weapon that fires ink rounds that explode shortly after.",
    "When pressing , the weapon shoots special ink rounds that burst like fireworks after traveling a certain distance. These bursts can deal damage in a wide area, allowing its user to attack opponents hiding behind obstacles and around corners. The explosive round does enough damage to splat opponents with only one direct hit or two indirect hits. Its fire rate is faster than that of the Range Blaster, and slower than that of the Luna Blaster.",
    "The Blaster's appearance is based on the idea of a \"hot rod\", or custom, car. The rear of the weapon is a spray can, the kind of spray can that would be used to custom-paint a car. The middle of the weapon exposes the internals of the weapon as if to make it easier for the owner to tweak and maintain any custom parts inside. The exposed spring resembles the coil springs in car suspensions. The front of the weapon features a flame design characteristic of custom-painted cars, which is painted on an object that resembles a muffler.",
    "As of Splatoon 3, the front of the weapon also features a handle, resembling ones seen on paint cans. Plus, the weapon has new animations: a lever on the left that pulls downwards, as well as the spring located in the center of the weapon that \"throws\" the front part of the weapon forward. These two animations occur with every shot.",
    "The Blaster comes in a set with the Disruptors and Killer Wail. The weapon consumes 8% of the ink tank's capacity with each shot, and the ink tank refills 1.67% of its capacity between each shot, allowing for 15 shots to be fired before needing to refill on ink.",
    "[1]",
    "The Blaster fires ink shots that explode a short while after they've been shot. It's specialised in offense!\nRapid fire and range aren't its strong points, but the powerful shots can damage anyone within their blast!\nUse the included Disruptors to disable your foes before you take them down. Great for coolheaded fighters!(NA)",

Great for cool-headed fighters!(EU/OC)",
    "The Blaster returns in Splatoon 2 with the same appearance and slightly changed performance. It comes with Toxic Mist and Splashdown. The weapon consumes 10% of the ink tank's capacity with each shot, allowing for 10 shots to be fired before needing to refill ink.",
    "It appears in six Octo Expansion stations:",
    "[3][4]",
    "The Blaster main in this set is a relative of the shooter family, but it fires balls of ink that explode in midair! It's a bit lacking in the range and fire-rate departments, but when it hits...it HITS. Even near misses deal damage thanks to the ink explosion! Pin the enemy down with the Toxic Mist sub, then hit 'em like BLAM! If they escape the mist, drop the hammer on 'em with Splashdown! This high-octane set is perfect for battlers who like to bring it on!",
    "The Blaster returns in Splatoon 3 with a slightly updated design. It has Autobombs and the Big Bubbler as its kit.",
    "It appears in one mission in Return of the Mammalians:",
    "[5]",
    "What can I say about the Blaster other than... it blasts. HARD. When those balls of ink explode, they can even tag enemies hiding behind walls. Now, the range isn't great, and the rate of fire leaves a little to be desired, but you can always coax an enemy out of hiding with an Autobomb, can't you? On the other hand, if you're getting charged, that's when it's time to break out the Big Bubbler. Basically, if YOU want to be the one controlling the action, this is the loadout for you.",
    "For competitive tips about the Blaster",
    "The Blaster appears as Inkling's up smash attack in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, alongside a variety of other weapons that Inkling uses in their attacks.",
    "When attacking, Inkling charges up their attack and fires the Blaster upwards to deal damage to opponents above them. This attack has a large radius, much like the blaster in the Splatoon franchise, and can sometimes deal damage to opponents around Inkling if they're close enough. This also coats opponents in ink, as do most of Inkling's attacks, but does not ink the ground. It deals much lower damage if Inkling is out of ink.",
