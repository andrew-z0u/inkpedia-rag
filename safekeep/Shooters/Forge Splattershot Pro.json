    "The Forge Splattershot Pro is a main weapon in the Splatoon series. It is a Forge-branded variant of the Splattershot Pro.",
    "The Forge Splattershot Pro shares its overall design with the Splattershot Pro. However, the Forge Splattershot Pro's trigger piece, pyramid, and nozzle tip are white, and the tube, handhold, and the piece next to the pyramid are black. The nozzle is orange and bears the Forge logo. The trigger is also orange.",
    "Nearly identical to the Splattershot Pro, the Forge Splattershot Pro is an advanced weapon in terms of power and fire rate, making it easy to use for more experienced players. It comes in a set with the Point Sensor and Inkzooka.",
    "[1]",
    "What do you get when you cross a pro weapon with top gear brand Forge? It's the Forge Splattershot Pro!\nIts stats haven't changed, but the Point Sensor and Inkzooka open up new tactical potential!\nLike the Splattershot Pro, it's not the easiest weapon to handle, so try it out if you've got what it takes!",
    "The Forge Splattershot Pro was released on 2 September 2017 at 02:00 UTC.[2]",
    "The Forge Splattershot Pro makes use of the same main weapon as Splattershot Pro: it is a long-range, high damage shooter with high ink consumption. It comes with the Suction Bomb and Bubble Blower.",
    "[3][4]",
    "The Forge Splattershot Pro is a custom Splattershot Pro weapon set put together by the gear brand Forge! The main weapon functions identically to the Splattershot Pro, but you can keep opponents at arm's length with Suction Bombs! And the Bubble Blower special is the perfect complement to the main weapon's long range! It's not the easiest set to use, but if you master it, you'll be unstoppable!",
    "The Forge Splattershot Pro returns in Splatoon 3 with Suction Bombs and the Booyah Bomb in its kit. It was released as part of Chill Season 2022 on 1 December 2022.",
    "[5]",
    "If the Splattershot Pro is for pro Splattershot users, I guess the Forge Splattershot Pro is for pro Splattershot users who also rock Forge-brand gear! It's a mouthful, but when this set is firing on all cylinders, it does the talking for you. The main weapon is functionally identical to the base Splattershot Pro, but a Suction Bomb a day keeps the enemies away! Or, well, as many Suction Bombs as you can muster. And while the Booyah Bomb special might feel like too many bombs, when you get a chance to drop one, you'll realize that there's no such thing as too many bombs! This set isn't necessarily balanced for a beginner, but if you can handle it, few opponents will be able to handle YOU!",
    "For competitive tips about the Forge Splattershot Pro",
    "Forge Splattershot Pro is a combination of Splatter (as well as Splat), Shot and the shortened form of Professional. It has the Forge brand name as a prefix to differentiate it from the Splattershot Pro. It also denotes that the weapon is a collaboration with Forge.",
    "Its Japanese name, プライムシューターコラボ puraimu shūtā korabo, means \"Prime Shooter Collab\". The abbreviated suffix Collab denotes it is a collaboration. However, unlike the English name, it doesn't specify the brand Forge.",
