    "The Order Shot is a shooter in Splatoon 3 that is exclusively used in Side Order.",
    "The Order Shot has a minimalist appearance, with a white molded piece for the barrel, ink tank, and handle of the weapon, as well as a metallic silver end cap and nozzle. Its appearance is similar to that of a Splattershot. When firing, ring-shaped holograms manifest around the nozzle of the Shooter.",
    "The Order Shot is a weapon unlocked in Side Order, and is part of Agent 4's Palette. Its base set consists of Splat Bombs and Trizooka. However, this can be changed in the Spire of Order by using a vending machine.",
    "It has lower stats in comparison to the Splattershot, with a slower fire rate, damage, strafe speed, ink efficiency, and range. However, this can be upgraded through color chips in the Spire of Order.",
