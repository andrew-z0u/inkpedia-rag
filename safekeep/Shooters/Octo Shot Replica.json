    "The Octo Shot Replica, known in Splatoon as the Octoshot Replica, is a main weapon in the Splatoon series. It is functionally identical to the Tentatek Splattershot in each game it appears in.",
    "The Octo Shot Replica bears resemblance to the original design of the Splattershot, albeit with the aesthetics of a firearm instead of a toy. The main parts of the gun are a black body with a pistol grip and trigger, a foregrip attached to the barrel, and an ink tank which changes color to match the user's ink. The ink tank is connected to the body via an elongated metal tube at the back (which sticks out much further than the Splattershot's rear tube) and a black strip wrapping around the top of the tank, attaching it to the body. On the end of the body is a gray metal nozzle.",
    "The Octoshot Replica was released with the 2.0.0 update on 6 August 2015 at 02:00 UTC. The Octoshot Replica is based on the Octoshots used by Octolings, looking like a sleeker, more metallic version of the Splattershot.",
    "It cannot be purchased, instead being obtained as a reward from Judd for reaching Level 40. The Octoshot Replica's stats, sub weapon, and special weapon are identical to those of the Tentatek Splattershot. It generally has middling stats with no particular strengths or weaknesses. It comes with Suction Bombs and the Inkzooka. It was introduced in version 2.0.0 with the addition of Judd's rewards.",

    "The Octo Shot Replica comes with Splat Bombs and Inkjet. The Octo Shot Replica's stats, sub weapon, and special weapon are identical to those of the Tentatek Splattershot. It was released in version 3.1.0 with the release of the Octo Expansion, being unlocked after the player completes its main story.",
    "[2][3]",
    "The Octo Shot Replica comes with Splat Bombs and Triple Inkstrike. The Octo Shot Replica's stats, sub weapon, and special weapon are identical to those of the Tentatek Splattershot. It was released in version 7.0.0 with the release of Side Order, being unlocked after the player completes the tower using Eight's Palette.",
