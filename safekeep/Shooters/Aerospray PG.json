    "The Aerospray PG is a main weapon in Splatoon and Splatoon 2. The Aerospray PG fires quick bursts, so its user can cover a relatively large area with ink in a short time. It is also a short-range weapon, so it makes quick work of nearby targets.",
    "The Aerospray PG shares its overall design with the Aerospray MG. However, the Aerospray PG is almost entirely bronze. The nozzle and attachments supporting the tube are a dull metal color, and the Ammo Knights logo on the tank is white. The black tube at the back of the Aerospray PG appears to be shinier than the one on the other Aerosprays.",
    "The Aerospray PG is one of the nine weapons included in Sheldon's Picks Vol. 2 and was released on 8 June 2016. It is in a set with the Burst Bombs and the Kraken. Like the Aerospray MG and RG, the PG can only be purchased after defeating The Rampaging Octowhirl! boss battle and obtaining its Sunken Scroll.",

    "The Aerospray PG is a little update to the Aerospray MG that I built from my grandpappy's blueprints. It's a hand-crafted work of art, if I do say so myself. I really put a lot of love into it! The Burst Bombs let you control your opponents' movements before smashing them with the Kraken. Rated PG for severe splattings!",
    "The Aerospray PG was released on 3 April 2019 at 01:00 UTC as part of version 4.6.0.[3] It comes with Burst Bombs and the Booyah Bomb.",
    "[4][5]",
    "The Aerospray PG has been designed by and for masters of the art of splatting, and has been optimized and refined in every way imaginable! Keep your foes at tentacle's length with a barrage of Burst Bombs, all while inking a solid swath on your path to victory! And when the going gets tough, break out the Booyah Bomb to turn the tide of battle in your favor! For some, the key to victory is simple: just cover everything in ink. If this describes you, give this set a go!",
    "For competitive tips about the Aerospray PG",
    "The PG in this weapon's name likely stands for \"Perfect Grade\", referencing Bandai's line of 1:60 scale model kits for the anime Mobile Suit Gundam. This is because it is common for model kits to be painted with an airbrush and because Gundam models are extremely popular in Japan.",
    "In Sheldon's quote for the weapon in the North American and European/Oceania versions of Splatoon; \"Rated PG for severe splattings!\", is a reference to the same age rating the MPAA uses for theater films.",
