    "- The matchmaking range is 12.5. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.",
    "- The ink consumption is 0.92% per shot, allowing the user to fire for about 10.87 seconds on a full ink tank.",
    "- When firing continuously, it shoots a bullet every 6 frames (10 shots per second).",
    "- When firing from humanoid form, the first shot takes 3 frames to come out. When firing from swim form, the first shot takes 11 frames to come out.",
    "- The interval between firing the weapon and being able to enter swim form or use a sub weapon is 4 frames.",
    "- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.072 units per frame.",
    "- After firing, there is a 20 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.",
    "- Each shot has a base damage of 36 and minimum damage of 18.",
    "- If a shot is in the air for more than 8 frames after being fired, it will lose about 0.56 damage every frame until it reaches 18 damage at frame 40.",

    "- Accuracy starts recovering 6 frames after the player stops shooting. The chance to shoot towards the outer reticle decreases by 1.5% per frame, if the chance is not already at the minimum, meaning that it takes 22 frames to reach maximum accuracy. (32 after shooting while jumping.)",
    "- Shots initially travel straight at a rate of 2.266 units per frame for 4 frames. Shots travel straight for 9.064 distance units.\nAfter that, the shot's velocity is set to 1.493 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.",
    "- The effective range is about 11.47 units.\nThis number may vary at different firing angles.",
