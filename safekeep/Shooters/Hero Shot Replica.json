    "This article is about the replica weapon, unlockable for use in versus battles. For the weapon used in various single-player Hero Modes, see Hero Shot.",
    "The Hero Shot Replica is a main weapon in the Splatoon series. It is a reskin of the Splattershot.",
    "The Hero Shot Replica, like the Splattershot and Hero Shot, vastly differs in appearance between games.",
    "In Splatoon, the Hero Shot Replica is identical to its game's Hero Shot with no upgrades, being mainly black and yellow with blue lights.",
    "In Splatoon 2, it is again identical to its relative game's Hero Shot, this time being mainly yellow with some black parts and being based on the Level 3 Hero Shot, which in turn resembles the real-life FN P90.",
    "In Splatoon 3, it is also identical in appearance to the single-player's Hero Shot.",
    "The Hero Shot Replica is a reskin of the Splattershot, with the same stats and loadout (Burst Bombs and Bomb Rush). It is only available from the Inkling Squid after completing all of its Octo Valley challenges.",
    "The Hero Shot Replica is based on the Hero Shot, the main shooter only usable in Octo Valley and during the Inkling Squid amiibo challenges. However, when the blueprints are given to Sheldon at Ammo Knights, the player is informed that he cannot recreate the technology used in the original gun, so only a replica could be made.",
    "The design appears to be modeled after a typical paint-ball gun.",
    "To unlock the Hero Shot Replica, the player must play the last set of missions from the Inkling Squid amiibo:",
    "Once the last challenge is finished, the Inkling Squid will award the player with cash and the blueprints for the Hero Shot, created by Ammoses Shellendorf, Sheldon's grandfather. Upon entering Ammo Knights, Sheldon will inform the player that although he cannot replicate the original technology, he can recreate it in design.",
    "[1]",
    "The Hero Shot Replica returns to Splatoon 2 with an updated model that is visually identical to the Level 3 Hero Shot from this game. However, it is once again mechanically identical to the Splattershot. It comes with the sub Burst Bomb and the special Splashdown. It is seemingly modeled after the real-life firearm, the FN Herstal P-90.",
    "To unlock the Hero Shot Replica, the player must complete every level with the Hero Shot in Octo Canyon.",
    "[2][3]",
    "The Hero Shot Replica is a different aesthetic take on the standard Splattershot model. This weapon came about after I made a breakthrough in my research and managed to create the ultimate weapon! Sadly, it never made it to mass production because the guys at the factory couldn't wrap their heads around my advanced schematics... So instead they just slapped some shiny parts on a standard Splattershot and called it the Hero Shot Replica. But it sure looks fresh, doesn't it? Give it a shot sometime.",
    "The Hero Shot Replica returns in Splatoon 3 with a new design. It has the same kit as the Splattershot. Its appearance is based on the Hero Shot after purchasing the Even Better Hero Shot upgrade from the Hero Gear.",
    "To unlock the Hero Shot Replica, the player must complete Return of the Mammalians.",
