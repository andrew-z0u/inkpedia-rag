    "The Annaki Splattershot Nova is a main weapon in Splatoon 3, and is the Annaki-branded version of the Splattershot Nova.",
    "The Annaki Splattershot Nova features the same design as the regular Splattershot Nova, but comes with raspberry-colored accents instead of the original weapon's lemon-yellow. It also has an Annaki logo on both sides of the front half that change to match the user's ink color.",
    "The Annaki Splattershot Nova was revealed on 16 May 2023 in the Sizzle Season 2023 trailer.[1] It was shown using an Ink Mine as its sub weapon and the Inkjet as its special weapon in a gameplay clip posted by Nintendo as promotional material for the S-BLAST '92 on 17 May 2023.[2]",

    "The Annaki Splattershot Nova is a fun collab with the fashion gear brand Annaki that also gives users a new loadout to experiment with. While you spray the landscape with that great Splattershot coverage, you can also set traps for enemies using the Ink Mine sub. Watch 'em flounder while teammates take 'em out, or fire up the Inkjet special and take care of business yourself from above. There's no wrong answer! This set is designed to help you protect key areas on the battlefield, so it's perfect for masterminds who hope to execute on a fastidiously planned battle strategy.",
