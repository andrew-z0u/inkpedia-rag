    "The L-3 Nozzlenose D is a main weapon in the Splatoon series. It is an alternative version of the L-3 Nozzlenose.",
    "The L-3 Nozzlenose D in Splatoon and Splatoon 2 is nearly identical in appearance to the L-3 Nozzlenose, with the only difference being the presence of its manufacturer's dolphin decal on the hose.",
    "In Splatoon 3, the L-3 Nozzlenose D has undergone a noticeable visual change, setting it further apart from its standard counterpart: its build is now significantly lighter in color, with most of the frame becoming white and all of the darker blue elements shifting to a significantly lighter shade. It retains the dolphin decal.",
    "The L-3 Nozzlenose D was released on 29 August 2015 at 02:00 UTC.[1] It has the same stats as its base weapon, the L-3 Nozzlenose, but comes with Burst Bombs and the Kraken.",
    "[2]",
    "The L-3 Nozzlenose D is a standard L-3 Nozzlenose, decorated with badges from its manufacturer. Its stats are unchanged, but this set includes Burst Bombs and the Kraken - an aggressive combination! Attack with a Burst Bomb, and then finish them with your shooter. It's an easy set to get the hang of!(NA)",
    "The L-3 Nozzlenose D was released on 6 January 2018 at 02:00 UTC.[3] It comes with Burst Bombs and the Inkjet.",
    "[4][5]",
    "The L-3 Nozzlenose D is a special model of the L-3 Nozzlenose with the maker's logo emblazoned on it! The two have the same stats, but this one pairs with Burst Bombs, letting you continually barrage your enemies! Easy to handle, the L-3 Nozzlenose(sic) is great for the aggressive player who wants to attack with precision and hit baddies with the Inkjet!",
    "The L-3 Nozzlenose D returns in Splatoon 3. It functions the same as the normal L-3 Nozzlenose, but has a different set and appearance. It has a its manufacturer's dolphin sticker on the side of the hose, as well as a light blue and white color scheme, as opposed to a darker color scheme on the original weapon. It was teased in the Fresh Season 2023 poster shown on February 16, 2023, and released on February 28, 2023. Its set consists of Burst Bomb and Ultra Stamp.",
    "[6]",
    "The L-3 Nozzlenose D is a special model of the L-3 Nozzlenose with the maker's logo emblazoned on it! But you know that's not all... it also has a fancy-schmancy new loadout! Including Burst Bombs to weaken foes a bit before finishing 'em off with your main weapon. And the special? None other than the Ultra Stamp, guaranteed to send anyone in your path running for cover. Don't underestimate the amount of ink you can fling with this setup, but it is a quirky combo. If you feel like making a big mess and experimenting, I hope you'll give it a try!",
    "For competitive tips about the L-3 Nozzlenose D",
    "The appended \"D\" in this weapon's name likely stands for \"Dolphin\", matching both the logo of its manufacturer and the dolphin theming of the base weapon's name in some languages.",
