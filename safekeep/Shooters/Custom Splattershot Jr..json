    "The Custom Splattershot Jr. is a main weapon in the Splatoon series. It is a variant of the Splattershot Jr., equipped with a star-shaped sticker on the side and an alternate loadout.",
    "The Custom Splattershot Jr. is nearly identical in appearance to the Splattershot Jr. The only difference between the two is that the Custom Splattershot Jr. has a large sticker of a two-tone orange star with cartoon eyes similar to the \"Jr. Mark\" symbol seen on the Basic Tee.",
    "In Splatoon 2, the Custom Splattershot Jr. and its variants also replace the user's standard ink tank with the one resembling baby bottles. It has a rounded rectangular shape and a round cap. For the Custom Splattershot Jr., an orange tag with the aforementioned two-tone orange star is attached around the bottle's neck. The main body changes color to match the wielder's ink color.",
    "The Custom Splattershot Jr. is the first weapon unlocked from Octo Valley. It can only be purchased after collecting the Sunken Scroll from the mission The Mighty Octostomp!. It comes in a set with Disruptors and the Echolocator.",
    "[1]",
    "I took my inspiration for this weapon from a strange liquid that was stuck to my grandpappy's blueprints! Its main weapon is just like the Splattershot Jr., but this one lets you weaken your foes with Disruptors! It also comes with an Echolocator, so rally your team behind you and charge into the fray!",
    "The Custom Splattershot Jr. returns in Splatoon 2. It was released on 9 September 2017 at 02:00 UTC.[2] It comes with Autobombs and Ink Storm.",
    "The Custom Splattershot Jr. was enhanced in Splatoon 2 with a 110% capacity ink tank. The high-capacity ink tank is unique to the Splattershot Jr. and its variants. This allows players to throw two Autobombs consecutively without having to refill the ink between throws. Activating the Ink Storm special refills the ink tank, so players can then throw two more Autobombs in a short time.",
    "[3][4]",
    "The Custom Splattershot Jr. offers the same functions as the Splattershot Jr. but with a twist on how you battle! Smoke out your opponents with Autobombs and splat them when they pop up! They can be combined with the Ink Storm special to smoke out opponents from a large area. I recommend this for players who like moving together as a team!",
    "The Custom Splattershot Jr. returns in Splatoon 3 in Chill Season 2022, with the same design it had in the previous games. It comes with Torpedoes and the Wave Breaker.",
    "[5]",
    "The Custom Spattershot Jr. offers the same function as the Splattershot Jr., but with a twist! Paired with the Torpedo sub weapon and Wave Breaker special, this loadout allows you to seek out and exploit your opponents' positions to maximize your team's advantage! I recommend this set for players who know there's no \"I\" in \"team,\" no \"L\" in \"victory,\" and who are just generally good at spelling overall.",
    "For competitive tips about the Custom Splattershot Jr.",
    "Custom Splattershot Jr. is a combination of Splatter (as well as Splat), Shot, and the shortened form of Junior (Jr.) at the end. It also has Custom as a prefix to differentiate it from the Splattershot Jr. Despite its name, it is not part of the Custom brand.",
