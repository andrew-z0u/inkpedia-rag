    "The Glamorz Splattershot features the same design as the regular Splattershot in Splatoon 3. Its ink tank now has the Emberz logo on it and sports a holographic color. The grip and muzzle now are silver with some pink parts, and the muzzle is adorned with red, blue and green glow sticks.",

    "Don't feel the existing Splattershot weapons have enough \"je ne sais splat\"? Well, check out the new Glamorz Splattershot codesigned by the fashion brand Emberz! I'm personally very impressed by the way light reflects and refracts off and through the main barrel. And by the Burst Bomb sub and Kraken Royale special! I recommend this set to well-rounded players who have the skills to adapt to all kinds of battle conditions.",
