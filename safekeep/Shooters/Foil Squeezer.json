    "The Foil Squeezer is a main weapon in Splatoon 2 & Splatoon 3. It is a Foil-branded variant of the Squeezer and comes with a different sub weapon and special weapon.",
    "In Splatoon 2, the Foil Squeezer is nearly identical in appearance to the Squeezer, the only difference between the two being that the Foil Squeezer has some gold foil bearing the Foil logo wrapped around the top of the bottle's neck.",
    "In Splatoon 3, the Foil Squeezer retains this bottleneck-foil, while the foil wrapping around the base of the bottle is green-and-white instead of red-and-white, and the handle is a darker shade of brown.",
    "The Foil Squeezer was released on 25 April 2018 at 02:00 UTC.[1] It comes with Splat Bombs and Bubble Blower.",
    "[2][3]",
    "We took a Squeezer, slapped the manufacturer's logo on it, and the Foil Squeezer was born. BOOM!\nThe main weapon has the action of the original Squeezer, but it now comes with Splat Bombs. So flush 'em out, then take careful aim!\nBlow up the front lines with the Bubble Blower special, then charge in with your team and take out the opposition!\nIt's a fairly aggressive set, but the main weapon requires steady aim, making it suited for veteran battlers.",
    "The Foil Squeezer returns in Splatoon 3 in Chill Season 2023. Its kit includes Autobomb sub weapon and the Splattercolor Screen special weapon. The weapon was revealed in the season's trailer on 15 November 2023. Its appearance has been altered to have green wrapping instead of red.",
    "[4]",
    "Like the Squeezer? You'll probably also like the Foil Squeezer! It offers the same capabilities with a new look and a new loadout. First, try deploying the Autobomb sub to sniff out hidden enemies. If the coast is clear, it's time to hold down the trigger and ink a ton of turf with your main. And with the Splattercolor Screen special, you can force enemies into more favorable positions to unleash the Foil Squeezer's powerful single-shot mode. KA-SPLOOSH! This loadout is designed to help you use both the sniping and turf-inking capabilities of your Foil Squeezer optimally, so I hope you'll give it a try!",
