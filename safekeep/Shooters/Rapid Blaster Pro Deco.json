    "The Rapid Blaster Pro Deco is a main weapon in the Splatoon series. It is the Deco-branded version of the Rapid Blaster Pro.",
    "The Rapid Blaster Pro Deco is nearly identical in appearance to the Rapid Blaster Pro. The only difference between the two is that the Rapid Blaster Pro Deco has stickers bearing the Deco logo on the sides. In Splatoon 3, the detailing on the weapon body is also blue instead of red.",
    "The Rapid Blaster Pro Deco was released on 25 December 2015 at 02:00 UTC.[1] It is identical to the Rapid Blaster Pro but comes with Disruptors and the Killer Wail.",
    "[2]",
    "The Rapid Blaster Pro Deco may be a bit of a mouthful, but it's worth it for that snazzy decoration! Its stats match the Rapid Blaster Pro's, but it includes Disruptors to weaken your foes before you splat them! Oh, and your Killer Wail can restrict them even more! Give this set a try if that's your sort of thing.(NA/EU/OC)",
    "The Rapid Blaster Pro Deco was released on 1 June 2018 at 00:00 UTC.[3] It comes with Splash Walls and the Ink Armor.",
    "[4][5]",
    "The Rapid Blaster Pro Deco is a Rapid Blaster Pro emblazoned with decorations from professional... decoration-ers! It has the same stats, but the Splash Wall sub lets you push out the front lines and set up shop! AND THAT'S NOT ALL! The Ink Armor special gives teammates the courage they need to join you in the heat of battle! This set is recommended for aggressive players who can manage their range!",
    "The Rapid Blaster Pro Deco returns in Splatoon 3 as part of the Sizzle Season 2023 update on 1 June 2023. The weapon received an official Twitter post from Nintendo on 22 May 2023 and its Tableturf card has been shown in the update's trailer posted by Nintendo. Its kit is the Angle Shooter and Killer Wail 5.1. Its visual appearance is like that of the Rapid Blaster Deco, but their physical appearances are different.",
    "[6]",
    "The Rapid Blaster Pro Deco is a Rapid Blaster Pro that's been spiffed up by top designers and paired with a new loadout. You'll get the same performance you're used to, but with the Angle Shooter sub, it's easier than ever to take out distant foes. And having the Killer Wail 5.1 special in your back pocket to clean up loose ends is always a treat. No one can escape the wail! This isn't the best set for up-close-and-personal splatting, but give it a try if you like to keep your distance in battle!",
