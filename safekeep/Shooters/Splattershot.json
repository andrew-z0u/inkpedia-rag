    "The Splattershot is a main weapon in the Splatoon series, created by the weapon brand Splat. It is an iconic weapon, commonly seen in promotional material and as part of multiple amiibo.",
    "The Splattershot resembles a toy water gun.",
    "In Splatoon, the grip and stock are both yellow-green, while the muzzle and forestock being a dark green. The muzzle is surrounded by a red-orange ring, and is shaped like a cone. On the top of the weapon is an ink tank in the shape of a capsule that changes color depending on the player's ink. The tank is connected to the stock by a yellow-green ring that goes down the middle of the tank, as well as by a red-orange tube at the back of the weapon.",
    "In Splatoon 2, the Splattershot received a new design that vastly differs from its Splatoon counterpart. The grip and stock are both purple, while the forestock and muzzle are a dark green. The muzzle is shaped like a cone, as well. On top of the weapon is an ink tank in the shape of a capsule that changes color depending on the player's ink. On the upper part of the end of the ink tank is a pink cap reminiscent of the caps used to fill a water gun. The ink tank is connected to the stock by a pink, diagonal facing ring that goes down the middle and back of the tank. On the bottom of the grip is what appears to be a magazine, colored dark green.",
    "In Splatoon 3, the Splattershot again has an updated design. The grip and stock are both purple, while the muzzle and forestock are both yellow. The muzzle is shaped like a cone, as well. On top of the weapon is an ink tank in the shape of a capsule that changes color depending on the player's ink. The tank is connected to the stock by a wavy yellow piece holder that juts out at the end of the tank. Also at the end of the tank is a blue, cone-shaped cap reminiscent of the caps used to fill a water gun.",
    "The Splattershot is an all-around weapon in terms of power, range, and rate of fire, making it easy to use for players of all levels of experience. It has a simplistic colorful look, similar to real life children's water guns. When utilized, it sprays a steady splattering of ink until the player's ink tank is depleted. It comes in a set with Burst Bombs and the Bomb Rush.",
    "[1]",
    "Ah, the classic Splattershot. It's a modified version of a weapon that was used in the Great Turf War. When this weapon made a splash with the youth, it helped to popularize the Turf Wars we know today! The full-auto Splattershot, Burst Bombs and Bomb Rush make this an ideal set for learning the ropes! Of course, even pro battlers might want to go back to basics and use this classic set once in a while!(EU/OC)",
    "Ah, the classic Splattershot. It's a modified version of a weapon that was used in the Great Turf War of old. When this weapon made a splash with the fresh kids, it helped popularize the Turf Wars we know today! The full-auto Splattershot, Burst Bombs and Bomb Rush make it a great choice for any situation. Whether you're a newbie or a pro, learn to use this set effectively and you'll be a force to be reckoned with!(NA)",
    "The weapon reappears in Splatoon 2 and has a new design. There is a cap where the tube connecting the barrel to the gun used to be, reminiscent of the caps used to refill a water gun full of water in real life. It had the Tenta Missiles as its special weapon in the Splatoon 2 Global Testfire demo, but in the final game it has the Splashdown.",
    "It appears in fifteen Octo Expansion stations:",
    "[2][3]",
    "The Splattershot is beloved for its ease of handling and high potential. This is the latest model of the go-to weapon! The included Burst Bombs are great for both attack and defense, and the Splashdown special doubles down on attack power. You can also use the Splashdown as a defensive ace up your sleeve, so it's perfect for learning the basics of battling! If you learn to make great use of this set, you'll be a force to be reckoned with! This all-around set is great for mastering the basics of battle.",
    "The Splattershot returns in Splatoon 3 with a new design. Its kit consists of Suction Bombs and the Trizooka, breaking the tradition of giving the Splattershot the Burst Bomb.",
    "It appears in four missions in Return of the Mammalians:",
    "[4]",
    "The Splattershot is beloved for its ease of handling and high potential. This is the latest model of the go-to weapon! Paired with Suction Bombs, you have a wonderfully stable loadout that allows you to respond to whatever the enemy throws at you. And let's not forget the Trizooka special. Let one off the leash at the right moment, and I guarantee your opponent won't forget! Is this setup a little basic? Yes! Basically one of the best setups you can have! Master the fundamentals, and you'll become a force to be reckoned with.",
    "For competitive tips about the Splattershot",
    "The Splattershot appears as Inkling's neutral special and in a few normals in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, alongside a variety of other weapons that they use in their attacks.",
    "For their neutral special, they shoot projectiles with the Splattershot at the opponent to deal damage. This also coats opponents in ink but does not ink the ground. The projectiles will decrease in range as the Inkling runs low on ink, and the Splattershot will not fire if the Inkling is out of ink. Similarly, for their rapid jab, the Inkling shoots the Splattershot, creating spurts at the muzzle which damages and inks opponents. This move also stops functioning when out of ink. For their forward throw, the Inkling fires a single shot directly into the opponent, covering them slightly and using a small amount of ink. In their other normals, they physically swing and hit opponents with the Splattershot itself. These moves do not cost ink.",
