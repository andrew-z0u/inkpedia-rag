    "The Luna Blaster Neo is a main weapon in the Splatoon series It is a Neo-branded variant of the Luna Blaster.",
    "In Splatoon and Splatoon 2, the Luna Blaster Neo is nearly identical in appearance to the Luna Blaster, with the only difference being a sticker bearing the Neo icon on the front half of the blaster in the former and the Neo icon and logo written in Inkling embossed on the front half of the blaster in the latter.",
    "In Splatoon 3, the Luna Blaster Neo's body is black instead of its base counterpart's white.",
    "The Luna Blaster Neo was released on 30 October 2015 at 02:00 UTC.[1][2] It comes in a set with Splat Bombs and the Bomb Rush.",
    "[3]",
    "The Luna Blaster Neo is a remodeled Luna Blaster made with original parts.\nThe Splat Bombs and Bomb Rush ensure that you'll cause a riot of inksplosions wherever you go!\nThis is definitely a set for those who prefer to throw caution to the wind and charge into the fray!(NA)",
    "The Luna Blaster Neo was released on 24 February 2018 at 02:00 UTC.[4] It comes in a set with Ink Mines and the Suction-Bomb Launcher.",
    "[5][6]",
    "The Luna Blaster Neo is basically just the Luna Blaster with a sweet sticker slapped on it. No reason to sugarcoat it.\nBut this time around, it comes with Ink Mines, which are great at slowing down enemy movement!\nThe special is the Suction-Bomb Launcher, so get clever with the time delay on the explosion to splat your opponents.\nRecommended for players that have mastered the art of being clever while looking good!",
    "The Luna Blaster Neo returns in Splatoon 3 with a new black design, coming with Fizzy Bombs and the Ultra Stamp. It was first shown in the Chill Season 2022 announcement trailer on 14 November 2022. It released on 1 December 2022 along with the release of the season.",
    "[7]",
    "Some say the Luna Blaster Neo is just a Luna Blaster with a sweet new design. I...may have said that myself. But the loadout as a whole is actually quite different! Of course, the weapon packs that same great punch as the original Luna Blaster, but if you find the range isn't enough, now you can fire off a Fizzy Bomb. And for those times you're politely knocking on the door but can't break through, the Ultra Stamp can help kick that thing down and get the splat party started! This set is cute as all get-out, but it's deadlier than a bathtub full of alligators. If you're into that kind of contrast, give it a try!",
