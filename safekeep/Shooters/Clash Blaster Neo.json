First, you've got Curling Bombs to help you glide across the map toward your enemies. You know what to do when you get there, right? And just when they're onto you, you can fire off the Super Chump to send a bunch of exploding Super Jump decoys into the mix. This is a balanced set that can help you pull off some flashy victories. Give it a try!",
