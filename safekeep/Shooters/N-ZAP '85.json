    "The N-ZAP '85 is a main weapon in the Splatoon series, created by the weapon brand Nintendo (not to be confused with the company).",
    "It has a high fire rate and takes four hits to splat an opponent. It highly resembles the original North American NES Zapper, an accessory for the Nintendo Entertainment System released in 1985, hence its name.",
    "The N-ZAP '85 consists of a mid-length gray barrel connected to a gray handhold with a white body. The sides of the body have the Nintendo logo printed in red, with one side also having the word \"Zapper\" and a copyright for the year 1985 printed. Notably, this text is all in English lettering, rather than the Inkling language, as it matches the decals of the real world NES Zapper exactly. Attached to the weapon's handhold is a red trigger.",
    "The N-ZAP '85 was the first weapon to be added post-release. It was released on 2 June 2015 at 02:00 UTC,[1] alongside the stage Port Mackerel and Ranked Battles. It is weaker than the Splattershot but it makes up for it with a higher fire rate. It comes with Splat Bombs and the Echolocator.",
    "[2]",
    "The N-ZAP '85 is a Shooter with excellent ink efficiency and rapid-fire capability! Its attack power isn't all that, but it's fabulous at quickly charging up the Echolocator special weapon. Combined with Splat Bombs, this set caters to fighters who like to cover a lot of ground in battle!(NA)",
    "The N-ZAP '85 is a Shooter that boasts incredible ink efficiency and rapid-firing capability! Its attack power is low, but it excels at hounding foes long after their weapons have run out of ink! With the Echolocator and Splat Bombs, this set suits fighters who like to cover a lot of ground in battle!(EU/OC)",
    "The N-ZAP '85 returns in Splatoon 2, looking identical to how it did in the first game. It comes with Suction Bombs and Ink Armor.",
    "It appears in one Octo Expansion station:",
    "[3][4]",
    "The N-ZAP '85 is a shooter with excellent ink efficiency and rapid-fire capability! Its attack power isn't all that, but you can use its features to ink turf quickly as you pursue your opponents! Use the Suction Bombs to further stick it to the baddies, and as you close in on them, pop your Ink Armor and watch them squirm! This weapon is the very definition of \"reliable.\" I recommend it for players who put a big emphasis on ink coverage!",
    "The N-ZAP '85 returns in Splatoon 3, looking identical to how it did in the previous games. Its kit consists of Suction Bombs and the Tacticooler.",
    "It appears in two missions in Return of the Mammalians:",
    "[5]",
    "Salmon Run Next Wave:[6]",
    "The N-ZAP '85 is a shooter with excellent ink efficiency and rapid-fire capability! And, um... its power is certainly... adequate. Sorry - I hate to say anything negative, but this weapon doesn't pack the biggest punch. But that's OK! It's fast enough to send your enemies scrambling... and that's when you hit 'em with the Suction Bombs. Fire up the Tacticooler to energize your squad for a big push, and you've got a nimble loadout that's built for teamwork. It's what makes the dream work!",
