    "The Colorz Aerospray is a main weapon in Splatoon 3. It is an Emberz-branded version of the Aerospray MG.",
    "The Colorz Aerospray looks nearly identical to the Aerospray MG. However, its steel is tempered, giving it a strong blue/purple tint. The Emberz logo is engraved instead of the usual Ammo Knights, and a circular ring in Emberz colors—neon red, neon green, and neon blue—is attached to the barrel of the weapon.",
    "The Colorz Aerospray appears in Splatoon 3 on 12 June 2025, as part of the Splatlands Collection. Its kit consists of Burst Bomb and Splattercolor Screen.",
    "[1]",
    "I can neither confirm nor deny that the brand Emberz designed the Colorz Aerospray based on a surplus of paint colors at their factory.\nBut I can confidently say that aside from the spiffy new look, this weapon's performance is unchanged. And it comes with both Burst Bombs and the Splattercolor Screen!\nAltogether, these weapons can throw your enemies into a state of confusion, leaving you free to spray your colors freely on the front lines.",
    "The word colorz is a stylized spelling of the word colors, referencing the Emberz brand.",
