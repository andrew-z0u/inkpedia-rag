    "The H-3 Nozzlenose D is a main weapon in the Splatoon series. It is the heavy version of the L-3 Nozzlenose D and an alternative version of the H-3 Nozzlenose.",
    "The H-3 Nozzlenose D in Splatoon and Splatoon 2 is nearly identical in appearance to the H-3 Nozzlenose, with the only difference being the presence of an added decal of the dolphin logo associated with its brand on the hose.",
    "In Splatoon 3, the H-3 Nozzlenose D has undergone a noticeable visual change, setting it further apart from its standard counterpart: its build is now significantly lighter in color, with most of the frame becoming white and all of the darker blue elements shifting to a significantly lighter shade. It retains the dolphin decal.",
    "The H-3 Nozzlenose D was released on 30 October 2015 at 02:00 UTC.[1][2] Its kit consists of Point Sensor and Inkzooka.",
    "[3]",
    "The H-3 Nozzlenose D is an H-3 Nozzlenose decorated with added badges from the manufacturer. The badges don't actually affect its abilities, but it does include a Point Sensor and the mighty Inkzooka! In the right hands, this interesting combination of abilities may give rise to many unique strategies!(NA)",
    "The H-3 Nozzlenose D was announced on 16 March 2018 at 09:00 UTC and released on 17 March 2018 at 02:00 UTC.[4] Its kit consists of Suction Bomb and Ink Armor.",
    "Before being officially announced, the H-3 Nozzlenose D appeared in the Version 3.0.0 preview section of the 8 March 2018 Nintendo Direct.[5]",
    "According to the Oatmealdome datamine from August 2017, the H-3 Nozzlenose D would have had Sprinkler as its sub weapon. However, a later update of the datamine showed the weapon with Suction Bomb, as did the final release.",
    "[6][7]",
    "The H-3 Nozzlenose D is an H-3 Nozzlenose decorated with added flair from the manufacturer. The flair doesn't make it stronger or anything, but it does come with Suction Bombs, which are great for pinning down your foes! Add Ink Armor to the mix, and this baby here is perfect for those who want the ability to turn the tide of battle.",
    "The H-3 Nozzlenose D returned in Splatoon 3 as part of the Sizzle Season 2023 update, released on 1 June 2023. Before so, the weapon had received an official Twitter post from Nintendo on 22 May 2023 and its Tableturf Battle Card had been shown in the update's trailer. Its kit consists of Splash Wall and Big Bubbler, carrying on the tradition of giving the H-3 Nozzlenose Splash Wall and a protective special, but doing it on a different variant. Its overall design remains the same as the H-3 Nozzlenose, but with a white and blue color scheme and a Dolphin sticker. Its color scheme is very similar to the L-3 Nozzlenose D.",
    "[8]",
    "The H-3 Nozzlenose D is a custom H-3 Nozzlenose emblazoned with the manufacturer's emblem. And while the weapon's performance is unchanged, it now comes with the Splash Wall sub weapon to help cover for the main weapon's low fire rate. Add in the Big Bubbler special for an extra dose of protection, and you've got a loadout that really maximizes what you can do with the main. Give it a try!",
    "For competitive tips about the H-3 Nozzlenose D",
    "The appended \"D\" in this weapon's name likely stands for \"Dolphin\", matching both the logo of its manufacturer and the dolphin theme of the base weapon's name in some languages.",
