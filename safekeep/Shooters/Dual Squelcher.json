    "The Dual Squelcher is a main weapon in Splatoon, created by Custom. In Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3, it was converted into Dualie Squelchers.",
    "It is similar to the Jet Squelcher, but has a higher fire rate at the cost of range and power. The fire rate is faster than the Splattershot Pro and slower than the Splash-o-matic.",
    "The Dual Squelcher is similar in appearance to the Jet Squelcher. However, the Dual Squelcher is red and has a second barrel attached to the bottom. This barrel is nonfunctional in-game.",
    "The Dual Squelcher comes in a set with Splat Bomb and Echolocator.",
    "[1]",
    "The Dual Squelcher adds a manifold mechanism to the Jet Squelcher for extreme range and firing rate. Claim turf, fire out those Echolocators, and then attack the opponents' position with Splat Bombs! So I'd recommend it if those kinds of tricksy tactics happen to be your style!",
