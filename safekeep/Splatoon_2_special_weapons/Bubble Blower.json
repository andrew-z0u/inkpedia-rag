    "The Bubble Blower is a special weapon in Splatoon 2.",
    "The Bubble Blower, when activated, gives the user a bubble wand that is about the same size as them. Said bubble wand is simply a black stick with a large, flimsy, circular part with bubble material in it at the top. There is a canister of bubble material attached to the wand that changes color to match the user's ink. The bubbles that are blown with the wand are transparent with swirls of the user's ink in them. The more the user or the user's teammates shoot the bubbles, the larger they grow and the more ink is put into them. The more the opposing team shoots the bubbles, the smaller they grow and the more ink is removed from them.",
    "The Bubble Blower allows players to create three large bubbles. The bubbles slowly move and bounce in the direction the player fired them. As the bubbles move, they grow when hit by the user's ink and shrink when hit by the opposing team's ink. If the player or their team pops the bubble, a lethal blast of ink splats any enemy close to the bubble and inks the area. If too much time passes without a bubble being popped, or if the enemy pops one, it fizzles away without a deadly blast of ink.",
    "Equipping Special Power Up with Bubbler Blower increases the size and blast radius of the bubbles.",

    "These bubbles will shrivel up if hit by enemy ink.",
