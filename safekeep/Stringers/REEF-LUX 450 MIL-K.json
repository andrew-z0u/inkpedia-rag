    "Some might say that the REEF-LUX is really more like a \"skim Tri-Stringer.\" Well, with the REEF-LUX 450 MIL-K, Barazushi has delivered the cream of the crop. Paired now with the Torpedo sub, this set is excellent for sniffing out opponent locations and then sopping them up with a charged shot from your main. And if you find yourself in a pinch? You've got Booyah Bombs chilling in the fridge. This set can turn anyone lactose intolerant and will have your enemies raising the white flag!",
    "The suffix \"MIL-K\" is a stylized spelling of the word milk.",
