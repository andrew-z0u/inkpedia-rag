    "[1]",
    "On the surface, the REEF-LUX 450 Deco is what you might expect — a decorated version of the REEF-LUX 450. But with a fresh loadout, it offers new possibilities. For instance, you can now stake out a safe area with the Splash Wall sub, allowing you a window of opportunity to snipe far-off foes with fully charged shots. And when that special gauge is full, don't hesitate to twist the wrist and fire off a Reefslider special. It's a great way to help push the front line forward for your team. I recommend this set for folks who simply love inking turf but also want the option to boldly venture behind enemy lines when the moment is right.",
