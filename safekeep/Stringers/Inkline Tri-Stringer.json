    "The Inkline Tri-Stringer is a main weapon in Splatoon 3. It is an Inkline-branded version of the Tri-Stringer.",
    "The Inkline Tri-Stringer mostly shares its appearance with the Tri-Stringer, except that the fishing rod is made out of a different material and has the Inkline logo emblazoned on one side. The nozzles and the center tube's cap are also colored olive green instead of black.",
    "The Inkline Tri-Stringer became available on 1 September 2023 at 00:00 UTC. It comes in a set with the Sprinkler and Super Chump.",
    "[1]",
    "The Inkline Tri-Stringer is a fresh collab between the makers of the original Tri-Stringer and Inkline. With a new loadout and look, I hope Tri-Stringer fans will check it out! For those on the fence, I've got ideas about how to take advantage of this set's strengths. Try luring enemies with the Sprinkler—a fully charged Tri-Stringer shot will take 'em out! And you have the Super Chump decoy to help you take advantage of the main weapon's ultra-long range and firepower. I think this setup really lets the Inkline Tri-Stringer shine, so give it a fully charged shot!",
