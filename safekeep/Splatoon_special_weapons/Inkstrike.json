    "The Inkstrike is a special weapon in Splatoon, and is also used by Octostrikers.",
    "The Inkstrike consists of two parts, the Inkstrike itself and a touchpad used to launch it. The touchpad is yellow-green with green handles and a red antenna. The screen displays a multicolored swirl pattern in the middle and some boxes displaying information on the left with a black background. The Inkstrike itself is shaped like a missile. The main part of its body changes color to match the user's ink, the bottom part is yellow-green with red highlights and a green propeller, and the top part is red with black-and-white googly eyes on it. Strapped around the main body are some yellow-green supports that are connected via a red handle. Once the Inkstrike is launched, a warning marker appears where it will land. Said marker is a half-sphere with stripes that change color to match the user's ink. A black squid-shaped arrow with highlights in the user's ink color surrounds it. When used by an Octostriker, the marker has an octopus-shaped arrow instead of a squid-shaped one.",
    "Once activated, the user targets a specific area of the stage by tapping it on the . When about to launch, the attacker covers their ears with the pad in their hand and ducks their head a little. The Inkstrike is then launched to that location, creating a large tornado of ink that splats enemies caught in it.",
    "In Octo Valley, Octostrikers fire Inkstrikes from a cannon on their helmet.",
    "The amount of turf an Inkstrike covers largely varies but typically ranges from 80 to 100BP. Based on the area of each stage and the amount of inkable vs uninkable turf, an Inkstrike typically contributes 4-6% of the total coverage without including the base percentages earned from each spawn point (which is typically around 5 to 6BP).",
    "Though the Inkstrike does not return in Splatoon 2, a drawing of one appears on a Sunken Scroll explaining the absence of Splatoon's special weapons and on the bulletin boards in Skipper Pavilion. The same drawing can be seen on the back wall of Inkopolis Square.",
    "The role of the Inkstrike is indirectly replaced by the Tenta Missiles, in that they are both able to lock on from far away to summon large ink projectiles from the air, and the Booyah Bomb and Splashdown, in that they both create a swirling ink explosion. Octostrikers do not return either, but their role has been replaced by the Missile Octocopter, which only appears as sanitized in the Octo Expansion, which they fire Tenta Missiles instead.",
    "The Inkstrike does not return in Splatoon 3, but the game introduces a spiritual successor to it with the Triple Inkstrike, which, as the name suggests, fires three small ink tornadoes instead of one large one. In addition, instead of being targeted with the , which the Nintendo Switch does not possess, it is instead targeted with three small throw-able targeting beacons which stick to objects, contained in a backpack.",
    "An unlockable ATV based on the Inkstrike, called the Inkstriker, appears as a vehicle in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Like the other Splatoon-themed vehicle in the game, the Splat Buggy, it has a unique audiovisual effect where its exhaust pipes spray ink rather than flames during a speed boost. Its ink color matches the color of the Inkling using it or is purple if using any other character. There is also a sticker on the front of the vehicle that depicts a street sign from Splatoon when playing as an Inkling or a ? Block when playing as any other character.",

    "- Because using the Inkstrike prevents players from spreading ink momentarily and requires them to concentrate on the , those using an Inkstrike can be easily splatted. When using an Inkstrike, make sure to stay a safe distance away from the action, or hide behind a wall.",
    "- When an Inkstrike is placed, a large, swirling icon will appear on the battlefield. Quickly evacuate this area to avoid being splatted.",
    "- In Ranked Battle, using an Inkstrike directly on top of a Splat Zone or a Tower can turn the tide of the battle. In Rainmaker, it can easily destroy the shield or keep enemies from picking up the Rainmaker.",
    "- In Turf War, players can use the Inkstrike as a distraction by launching it at the opponents' side of the map. To make this strategy more efficient, it is best to have clothing with the ability Special Charge Up.",
    "- Launching an Inkstrike deep into enemy territory at the end of a Turf War can cause an unavoidable swing of about 6% or 7%, which can determine the winner of a match.",
    "- While Splatoon was in development, the Inkstrike was referred to as an Ink Tornado and caused a large dome of ink to appear, instead of the current tornado design.",
