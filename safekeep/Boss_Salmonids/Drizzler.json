    "Drizzlers are Boss Salmonids that appear in Salmon Run in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3.",
    "The Drizzler uses its armored metal umbrella to fly around the stage. Once it finds a spot close to a player, it will land and use its umbrella as a shield, from which it will aim. The Drizzler will fire a floating projectile, resembling a Torpedo, which will rain down ink similarly to an Ink Storm once it bursts. The recoil from its weapon causes the Drizzler to flip upside-down after firing, leaving itself vulnerable to being splatted. Shooting a projectile will deflect it, which can defeat the Drizzler upon a direct hit. While flying, its tail is exposed, rendering it susceptible to attack. Additionally, if a Drizzler is on uneven terrain, players can shoot under its umbrella while it is stationary and shielded.",

    "Splatting Drizzlers a specific number of times in Salmon Run Next Wave will reward the player with special badges that they can use on their Splashtag.",

    "- Drizzlers travel toward the nearest player upon take-off, which can be used to lure them near the Egg Basket for quick Golden Egg collection.\nWhen using this technique, do not enter their firing distance or they will fire torpedoes before further approaching.",
    "- Drizzlers will target said nearest player when firing projectiles. If possible, the target should be positioned away from the rest of the crew or towards the sea to minimize Ink Storm damage and enemy ink coverage.",
    "- Players can determine where the Drizzler will fire its Ink Storm projectile by observing where its scope points.\nA Drizzler projectile has 100 HP. Upon depleting its HP, the projectile flies downwards facing the same direction as the player at that time. In order to deflect the projectile back at the Drizzler, players need to align themselves so that the projectile lines up between them and the Drizzler or it will miss. Therefore, players should move where they see the Drizzler pointing its scope.\nFor slow traveling weapons like the Grizzco Slosher, even if the projectile is hit at a slightly off direction, as long as the player is aligned correctly before the projectile is hit, it will still hit the Drizzler.",
    "- The Drizzler will fire the Ink Storm twice in one location before moving on to another.\nIt takes about seven seconds for Drizzlers to re-fire the Ink Storm.",
    "- The fired projectiles have a metal casing that peels off, revealing a green balloon that slowly rises in the air and finally launches off and forms an Ink Storm.\nThe Drizzler remains exposed until the Ink Storm is formed, allowing time for the player to hit it with the projectile, metal casing present or not.",
    "- The Sting Ray and other armor-piercing weapons are capable of damaging the Salmonid within even when it is not exposed.\nTo ensure players get the most out of their Sting Ray, they can line up Drizzlers with other armored Boss Salmonids or Stingers to splat multiple bosses at once.",
