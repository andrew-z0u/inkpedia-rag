    "Big Shots are Boss Salmonids that appear in Salmon Run Next Wave in Splatoon 3.",
    "The Big Shot is a large-bodied Boss Salmonid that wears turquoise overalls and has a short, stubby, lime-green bit of hair on its head. It spawns with a Big Shot launcher near the shoreline and fires a cannonball that will land near the egg basket. The cannonball then bounces up and down in a similar fashion to the Wave Breaker. However, the projectile sends off two shock waves before breaking, while the Wave Breaker emits three. The Big Shot itself has considerably high health, but cannot attack directly and merely travels to and from the water to load cannonballs into the launcher. The launcher cannot be broken and will remain until the end of the wave, similarly to the pillar of the Fish Stick.",
    "Even before the Big Shot is defeated, players can use its Big Shot launcher to fire Golden Eggs toward the egg basket. If multiple Big Shots spawn in a wave, they will all use the same launcher.",

    "The term Big Shot means a person in a higher class or ranking than most, and is also a play on words relating to its cannon and its size.",

    "- Load any nearby Golden Eggs in the Big Shot Launcher to fire them toward the basket. The launcher is very useful for getting eggs closer to the basket, but be sure another player is there to pick them up, otherwise Snatchers may steal them before they can be collected.\nAvoid spending too much time around the Big Shot Launcher, as staying near the shore can be dangerous.\nEggs can also be fired from the cannon during an Xtrawave, functioning the same as a normal wave. This allows players to relocate groups of eggs to the basket if needed.",
