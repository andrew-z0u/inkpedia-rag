    "The Crab Tank is a special weapon in Splatoon 3. It is a piloted assault vehicle that can both rapidly fire ink shots and launch explosive ink blobs.",
    "The Crab Tank is a crab-shaped mech that can curl up into a ball. Its outer shell changes color to match the user's ink. It is armed with three turret-like cannons, one on each front limb, and one in the center of its body.",
    "The Crab Tank can walk and strafe like players, or curl up into a ball to move faster and climb up walls, inking the surface as it moves, similar to the Baller. Like a real crab, the tank walks faster side-to-side than it does forwards or backwards. When climbing, the crab tank cannot move left and right, only up and down.",
    "The Crab Tank has 500 HP and has varying damage multipliers against certain weapons:",
    "In walking mode, the tank has two firing modes: pressing  fires a ball of ink in an arc that pierces enemies and explodes on contact similar to the Explosher, while  fires a rapid stream of bullets from two turrets, similar to dualies. Continuously shooting with  increases the Crab Tank's firing rate drastically; it starts with a fire rate similar to the .96 Gal, but the peak rate of fire is the same as the Hydra Splatling. Interrupting the continuous fire by rolling, using the cannon with , or letting go of  will reset the fire rate to its starting point. The user sits on the back of the tank, where they can be damaged from above, behind, or the side.",
    "In ball mode, the Crab Tank can move in all directions freely and climb walls, leaving a path of ink behind itself and dealing modest contact damage to enemies. It can also do a small \"crab hop\" by pressing . The player is completely protected in ball mode, and can heal at an accelerated rate similar to swim form. Although the Crab Tank turns and adjusts its aim very slowly while in walking mode, it faces in the direction of the camera when coming out of ball mode. Switching to ball mode and back to walking mode can allow it to turn more quickly, although the special cannot fire for a brief period after exiting ball mode (except in Salmon Run Next Wave).",
    "The Crab Tank flashes red when its duration is almost up, warning the user the special will run out soon. Once the special ends, the crab tank will disappear and the player can move after a short delay. If the tank itself is destroyed, the player is ejected rather than splatted, and the special ends.",
    "This special is one of the nine available specials in Salmon Run Next Wave.",
    "It appears in 4 Return of the Mammalians missions:",
    "Equipping Special Power Up with Crab Tank increases its duration. The following table shows the duration, in number of frames, when stacking Special Power Up.[1]",
    "Wining a certain number of battles with the Crab Tank will reward the player with special badges that they can use on their Splashtag.",
