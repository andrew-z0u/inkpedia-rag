    "The Big Bubbler is a special weapon in Splatoon 3. It is a spherical barrier that blocks incoming enemy attacks and allows teammates to Super Jump to it like a Squid Beakon.",
    "The Big Bubbler consists of three parts: the barrier generator, its launcher, and the barrier itself. The launcher is an Inkling (or Octoling) sized spinning top launcher which changes color to match the user's ink, faces upwards and contains a Squid Beakon of the same color at the top. It has a black ripcord which is pulled off when the generator is launched upwards. The generator itself has a hemispherical shape, changes color to match the user's ink, and has a white aerial screw on the top as its propeller. The barrier itself is a big translucent sphere that changes color to match the user's ink with similarly colored lines going across it.",
    "When activated, the player places a Squid Beakon-like launcher at their feet and launches a generator into the air that emits a large, spherical barrier. This barrier blocks incoming enemy attacks but cannot block opponents from passing through it nor enemy attacks coming from within the barrier. Shots blocked by the Big Bubbler damage it, shrinking the barrier. Attacks that hit the launcher or the generator deal increased damage.",
    "The Big Bubbler has 1536 base HP, with attacks to the launcher and generator dealing 1x damage and attacks to the barrier dealing 0.64x damage. The Big Bubbler takes 92.1 damage per second while it is active (184.2 if placed on the tower in Tower Control) and dissipates when it reaches 0 HP.[1] There is no hidden duration timer.",
    "If deployed underneath an object, the generator can get stuck, resulting in a smaller barrier being emitted. If the user tries to deploy the Big Bubbler in the air, too close to an edge, or underneath very low ceilings, the special cannot be used and will give a \"Can't Use!\" prompt.",
    "Moving platforms that intersect with the launcher will destroy the Big Bubbler while platforms that intersect with the generator will not. If placed on a moving platform, both the launcher and the hovering generator will move with it.",
    "When used, the user cannot charge another Big Bubbler until it has been destroyed.",
    "Equipping Special Power Up with Big Bubbler increases its maximum HP to up to 1843.2 HP. Since the damage over time is not changed, this also boosts its duration.[1]",
    "Winning a certain number of battles with the Big Bubbler will reward the player with special badges that they can use on their Splashtag.",
