    "The Refurbished Mini Splatling is a main weapon in Splatoon. It is a Mini Splatling with a different loadout and a white-and-orange color scheme.",
    "It has a very short charge time, needing approximately 0.33 seconds to reach the first level of charge, and 0.5 seconds to reach the second level of charge. It has more maneuverability than the Heavy Splatling. However, its range is significantly shorter than the Heavy Splatling, with a lower firing duration, only shooting for 0.6 seconds at the first level of charge and 1.2 seconds at the second level of charge. Each fully charged attack consumes 15% of the ink tank capacity, allowing users to fire six full charges before needing to refill. Each ink bullet deals enough damage to splat opponents in four hits.",
    "The Refurbished Mini Splatling shares its overall design with the Mini Splatling. However, the Refurbished Mini Splatling is almost completely white with orange barrels, has an orange tube connecting the ink tank to the gun, and an ink tank that changes color to match the user's ink.",

    "スプラスピナーリペア Supura Supinā Ripea is a combination of either Splat or Splash, and Spinner. Spinner is due to the fact that the barrels of the Mini Splatling rotate while charging and firing. リペア Ripea refers to the fact that the Refurbished Mini Splatling has been repaired, similar to the English name.",
