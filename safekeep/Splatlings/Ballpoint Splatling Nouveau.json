    "The Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau is a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3. It is the Nouveau-branded version of the Ballpoint Splatling.",
    "Same as its original variant, this splatling works differently from other splatlings. It does not have a consistent range when firing in short bursts. There are two stages of firing with this weapon. The first stage only lasts for a quarter ring charge and has a range similar to the Splattershot Jr., fires faster than other splatlings, and has mobility slightly higher than the Mini Splatling. When charged more than a quarter ring, the range increases dramatically, having a range in between the Heavy Splatling and Hydra Splatling. During its second stage of firing, it has almost perfect accuracy but fires slightly slower than other splatlings.",
    "The Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau can recharge itself by pressing  at any time while it is firing. When recharging the shots, the weapon maintains the property of whichever stage it was on. However, a charge exceeding 1¾ rings automatically defaults the weapon back to the first stage. Additionally, the weapon can maintain its stage two charge even after it has finished firing by starting another charge within one second.",
    "The Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau has a nearly consistent charge rate for both rings. It takes 0.83 seconds to reach the first level of charge, and 1.66 seconds in total to reach the second level of charge. Once the first level of charge is reached, it fires for approximately 1.66 seconds, and once the second level of charge is reached, it fires for approximately 3.33 seconds.",
    "The Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau has the same appearance as the Ballpoint Splatling, but has a Nouveau sticker on the back end. In Splatoon 3, its colors are also inverted, with the stock being white instead of black, and the grip being black instead of white.",
    "The Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau was announced on 24 November 2018. It was added to the game on 5 December 2018 as part of version 4.3.0.[1]",
    "[2]",
    "The Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau has all the charm and stats of the original, but comes with a set that offers a different style of play!\nCreate an outpost for teammates to jump to with the Squid Beakon sub, and use it to pile on the pressure and keep the offense turned on!\nWhat's more, the Ink Storm special can help provide much needed cover when your allies are pushing the attack!\nIf the refinement of the Ballpoint Splatling is your style, but your heart yearns for something more, give this set a try!",
    "The Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau returns in Splatoon 3 as part of the Drizzle Season 2023. Its design is updated, as the parts of the weapon that were black and white in the unbranded variant are swapped. Its kit consists of Ink Mine and Ink Vac.",
    "[3]",
    "The Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau offers the same capable performance of the original but with a new look and a new loadout to help you write a different story! Pepper the field with Ink Mines to bookmark your enemies for easy splatting later. And use the Ink Vac special to set up the ultimate plot twist—literally reversing enemy progress and making it easier for your team to move around the map and splat freely! Just remember—even if you fancy yourself a brilliant writer, you could use a coauthor. This set is designed with teamwork in mind, so don't be afraid to collaborate!",
