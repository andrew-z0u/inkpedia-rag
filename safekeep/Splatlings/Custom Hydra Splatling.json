    "The Custom Hydra Splatling is a main weapon in the Splatoon series. It is a Hydra Splatling with Custom branding and a different loadout.",
    "The Hydra Splatling must be charged up to fire a continuous spray of ink, like all splatlings. It distinguishes itself from the others by having the longest range and slowest charge time. It is the only splatling capable of splatting opponents with three ink bullets, as it has an exclusive high-damage feature that activates when the weapon is fully charged. The Hydra Splatling's mobility is low, so speed is impaired when it is equipped, even when not attacking with the weapon.",
    "The Custom Hydra Splatling is nearly identical in appearance to the Hydra Splatling. The only two differences between the two is that the Custom Hydra Splatling has a sticker bearing the Custom logo on the side of the tank, and, in Splatoon 3, the addition of the hose that connects the tank to the weapon now being light blue instead of yellow.",
    "The Custom Hydra Splatling was released on 16 January 2016 at 02:00 UTC.[1][2] It was initially said to be the final weapon to be released before the release of Sheldon's Picks.[3][4] It comes as a set with Sprinklers and the Bubbler.",
    "[5]",
    "The Custom Hydra Splatling is a Splatling packing all the destructive power of the original! The main weapon's barrage of ink combines with the Sprinkler to charge up the Bubbler in no time flat! But you might find yourself in a figurative pickle if the enemy gets too close, so be cautious with this set!(NA)",
    "The Custom Hydra Splatling is a Splatling packing all the destructive power of the original! The Main weapon's barrage of ink combines with the Sprinkler to charge up the Bubbler in no time at all! If your opponents get too close, you could be in a real pickle, so this setup suits a cautious battler!(EU/OC)",
    "The Custom Hydra Splatling was released on 1 August 2018 at 00:00 UTC.[6] It comes with Ink Mines and Ink Armor.",
    "[7]",
    "The Custom Hydra Splatling is a splatling cannon packing all the destructive power of the original! Lay a trap for your opponents with the Ink Mine sub weapon, and then find a good spot to lay the splat down with your main's rapid fire! The Ink Mines don't use a lot of ink, so you can place two of them at a time. Use the Ink Armor special to survive attacks long enough to strike back! Recommended for those who value defensive offensiveness!",
    "The Custom Hydra Splatling returns in Splatoon 3 as part of Sizzle Season 2024. The strap has been recolored, now being light blue, instead of the typical yellow. The weapon comes with Ink Mine and Splattercolor Screen.",
    "[8]",
    "The Custom Hydra Splatling is a splatling cannon packing all the destructive power of the original! The Ink Mine sub weapon will give you an early warning about any foes rude enough to approach so that you can lay the splat down with your main's rapid fire! If you're struggling with a foe's long-range weapon, use the Splattercolor Screen to cut off their line of sight. That should give your team all the chance you need to break through! I'd recommend this to anyone who wants to maintain a tight defense all the way up to the enemy's front line!",
    "For competitive tips about the Custom Hydra Splatling",
    "Custom Hydra Splatling is derived from Custom; Hydra, a mythological multi-headed water monster, and a portmanteau of Splat and Gatling. Hydra may also be short for Hydrant, since the Custom Hydra Splatling is based on a fire hydrant in design. The prefix Custom is also used to differentiate it from the Hydra Splatling. This trait is shared among the other alternate sets of the Custom brand.",
    "ハイドラントカスタム Haidorantokasutamu is derived from Hydrant and Custom. Hydrant refers to a fire hydrant. Like the English name, \"Custom\" is also used to differentiate it from Hydrant.",
