    "The Heavy Splatling Remix is a main weapon in Splatoon and Splatoon 2. It is a Heavy Splatling with a different set and color scheme.",
    "It is capable of firing bursts of ink with long range, low damage, and a fast fire rate. Although relatively slow to charge, each ink bullet does enough damage to splat opponents in four hits.",
    "The Heavy Splatling Remix is nearly identical in appearance to the Heavy Splatling. In Splatoon, the only differences between the two is that the Heavy Splatling Remix has a sticker bearing the Chirpy Chips logo on the front and side of the water jug and a more neon color scheme. In Splatoon 2, the sticker is still present, but unlike the Splatoon 2 Heavy Splatling, the Heavy Splatling Remix's water jug is horizontal to the barrel instead of being diagonal, as it is in Splatoon.",
    "The Heavy Splatling Remix was released on 8 June 2016 as part of Sheldon's Picks Vol. 2. Its set consists of Sprinkler and Killer Wail.",

    "The Heavy Splatling Remix is a, uh, remixed version of the Heavy Splatling with very similar capabilities. \nYou'll find the Sprinkler and Main weapon charge up the Killer Wail in no time at all! \nThis set is perfect for a battlefield artiste who likes to set the tempo of an engagement! \n(NA)",

    "The Heavy Splatling Remix was released on 3 April 2019 at 01:00 UTC as part of Version 4.6.0.[3] Its set consists of Point Sensor and Booyah Bomb.",
    "[4]",
    "The Heavy Splatling Remix handles just like the original Heavy Splatling, but with a brand new coat of paint and a fresh loadout to boot! Pinpoint enemy locations with the Point Sensor sub, then send them packing with a rapid-fire barrage! And then? Drop the Booyah Bomb special when it counts to support your team and set the rhythm of battle rocking in your favor! Sequence the staccato beat of your splatling, the pulse of your sub, and the bass drop of your special to create a symphony of destruction!",
    "For competitive tips about the Heavy Splatling Remix",
    "Heavy Splatling Remix is derived from the adjective Heavy and a portmanteau of Splat and Gatling plus the word Remix. Remix refers to the fact that the weapon is a remodeled Heavy Splatling, similar to how remix is used in musical media. Remix is also likely a reference to Chirpy Chips and their electronic music style, since the design of the Heavy Splatling Remix is inspired by them.",
    "バレルスピナーリミックス Bareru Supinā Rimikkusu is derived from Barrel and Spinner plus Remix. The name Barrel Spinner is because the barrels of the Heavy Splatling Remix rotate while charging and firing. Remix has the same reasoning as the English name.",
