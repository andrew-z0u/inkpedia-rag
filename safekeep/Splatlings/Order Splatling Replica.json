    "- The matchmaking range is 21. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.",
    "- The full charge ink consumption is 22.5%, allowing the user to fully charge 4.44 times on a full ink tank.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).",
    "- The Order Splatling Replica cannot store its charge.",
    "- It takes 48 frames to charge the first circle (0.8 seconds) and 72 frames to fully charge (1.2 seconds).\nWhen airborne or low on ink, it takes 192 frames to charge the first circle (3.2 seconds) and 288 frames to fully charge (4.8 seconds).",
    "- The Order Splatling Replica is not rechargeable while firing.",
    "- When charged to the first circle, the weapon will fire for 80 frames (1.33 seconds), and when fully charged, it will fire for 160 frames (2.67 seconds).\nThe firing duration is 1.67 times longer than the charging duration when charged to the first circle and 2.22 times longer when fully charged.",
    "- When firing continuously, it shoots a bullet every 4 frames (15 shots per second).",
    "- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.07 units per frame.\nWhen charging, the player's movement speed is set to 0.062 units per frame.",
    "- After firing, there is a 40 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.",
    "- Each shot has a base damage of 30, regardless of charge level.",

    "- Initial shot velocity scales with charge level. At minimum charge, it is 1.05 units per frame, and at once charge circle or more, it is 2.1 units per frame. Shots travel straight for 8 frames, regardless of charge level.\nAfter that, the shot's velocity is set to 1.5105 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.",
    "- Effective range scales from 9.98 units to 18.98 units, depending on charge level.\nThis number may vary at different firing angles.",
