    "Barazushi has given the Mini Splatling a fierce makeover, and the result is the Mini Splatling RTL-R! It's the same great Mini Splatling performance with a tough new look. If I were headed into battle with this set, I'd call my allies with the Squid Beakon and then use my Trizooka special to open a breach. We'd snake in together and win the day! You do you, but I'd recommend this set to anyone who has similar daydreams about banding together as a team in victory.",
    "The suffix \"RTL-R\" is a stylized spelling of the word rattler, a common name for rattlesnakes, regarding the weapon's snake skin-like texture.",
