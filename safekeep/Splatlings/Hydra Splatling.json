    "The Hydra Splatling is a main weapon in the Splatoon series.",
    "The Hydra Splatling must be charged up to fire a continuous spray of ink, like all splatlings. It distinguishes itself from the others by having the longest range and slowest charge time. It is the only splatling capable of splatting opponents with three ink bullets, as it has an exclusive high-damage feature that activates when the weapon is fully charged. The Hydra Splatling's mobility is low, so speed is impaired when it is equipped, even when not attacking with the weapon.",
    "The Hydra Splatling mainly consists of a large silver tank connected to a red body via a yellow tube. The tank has several white warning labels on it as well as some red text. The body has three silver barrels with gold tips sticking out of it.",
    "In Splatoon 3, the Hydra Splatling received a redesign. The large silver tank has been made slightly larger, with the Custom logo being flipped vertically, the hydrant has been remodeled, adding a coil and a handle and an interconnecting attachment added to the barrels.",
    "The Hydra Splatling was released on 21 November 2015 at 02:00 UTC.[1][2] It comes in a set with Splat Bombs and Echolocator.",
    "[3]",
    "The Hydra Splatling is a Splatling designed to really pressure your opponents' turf with a barrage of ink! However, a long charge time and large ink consumption make it a liability in close quarters! The Splat Bomb sub weapon can be used to repel any opponents who get too close. The Echolocator allows you to advance forward without fear of being flanked!(NA)",

However, a long charge time and large ink consumption make it a liability at close quarters! The Splat Bomb Sub weapon can be used to repel any opponents who get too close. The Echolocator allows you to provide effective rearguard support for a forward offensive.(EU/OC)",
    "The Hydra Splatling returns to Splatoon 2 on 25 November 2017 at 02:00 UTC.[4][5] It comes as a set with Autobombs and Splashdown.",
    "It appears in four Octo Expansion stations:",
    "[6]",
    "The Hydra Splatling is a splatling designed to really pressure your opponents' turf with extreme firepower! However, a very long charge time and heavy ink consumption make it a liability in close quarters! Use the Autobombs to keep foes at bay so you can maintain the range at which this set excels! Opponents about to pounce when you've finished shooting? Let 'em get close, and then spring the trap with your Splashdown special! Are you the type that likes to keep your distance? This is the set for you!",
    "The Hydra Splatling returns in Splatoon 3 with a slightly updated design, and comes with Autobomb and Booyah Bomb as its kit.",
    "It appears in two missions in Return of the Mammalians:",
    "[7]",
    "The Hydra Splatling is designed to impose extreme pressure on your opponents' turf through superior firepower. However, because the weapon takes so long to charge, it's definitely a liability in close quarters. I recommend using your Autobombs to fend off incoming bogeys—and they can even help reveal far-off opponents who can be splatted from long range! If anyone DOES make it past your defenses, the unwelcome surprises aren't over. This loadout allows you to greet them with a Booyah Bomb! Mi casa is NOT su casa! I recommend this setup for all you homebodies who want to set up camp and never leave—supporting your team through long-range firepower instead!",
    "For competitive tips about the Hydra Splatling",
    "Hydra Splatling is derived from Hydra, a mythological multi-headed water monster, and a portmanteau of Splat and Gatling. Hydra may also be short for Hydrant, since the Hydra Splatling is based on a fire hydrant in design.",
    "ハイドラント Haidoranto is derived from Hydrant and refers to a fire hydrant.",
