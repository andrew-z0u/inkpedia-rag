    "The Hero Splatling Replica is a main weapon in Splatoon 2.",
    "It is capable of firing bursts of ink with long range, low damage, and a fast fire rate. Although relatively slow to charge, each ink bullet does enough damage to splat opponents in four hits.",
    "The Hero Splatling Replica is identical in appearance to the Level 1 Hero Splatling. It is mainly silver with a yellow handle and yellow at the ends of the barrels.",
    "The Hero Splatling Replica is visually identical to the Level 1 Hero Splatling, but is simply a re-skinned Heavy Splatling. Therefore, unlike the switchable sub weapons of the Hero Splatling, it comes with Sprinklers and the Sting Ray. To unlock the Hero Splatling Replica, the player must complete every level with the Hero Splatling in Octo Canyon, at which point it becomes available for purchase at Ammo Knights.",

    "The Hero Splatling Replica is a custom design of the standard Heavy Splatling model with the same stats and setup. I'd been carrying out extensive tests and had finally created a weapon with stats worthy of something truly legendary... Sadly, I couldn't get approval for mass production as the guys down there couldn't wrap their heads around my advanced schematics... So I slapped some leftover parts on a Heavy Splatling and here we are! Looks pretty awesome, huh?",
