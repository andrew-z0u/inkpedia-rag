    "The Heavy Splatling is a main weapon in the Splatoon series, produced by Deco.",
    "It is capable of firing bursts of ink with long range, low damage, and a fast fire rate. Although relatively slow to charge, each ink bullet does enough damage to splat opponents in four hits.",
    "The Heavy Splatling varies in appearance between games. In Splatoon, the Heavy Splatling consists of multiple black barrels with orange supports connected to a large water jug that changes color to match the user's ink. In Splatoon 2, the barrels are less blocky, the supports are yellow, and the water jug is at a diagonal angle instead of being completely horizontal. In Splatoon 3, the supports are pink and gray, and a support was added to the water jug.",
    "The Heavy Splatling was made available with the 2.0.0 update on 6 August 2015 at 02:00 UTC.[1] Its set consists of Splash Wall and Inkstrike.",
    "[2]",
    "The Heavy Splatling is kind of similar to a charger, but it belongs to a whole new weapon class! Hold  to pressurize the ink, and then release it to splatterize your foes like DAKKADAKKADAKKADAKKA!! But it uses a lot of ink and takes a while to charge, so this weapon can leave you exposed. Using the Splash Wall to impede your foes before unleashing an Inkstrike can be rather effective!(NA)",
    "The Heavy Splatling returns in Splatoon 2 with a new design, the main differences being a tilted drum and it being primarily yellow instead of orange.[3] Its set consists of Sprinkler and Sting Ray.",
    "It appears in three Octo Expansion stations:",
    "[4]",
    "The mechanics of the Heavy Splatling are similar to those of a charger, but it's in a weapon class of its own! Hold down  to compress your ink, and then release  to unleash a fat stream of ink! Each charge uses a huge amount of ink, and charging it leaves you exposed for a while. If you use the Sprinkler well, you can keep a route open as you prepare to deal a death blow with the Sting Ray! This Splatling cannon's power will make even charger users jealous!",
    "The Heavy Splatling returns in Splatoon 3 with a slightly updated design, with its primary color being changed to pink. Its set consists of Sprinkler and Wave Breaker.",
    "It appears in two missions in Return of the Mammalians:",
    "[5]",
    "The mechanics of the Heavy Splatling are similar to those of a charger, but it's in a weapon class of its own! Hold down  to compress your ink, and then release  to unleash a monster stream! Now, as you might expect, each charge takes a while to get ready and uses a huge amount of ink, leaving you wide-open while you wait. That's why the Sprinkler is a great sub weapon here. It'll help your turf stay inked and keep a little distance between you and your enemies. The pro move is to fire up your Wave Breaker to expose enemy locations while the Heavy Splatling charges up. Then it's open season from way downtown! With power like this, even enemies with chargers will be jelly!",

    "Heavy Splatling is derived from the adjective Heavy and a portmanteau of Splat and Gatling.",
    "バレルスピナー bareru supinā is derived from Barrel and Spinner. The name Barrel Spinner is because the barrels of the Heavy Splatling rotate while charging and firing.",
