    "The Mini Splatling is a main weapon in the Splatoon series.",
    "It has a very short charge time, needing approximately 0.33 seconds to reach the first level of charge, and 0.5 seconds to reach the second level of charge. It has more maneuverability than the Heavy Splatling. However, its range is significantly shorter than the Heavy Splatling, with a lower firing duration, only shooting for 0.6 seconds at the first level of charge and 1.2 seconds at the second level of charge. Each fully charged attack consumes 15% of the ink tank capacity, allowing users to fire six full charges before needing to refill. Each ink bullet deals enough damage to splat opponents in four hits.",
    "The appearance of the Mini Splatling vastly differs between games. In Splatoon, the Mini Splatling has a green handle and multiple red barrels that are held together with dark green supports. The ink tank is below the gun and the two connect via a red tube. In Splatoon 2, the Mini Splatling retains the same general structure, but the ink tank is more to the side of the gun than below it. In Splatoon 2, the handle is purple, the barrels are white, and the supports are blue. In both games, the ink tank changes color to match the user's ink. In Splatoon 3, some of the supports are yellow and the handle and other supports are purple, and the tank resembles the body of the Splattershot.",
    "The Mini Splatling was released on 5 September 2015 at 02:00 UTC.[1][2] It comes with Suction Bombs and the Inkzooka.",
    "[3]",
    "\"The Mini Splatling is a Splatling cannon with a short charge time and easy handling. Using the Suction Bombs skillfully will allow you to pressure the enemy from right on the front lines! Making a decisive assault with a fully charged Inkzooka is another effective route to victory!(NA)",
    "\"The Mini Splatling is a Splatling with an improved mechanism, resulting in much quicker charge times. Using the Suction Bombs skilfully will allow you to pressure the enemy from right on the front lines! Then once you've charged your Special Gauge, go on an all-out offensive with the help of the Inkzooka.(EU/OC)",
    "The Mini Splatling returns in Splatoon 2 with Burst Bombs and Tenta Missiles.",
    "It appears in two Octo Expansion stations:",
    "[4]",
    "The Mini Splatling has a reduced charge time thanks to a revision to the firing mechanism! You can also use Burst Bombs to paint the walls, making for a more three-dimensional battlefield! With the included Tenta Missiles you can rain down splattage from above. This is a great set for leaders who want to set the pace of battle.",
    "Door een wijziging van het afvuurmechanisme laadt de Mini-Spletling sneller op dan andere wapens van dezelfde klasse! Gebruik een Ballonbom om de muren te verven en het slagveld driedimensionaal te maken! En laat het inkt regenen met de Spetterraketten! Vecht slim en leid je team naar de overwinning! (NL/B)",
    "The Mini Splatling returns in Splatoon 3 with Burst Bombs and Ultra Stamp as its kit.",
    "It appears in two missions in Return of the Mammalians:",
    "[5]",
    "Ooo, let me tell you all about the new and improved Mini Splatling. Thanks to a few revisions with the firing mechanism, it charges more quickly than ever! This loadout also comes with Burst Bombs, which are excellent for inking walls, allowing you to get vertical in a hurry when the situation demands it. And speaking of situational strategy, with the Ultra Stamp as your special, you can push the front line at the drop of a splat. Try this set out if you fancy yourself a field general!",

    "Mini Splatling is derived from Mini, and a portmanteau of Splat and Gatling.",
    "スプラスピナー Supura Supinā is a combination of either Splat or Splash, and Spinner. Spinner is due to the fact that the barrels of the Mini Splatling rotate while charging and firing.",
