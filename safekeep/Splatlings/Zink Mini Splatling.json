    "The Zink Mini Splatling is a main weapon in the Splatoon series. It is a Mini Splatling with Zink branding and a different loadout.",
    "It has a very short charge time, needing approximately 0.33 seconds to reach the first level of charge, and 0.5 seconds to reach the second level of charge. It has more maneuverability than the Heavy Splatling. However, its range is significantly shorter than the Heavy Splatling, with a lower firing duration, only shooting for 0.6 seconds at the first level of charge and 1.2 seconds at the second level of charge. Each fully charged attack consumes 15% of the ink tank capacity, allowing users to fire six full charges before needing to refill. Each ink bullet deals enough damage to splat opponents in four hits.",
    "The Zink Mini Splatling's appearance in each game is based on the default Mini Splatling variant from the same game with an added Zink branding.",
    "In Splatoon, the sticker of Zink's logo is pasted on the right side of the gun's ink tank, the splatling is green and orange, the frame is light green, and the ink tank is white by default.",
    "In Splatoon 2, tape strips with Zink's branding wraps the gun's barrel supports. The splatling is purple and pink. The tape wrapped around the weapon is yellow and blue to match Zink's Splatoon 2 logo. The ink tank is still white by default.",
    "In Splatoon 3, the gun's purple-and-yellow color scheme is changed to Zink's blue-and-white, as well as dark teal. The barrel support also bears Zink's white wordmark. The ink tank is still white by default.",
    "The Zink Mini Splatling was released on 12 December 2015 at  02:00 UTC.[1][2][3] It comes with Disruptors and the Bubbler.",
    "[4]",
    "The Zink Mini Splatling combines the well-balanced Mini Splatling with new sub and special weapons. Launching Disruptors from just behind the front lines can really mess with your opponents' game plan! Share the Bubbler with nearby allies, and you'll be able to sweep forward and steal some turf!(NA)",

Launching Disruptors from just behind the front line can really mess with your opponents' gameplan!

    "The Zink Mini Splatling was released on 24 March 2018 at  02:00 UTC.[5]. It comes with Curling Bombs and the Ink Storm.",
    "[6]",
    "The Zink Mini Splatling stands out amongst other splatlings with its different look, though its stats are the same as the Mini Splatling. If you swim in the wake of the included Curling Bombs, you can quickly reach the front lines and get to work! Ink up your side of the map with a good Ink Storm, laying the groundwork for your team to zip around the map and seize victory!",
    "The Zink Mini Splatling returns in Splatoon 3 with a new design. Its kit is Toxic Mist and Big Bubbler. It was first shown in the Chill Season 2022 announcement trailer on 14 November 2022. It released on 1 December 2022 along with the release of the season.",
    "[7]",
    "The Zink Mini Splatling stands out with a fancy new look and an updated suite of complementary weapons, although its performance is identical to the original Mini Splatling. First of all, we now have the Toxic Mist sub weapon to slow enemies down. Slow enemies make for good targets, so you're less likely to \"mist\" them with the Mini Splatling! Another good strategy with this loadout is to fire up the Big Bubbler and take cover while you're charging. Then you can burst forward, ready to launch an offensive! If you're new to splatlings, this set is user-friendly and ready to rock. Give it a try!",
    "For competitive tips about the Zink Mini Splatling",
    "Zink Mini Splatling is derived from Mini, a shortening of miniature, and a portmanteau of Splat and Gatling. It has the Zink brand name as a prefix to differentiate it from the Mini Splatling. It also denotes that the weapon is a collaboration with Zink.",
    "スプラスピナーコラボ Supura Supinā Korabo is a combination of either Splat or Splash, and Spinner. Spinner is due to the fact that the barrels of the Mini Splatling rotate while charging and firing. It also has the abbreviated prefix Collab to separate it from Splaspinner and to denote that it is a collaboration. However, unlike the English name, it does not specify the brand Zink.",
