    "Both the Mint Decavitator and the Charcoal Decavitator debuted as the third series of the splatana class in Sizzle Season 2024 of Splatoon 3. Compared to the Splatana Stamper, the Mint Decavitator trades vertical slashes, some range, and a little strafe speed for higher damage, wider hitboxes, and longer lunge distance, making this weapon feared and versatile in the hands of an expert wielder.[1][2][3]",
    "The Mint Decavitator has a weapon set that enhances its user's ability to control and deny space, from the main weapon's wide one-hit-splat hitbox and great sharking potential, to the Suction Bomb's large blast radius, to the protective qualities of the Big Bubbler.",
    "While its one-hit-splatting potential, decent range, and Big Bubbler make the Mint Decavitator primarily a great slayer and skirmisher, its decent turfing and Suction Bombs allow it to sometimes play supportively:[1][2][3][5][6]",
    "The Mint Decavitator has two glaring weaknesses:[1][2][5]",
    "Compared to Splat Bombs, Suction Bombs trade rolling and shorter detonation time for attachment to surfaces and a larger blast radius:[9]",
    "If placed carefully, the Big Bubbler can control and deny the opponent space and extend pushes:[1][3][12][13][14][15]",
    "A Mint Decavitator user provides many pieces of a successful team composition: one-hit-splatting potential, combo synergy, high object damage, medium range, decent turfing, a lethal bomb, and a special weapon capable of holding turf and sustaining fights. However, their teammates' weapons will have to address the Mint Decavitator's inability to contest opponents on higher ground, as well as provide an entry special weapon or two, including Tacticooler:[1][2][3][5][6]",
    "An opposing Mint Decavitator user can pose a serious threat through their damage (one-hit splats, combos, object damage), spatial control, and ability to extend and sustain fights. While removing them will not be an easy task, they have a few weaknesses that could be exploited under the right circumstances:[1][2][5]",
    "Like other splatana users, a Mint Decavitator user generally favors abilities that promote an aggressive playstyle, particularly those that enable them to return to and remain on the frontlines to contest and maintain space.[16][17][18]",
    "A Mint Decavitator user's role of pursuing opponents and contesting territory puts them at a higher risk of getting splatted compared to their less aggressive teammates. Comeback provides one primary ability or main, equal to 10 ability points (AP), each of six different gear abilities:",
    "Every player is expected to come in contact with opposing ink on many surfaces, which can both be damaging and reduce mobility. Ink Resistance Up delays the time when damage is taken from contact with opposing ink and partially offsets the reduction in mobility, the latter trait being important whether pursuing or fleeing opponents.",
    "The Mint Decavitator's low ink efficiency prevents its user from either using their Suction Bombs often or firing many slashes after throwing one. Reducing the ink consumption per slash will reduce their downtime:",
    "Aggressively pursuing opponents and contesting territory puts a Mint Decavitator user at higher risk of getting splatted than most other players. Quick Respawn shortens respawn time after getting splatted under specific conditions:",
    "After respawning, a Mint Decavitator user usually would like to quickly return to the front lines to maintain pressure on their opponents. Quick Super Jump shortens the lag time at the start of performing a Super Jump, not only hastening their return to the action but also increasing their likelihood of escaping whenever they need to retreat.",
    "The aggressive playstyle of a typical Mint Decavitator user puts them at high risk of getting splatted, which costs special gauge. A valuable utility sub for many aggressive weapon users, Special Saver reduces the amount of special gauge lost upon getting splatted, allowing a Mint Decavitator user to have Big Bubbler ready sooner:",
    "An essential ability for most players, Stealth Jump better covers the Super Jump landing marker from distant opponents, allowing a Mint Decavitator user to more safely return to the front lines and continue to challenge opponents and contest space.",
    "Opponents often use bombs to either poke at Mint Decavitator users or keep them away. Sub Resistance Up reduces the damage taken from splash damage (but not direct hits) by lethal bombs and both direct hits and splash damage by nonlethal bombs, such as Burst Bombs:",
    "To maintain pressure on their opponents, a Mint Decavitator user can increase their mobility with Swim Speed Up, which both enables them to more quickly pursue their targets–particularly longer-ranged opponents who attempt to zone them out–and makes them harder for opponents to hit:",
    "Upon its arrival in Sizzle Season 2024, the Mint Decavitator was praised for its long lunge slash, large hitbox, and decent turfing but critiqued for its weakness against higher ground, lag during attacks, shorter range than other mid-ranged weapons, and high ink consumption. Big Bubbler was still viewed in the western competitive scene primarily as a counter to Trizooka (a trait that would get better in version 8.1.0) and not much more, so the Charcoal variant (with Inkjet) was considered slightly better at the time. Nevertheless, the novelty of the weapon gave it the potential to become better as more players mastered its unique mechanics. This began as players started to notice the Big Bubbler's value in helping teams using a mobility-based, or dive, composition stall out fights and maintain momentum during pushes. The Mint Decavitator's large hitbox enabled its user to singlehandedly control the space occupied by its Big Bubbler better than any other weapon besides the Splat Roller, giving it a niche in particular team compositions.[19][20][21]",
    "This ability to hold space, along with nerfs to other mid-ranged weapons in version 9.0.0, helped the Mint Decavitator climb up tier lists. It began to be seen as a flexible compromise between the Splat Roller (and its short-ranged, one-hit-splat) and the Splatana Stamper (and its mid-ranged combos), giving it the tools to work in team compositions besides dive compositions. By version 10.0.0, Mint Decavitator was considered a top 10–if not a top 5–weapon, particularly as compositions began to include more aggressive support and utility weapons.[1][2][3][6]",

    "- Its tap slash (tap ) is reasonably quick and launches wide projectiles with good damage. Use tap slashes with other attacks (both yours and your teammates') in combos, to zone out mobile opponents (such as some splatlings, dualies, and the REEF-LUX) on open terrain, or to turf when farming Big Bubbler or contesting a Splat Zone.",
    "- Its charged slash (charge  for 20 frames, release) is powerful (the melee hit being a one-hit-splat) and releases wider projectiles that have longer range than those of the tap slash (exceeding that of the .96 Gal) but has very high ink consumption and a slower swing than that of the Splatana Stamper.\nBoth the charged slash and tap slash can form combos with each other and with many other weapons—even those with lower damage per hit, such as the Splash-o-matic and the Dualie Squelchers (both 28 HP).[7]\nShort-hopping (tap ) while charging an attack improves one's mobility while preventing the end-lag of full jumps.\nSimilar to chargers, splatlings, and stringers, charging behind cover before peeking around it reduces your exposure to opponents' attacks and gives them less time to react.\nLunging on the ground (hold  upon releasing ) can quickly close the distance between you and your opponent. The Mint Decavitator has a longer lunge than that of the Splatana Stamper, allowing its user to attack across short gaps[8] and shark at further distances than usual.\nFlicking either  or the controller after the lunge begins can change its direction, enabling more movement options:\nCombining lunge flicking with charging behind cover enables you to attack opponents from around corners or behind cover.\nLunge flicking enables your to either flee an aggressive opponent or dodge their attacks while still firing back. If the charged slash hits, a tap slash will finish them off.",
    "- Even without Object Shredder, its object damage is very high (HTD: hits to destroy):[4]",
    "- Both the charged slash and tap slash can form combos with each other and with many other weapons—even those with lower damage per hit, such as the Splash-o-matic and the Dualie Squelchers (both 28 HP).[7]",

    "- Lunge flicking enables your to either flee an aggressive opponent or dodge their attacks while still firing back. If the charged slash hits, a tap slash will finish them off.",
    "- The Mint Decavitator's wide charged slashes and Suction Bomb (see below) allow its user to turf thoroughly to take or maintain map control, contest or capture Splat Zones, and farm Big Bubbler.",
    "- Because both tap and charged projectiles travel in a straight line (similar to a charger's shot), they require their user to have line of sight to damage opponents, who could exploit cover (such as the tower's pole) to avoid either projectile's giant hitbox.\nIts greatest weakness is its inability to challenge opponents on higher ground, especially on ledges. Its lack of a vertical slash makes it far less effective at ledge-camping than either a roller or a different splatana. Focus on challenging opponents who are on flat terrain at the same elevation as you.\nConversely, ranged area of effect (AoE) weapons (particularly the Competitive:Range Blaster and S-BLAST) and AoE-like weapons (such as sloshers) can damage a Mint Decavitator user around or behind cover. The Range Blaster and S-BLAST can also directly hit for a one-shot-splat to punish direct assaults.",
    "- Both its charging and high ink consumption (worse than that of the Splatana Stamper) contribute to its long downtime. They also limit the use of Suction Bombs.\nAn opponent's Splash Wall has enough health points to offset the Mint Decavitator's high object damage.[4] In addition to a Splash Wall, the Squeezer has a high DPS, more range than a Mint Decavitator, and enough mobility to avoid charged slashes.",

    "- Attachment to surfaces both allows more room for error when aiming and enables the planting of craftier traps, such as underneath a grate.\nAs long as any portion of the suction is peaking over the edge of a corner or ledge, the explosion can still damage targets just around the edge.",
    "- They take two seconds after attaching to a surface to detonate, making them less reliable for combos than a Splat Bomb. Therefore, throw Suction Bombs earlier than usual when poking at opponents or denying space.",
    "- Both the damage and inking radii are larger than those of a Splat Bomb.",
    "- They can also flush out opposing anchors from perches and clear other critical areas, such as the Tower.[10]",
    "- A Suction Bomb can damage or destroy an opponent's brella shield, Splash Wall, or the Rainmaker shield, while detonating on contact, damaging or splatting any opponents caught within its blast.[11]",
    "- Some opposing special weapons (such as Booyah Bomb and Triple Inkstrike) can defuse any Suction Bombs they touch, so wait out the special weapon before throwing them.",
    "- As long as any portion of the suction is peaking over the edge of a corner or ledge, the explosion can still damage targets just around the edge.",
    "- Planting it around the objective (e.g., either on or in front of a Splat Zone or Tower) or in the opponents' way to the objective can buy time for a successful push:\nA lunge slash can help a Mint Decavitator user set up their Big Bubbler further forward. Just take care not to get splatted by opposing fire before the Bubbler activates.\nPlanting the Big Bubbler so that the generator on top is positioned behind an obstacle can better protect it from opposing fire. Just be mindful of any ceilings above, which can prevent the barrier from reaching full size.\nThe Mint Decavitator's wide hitbox ensures its user that few opponents can enter their Big Bubbler and challenge them, so long as no opponents are flanking or sharking.",
    "- It produces a spherical barrier that blocks all of the opponents' ranged main and sub weapon attacks and some special weapons but not the opponents themselves:\nOpponents using Zipcaster, Ultra Stamp's swing mode, Reefslider, and Kraken Royale can cross the barrier and splat a Big Bubbler user. Reefslider can also instantly destroy a Big Bubbler by running over it.\nA Big Bubbler cannot block the opponents' Booyah Bomb explosion, Wave Breaker shockwaves, Killer Wail 5.1, or Triple Inkstrike, so be aware if the opponent has them.",
    "- Do not hog the Big Bubbler! Remember that your teammates can also benefit from it:\nTeammates within the Big Bubbler, especially splatling users, have less to fear from opposing charger users and some other long-ranged threats, such as Trizookas.\nEven though the Big Bubbler cannot move, it can be placed onto the Tower itself and can move as the Tower moves and clears checkpoints. Note that the durations of special weapons on the Tower are cut in half, so it is best to activate Big Bubbler just before opponents open fire on the Tower.\nPlanting a Big Bubbler in front of an opponents' Rainmaker pedestal (checkpoint or goal) or clam basket better ensures that a teammate can safely bring the objective there.",
    "- The Big Bubbler's launcher also serves as both a Squid Beakon and a temporary shield. If its user or a teammate stands inside of it, they will be immune to direct damage, similar to showering beneath one's own Splash Wall in the original Splatoon. However, splash damage might still be damaging.",

    "- A displacement special weapon (such as Tenta Missiles, Booyah Bomb, or Triple Inkstrike) can scatter opponents, leaving them eaiser pickings for a Mint Decavitator user.",
    "- The very high, nonlethal damage of the Mint Decavitator's charged slash (80 HP) combos with many weaker main weapons' attacks, such as the Dualie Squelchers, making them more viable in a team composition. In turn, the Mint Decavitator user benefits from the Dualie Squelchers user's ability to lure opponents for the former to finish off.[7]",
    "- Thanks to the Mint Decavitator's decent turfing, the utility/support player has both a lower turfing burden and more freedom to play aggressively.",
    "- A Big Bubbler will provide protection for supports and anchors with shorter range compared to chargers (e.g., Heavy Edit Splatling or Rapid Blaster Pro), allowing them to occupy more open areas to contest space.",
    "- Sub Resistance Up reduces the amount of damage taken from any splash damage by Suction Bombs.[16]",
    "- Direct matchups between Mint Decavitator users on opposing teams are determined by each player's skill, positioning, turf control, and the presence of any teammates.",
    "- Whenever possible, try to position yourself on higher ground above an opposing Mint Decavitator user to exploit their inability to contest you there. Just be wary of any Suction Bombs they might throw your way, especially those just peeking over your ledge's edge.[9]",
    "- Whenever possible, use cover to avoid the opposing Mint Decavitator user's line of sight to limit their opportunities to damage you from a distance.\nHowever, avoid cover that an opposing Mint Decavitator user is directly behind since they can lunge around corners for a quick one-hit-splat.\nMedium-range blasters with a one-hit-splat (Range Blaster, S-BLAST) can check both around corners and behind cover, damage an opposing Mint Decavitator user with their splash damage, and punish direct assaults with a one-hit-splat.\nPlayers whose weapon sets enable them to stall out fights with an opposing Mint Decavitator user (e.g., with Splash Wall or evasion) can exploit the latter's low ink efficiency.",
    "- Shorter-ranged weapon users should rely more on flanking and sharking to confront an opposing Mint Decavitator user, but beware of their lunging charged direct slash.",
    "- Long-ranged weapon users (e.g., most chargers) can fire upon an opposing Mint Decavitator user with impunity from afar.",
    "- Preventing an opposing Mint Decavitator user from planting their Big Bubbler in a highly contested space or, short of that, reducing its usefulness, will prevent the opponents from sustaining their pushes:[13]\nThe most effective means of countering a Big Bubbler (besides splatting its user before they can activate it) is forcing its user to activate it in a less valuable location. Watch the HUD regularly to know when an opposing Mint Decavitator user has their Big Bubbler ready.\nCertain special weapons can quickly destroy an opponent's Big Bubbler (e.g., Booyah Bomb, Triple Inkstrike) or force its user to abandon it (e.g., Zipcaster, Reefslider).\nCertain main weapons either have high object damage (e.g., stringers, splatanas) or a very high fire rate (e.g., Heavy Edit Splatling at full charge) and, thus, are better suited at damaging or destroying an opponent's Big Bubbler than others.\nLethal bombs thrown onto an opponent's Big Bubbler can damage both the generator and barrier simultaneously, hastening its destruction.",
