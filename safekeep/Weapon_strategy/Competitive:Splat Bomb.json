    "The Splat Bomb is the first sub weapon to be introduced in the game, alongside the Splattershot Jr. It is a strong offensive and zoning weapon to more than compensate for the first main weapon's weaknesses and is a versatile sub weapon found in a variety of kits, from short-ranged slayer's and support weapons to long-ranged anchor's weapons.",
    "The Splat Bomb is both powerful and versatile:",
    "Lethal bombs – particularly either Splat or Suction Bombs – provide its user's team many advantages over another team that has no lethal bombs in its composition:[6]",
    "A player with Splat Bombs in their weapon's kit – especially one whose main weapon lacks either range or damage – can provide valuable support for any teammate:",
    "- The Splat Bomb's one-second detonation timer begins as soon as it contacts any surface. Therefore, rolling the Splat Bomb like a bowling ball will produce the quickest explosion for instant area denial.[2]\nIf using a long-ranged weapon, such as a Splat Charger or Gold Dynamo Roller, and an opponent gets too close, either dropping a Splat Bomb at your feet or rolling it like a bowling ball can provide time and space to escape.",
    "- The damage an exploding Splat Bomb inflicts onto a target depends on the distance between them:[3]\nTargets within 40 DU – a little under one distance line away in the test range – will receive 180 HP, or health points, of damage — more than enough to splat most opponents.\nTargets between 40 DU and 70 DU – just shy of 1.5 distance lines away – will receive 30 HP of damage, which is sometimes enough to splat weakened opponents.",
    "- When attacking an opponent's position, try to throw Splat Bombs behind the opponent. This more effectively cuts off their potential escape routes.",
    "- Splat Bombs are great at poking at and zoning out opponents during the neutral phase, stalling an opponent's push, or providing cover while fleeing.",
    "- Carefully lobbing a Splat Bomb at an opposing anchor positioned on their snipe will hinder their ability to control space with their range.",
    "- A Splat Bomb can damage or destroy an opponent's brella shield, Splash Wall, or Baller or the Rainmaker shield, while detonating on contact.\nAny opponents caught within the Splat Bomb's explosion will get damaged or splatted.[4]\nIt will also inflate or pop a teammate's bubbles but deflate or diffuse an opponent's bubbles, while still detonating on contact.[5]",
    "- An opponent's Splashdown, Booyah Bomb, or Ultra Stamp will defuse any Splat Bombs it touches, so hold off using them until after their special weapon finishes.",
    "- Using any special weapon also provides a free ink tank refill. For example, a Splattershot Jr. user can throw a bomb or two before and after using Ink Armor.",
    "- If using a long-ranged weapon, such as a Splat Charger or Gold Dynamo Roller, and an opponent gets too close, either dropping a Splat Bomb at your feet or rolling it like a bowling ball can provide time and space to escape.",

    "- It will also inflate or pop a teammate's bubbles but deflate or diffuse an opponent's bubbles, while still detonating on contact.[5]",
    "- Their one-hit-splat offers its user's team chances of instantly gaining a numbers advantage, from which a game-winning push can arise.",
    "- Their lethal explosion provides space for its user's team to either push into an area held by the opponent or stall an opponent's push.",
    "- The turf inked by the resulting explosion contributes to both maintaining map control and building up the special gauge.",
    "- If using a short-ranged main weapon, cooperate with the teammate using primarily Splat Bombs when engaging an opponent: attack from different angles, or force the opponent to come within range of the teammate's weapon.",
    "- When using a longer-ranged weapon–especially a very long-ranged weapon, such as a Splat Charger–use your main weapon more often than Splat Bombs for support fire. However, do not overlook opportunities to use Splat Bombs, particularly when restricting your opponents' movement options.",
    "- If your teammate gets splatted and an opponent is still present, then determine whether you can easily finish them off. If your weapon is either too weak or too short-ranged or if the opponent either is too healthy or has a teammate, then strongly consider retreating instead of risking getting splatted.",
    "- While the lethal damage of the Splat Bomb can only be avoided by dodging, its splash damage can be reduced by equipping Bomb Defense Up DX. Just three ability points, or one sub, offer good utility against Splat Bombs:[7][8][9][10]\nA player who has taken at least 30 HP of damage from the opponent (thus, has no more than 70 HP) will be visible on the opponents' map. Bomb Defense Up DX prevents its user from being exposed by the splash damage of a single Splat Bomb.\nInk Armor will not break due to splash damage from a single bomb whose splash damage normally inflicts 30 HP of damage.[9][10] With Ink Armor still intact, its wearer will only suffer a maximum of 80 HP of damage from a single hit, allowing them to withstand a single powerful attack, such as that from a Splat Charger.",
    "- Be aware of your opponents' locations before using a brella shield, Splash Wall, Baller, or Bubble Blower, as an opponent's Splat Bombs will detonate upon impact with any of these, potentially splatting you or your teammates if caught within their lethal radius.",
    "- When pursuing an opponent whose kit includes a lethal bomb, such as Splat Bombs, be wary of any bombs they might drop while retreating, such as around a corner or after climbing a ledge.",
    "- Certain special weapons – such as Splashdown, Booyah Bomb, and Ultra Stamp – can negate any of the opponents' Splat Bombs.",
    "- A player who has taken at least 30 HP of damage from the opponent (thus, has no more than 70 HP) will be visible on the opponents' map. Bomb Defense Up DX prevents its user from being exposed by the splash damage of a single Splat Bomb.",
    "- Ink Armor will not break due to splash damage from a single bomb whose splash damage normally inflicts 30 HP of damage.[9][10] With Ink Armor still intact, its wearer will only suffer a maximum of 80 HP of damage from a single hit, allowing them to withstand a single powerful attack, such as that from a Splat Charger."
