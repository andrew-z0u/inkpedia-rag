    "The Enperry Splat Dualies are a classic slayer weapon more focused on mobility than splatting power than its cousin, the Tentatek Splattershot.",
    "While the Curling Bomb is not as versatile as other bombs, it still has a variety of uses:",
    "If piloted properly, the Inkjet can pressure opponents – particularly anchors – more directly than most other slayer's special weapons, such as Tenta Missiles:",
    "Gear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.",
    "Unless an Enperry Splat Dualies user is on an extended splatting streak, they can expect to get splatted often. When equipped, Comeback grants 10 ability points of six different stackable abilities for twenty seconds after respawning from getting splatted by an opponent:",
    "Ink Saver (Main) and Swim Speed Up are the most useful for the wielder, allowing them reduce the amount of ink consumed by dodge rolls (9% to 7.77%) and more quickly pursue and pressure the opponent upon returning from spawn. Special Charge Up also allows the wielder to obtain Inkjet faster on respawn.",
    "Quick Respawn shortens respawn time after getting splatted (under specific conditions), encouraging a Enperries user to remain aggressive even after getting splatted.",
    "Super Jumping to a teammate after respawning carries the risk of getting splatted upon landing, due to the appearance of a Super Jump indicator. When equipped, Stealth Jump better covers this indicator from long distance opponents, allowing its user to more safely return to the front lines and maintain pressure on the opponent.",
    "As a short-ranged weapon that excels at flanking, the Enperry Splat Dualies greatly benefits if it is able to swim faster. Swim Speed Up enables its user to more quickly close the distance towards an opponent, more quickly respond to an opponents' push, or even escape unfavorable situations.",
    "Bomb Defense Up DX will not only reduce the damage taken from opposing sub and special weapons that are not one-hit-splat but will also reduce the duration of the tracking effects of certain opponent's sub and special weapons, such as Point Sensors and Ink Mines, allowing the user of this ability to evade detection more easily.",
    "Increases damage to 33.3 with 32 AP. This can be reached with 2 mains and 4 subs.",
    "Makes the Inkjet last longer and slightly increases the splash damage radius of shots.",
    "Not only does this help with strafing during combat, and improves movement, but it also boosts the speed of the Inkjet.",
    "Mainly used to reduce ink consumption for rolls, as they use 7% of the ink tank.",
    "The Enperry Splat Dualies are a slayer-type weapon. They are not as mobility focused in Splatoon 3, due to their special being changed to Triple Splashdown.",
    "The weapon is a four-shot, resulting in a slightly slower splat time than the Splattershot, even in turret mode.",
    "This weapon can utilize its dodge rolls for several things:",
    "Enperries, as well as almost all the Dualies, can generally be countered in two ways:",
    "A less used counter (due to not being available on most competitively viable weapons) would be mobility hindering sub or special weapons, such as Toxic Mist, Ink Mines, Ink Vac, or Splash Wall. (as it can block off potential escape routes.)",
    "Because the Dualies are a very mobile weapon, they may have to make riskier jumps than other weapons may be comfortable with. Because they already have their dodge rolls, it is highly recommended that all Dualie players use Stealth Jump.",
    "Because the Enperries are a slayer, they are likely to be splatted often, making Comeback a very useful ability. When splatted, someone with Comeback equipped will respawn with 10 AP of the following abilities for 20 seconds.",
    "Ink Saver Main and Swim Speed Up are the most beneficial, as they lower the amount of ink consumed by dodge rolls and allow the user to swim back into position quickly.",
    "As a slayer weapon, the Enperries can expect to occasionally not get any result from a fight, meaning that they were splatted without splatting anyone else. This makes Quick Respawn useful, as it allows the user to get back into a fight quicker. At least 10 AP (one main) is recommended.",
    "Because Dualies need to be very mobile and be able to move into positions quickly, at least 2 subs, (or 6 ability points) is recommended. This is more of a utility than a requirement.",

    "- Compared to the Tentatek Splattershot, the Enperry Splat Dualies are a four-shot splat compared to the Tentatek's three.\nDespite having a slightly higher fire rate, a four-shot splat means that the Tentatek can splat slightly faster than the Enperries.\nThe higher fire rate allows the Enperries to paint better and maintain map control easier, however.",
    "- The Enperries have slightly better strafing speed when firing compared to the Tentatek, at 0.8 DU/f compared to 0.72 DU/f.",
    "- Although the Enperries have better accuracy than the Tentatek, having two reticles makes it more difficult to land shots. Therefore, dodge rolls will be the main method for setting up splats, as the reticles will merge into one and the fire rate will also increase.\nIt is important to note that after dodge rolling twice, the player cannot move for a brief period. Although the user can still shoot, being stuck leaves them open to attack.",
    "- Dodge rolls have other uses as well, such as to quickly escape bombs that other weapons cannot get away from in time.",

    "- When it travels along any inkable non-vertical surface, it leaves a trail of ink behind, providing a quick avenue to either attack or escape.",
    "- Keep opponents guessing by sending Curling Bombs towards the opponent without swimming in its trail. Either Ninja Squid or swimming slowly can help avoid detection while swimming in the ink trail.",
    "- It further assists the main weapon in turfing from a safe distance.",
    "- When charged, or \"cooked\" long enough, it can be used to lay insidious bomb traps to hold off pursuers or flush out sharks.",
    "- Particularly in narrow or closed areas, a Curling Bomb ricocheting off of walls can be a useful distraction to force an opponent to move in a certain direction.",
    "- Upon activation, its launching point is marked for all players – teammates and opponents – to see and, as of version 3.2.0, also indicates when its user will return via Super Jump, allowing an opponent to camp or shark there. Therefore, it is advised to launch the Inkjet from a less visible and better-protected area.\nSince the Enperry Splat Dualies can dodge roll, doing so on landing allows its user to better dodge either a potential Inkjet punish or a simple Super Jump punish, providing a safer landing.\nSpecials are also free ink reloads, allowing the Enperry Splat Dualies user to use a Curling Bomb to potentially escape once the special ends.",
    "- Its movement speed is determined by both the Enperry Splat Dualies' strafing speed and the number of Run Speed Up ability points equipped.",
    "- It is also possible to morph into squid/octopus form and swim in friendly ink while the special is active. This provides some key benefits:\nMorphing will halt the jets to enable the pilot to descend, making them a less predictable target.\nSwimming is faster than flying, enabling an Inkjet pilot to activate the special at a farther distance from opponents and more quickly pursue them.",
    "- Its altitude depends on the elevation of the surface it is hovering above, enabling it to either fly very high over an elevated structure, such as the glass roof in Shellendorf Institute, or hover high enough to challenge an opponent on a perch.\nHowever, the Inkjet cannot achieve thrust off of grates or mesh, causing its pilot to merely walk on them. Avoid hovering over them to maintain altitude.\nPressing the  button will provide a temporary extra thrust. Mastery of both boosting and descending (see above) is necessary for Inkjet pilots to become less predictable for long-ranged opponents to track and pick off.",
    "- Its mobility enables it to reach areas that are otherwise not easily accessible — or even inaccessible, such as over the glass enclosures in Kelp Dome.",
    "- The Inkjet's cannon fires long-ranged, Rainmaker-like bursts of ink that splat opponents in one direct hit or two to four indirect hits:\nLead the Inkjet's shots to compensate for their slightly slower travel speed, especially when positioned farther from an intended target.\nIts splash damage can splat opponents positioned behind obstacles, varying from 30 to 50 damage; the closer the shot to the opponent, the more damage it deals.",
    "- If an Inkjet falls out of bounds, such as into the water, its pilot will land back onto the location of launch — or the most previous point of solid ground. Therefore, the Inkjet can save a player from an out-of-bounds splat in a pinch. You can also use this to your advantage. When being pressured by the enemy team, going into water can save you from being splatted.",

    "- Its splash damage can splat opponents positioned behind obstacles, varying from 30 to 50 damage; the closer the shot to the opponent, the more damage it deals.",
    "- Due to how the Enperry Splat Dualies relies on rolls to set up splats, it will touch enemy ink frequently and take damage. Weapons that use Main Power Up, such as the Kensa Splattershot Pro, Custom Dualie Squelchers, and the Bamboozlers not only have a range advantage, but can splat the Enperries faster than the Enperries can splat them.",
    "- A charger can not only outrange the Enperry Splat Dualies, but can also predict where the Enperries will be after a roll and splat them before they can fire.",

    "- 16 ability points – one main and two subs – increase the swim speed from 1.92 DU/f to 2.14 DU/f.[2]",
    "- 3 ability points - one sub - has a lot of utility and therefore should be ran on any weapon.. This includes, but is not limited to:\nInk Armor will not break due to splash damage from bombs and other explosives that do 30 damage.\nTwo near-misses from Inkjet, two bumps from a Baller, and splash damage from two bubbles from Bubble Blower will not splat the user.\nGetting hit by splash damage from a bomb will not make the user visible on the map.",

    "- The Enperry Splat Dualies are rarely seen in competitive use, due to the main kit, the Splat Dualies, having a better sub and special weapon from a competitive standpoint, as well as the fact that Dualies have not been a major meta weapon at any point in time during Splatoon 3's history.\nThe Curling Bomb is not an outstanding sub for it, with Fizzy Bomb (Now on the Twinklez Splat Dualies) clearly being the better mobility focused sub, and a better fit for the weapon, as it brings combo potential to the table.\nTriple Splashdown is a decent fit for this weapon, especially on lower skill levels, where countering this special is not a common occurrence, but sadly fails to combo with one hit from the weapon, due to the outside hitbox only dealing 60 damage, resulting in 90 total damage.",

    "- To enter turret mode, which causes the user to have an easier time splatting opponents.",
    "- Make up for the lack of range by dodge rolling towards an enemy, instead of painting the ground and swimming in friendly ink.",
    "- Flank or confuse an opponent. This can be done by:\nSquid Rolling and then immediately dodge rolling to the starting point; which can result in tripping up the opponent.\nUsing one dodge roll to put the user in immediate view of an enemy, then dodge roll back behind cover. This can confuse the opponent, and if done quickly enough, make the opponent question if you were even there.\nHave an opponent chase the user, then dodge roll behind cover. The user should then splat them as they pass (or directly approach) them by using turret mode to splat them quickly.\nA well set up Curling Bomb can help a user escape if this fails.",

    "- Using the dodge roll endlag to swim into a dead zone, where a Dualie user would have to turn their camera by almost ninety degrees to hit the attacker. This puts the Dualie user at a disadvantage, and allows the player a better chance to splat the Dualie.\nA good motion control (or most stick control) user can counter this, ending with the Dualie user getting the splat instead.",
    "- Long range weapons such as most Splatlings and Chargers, or even specials like Inkjet and Crab Tank, can abuse the Enperries' lack of range, even with the two dodge rolls.\nThis is another reason why Enperries do not see much competitive use, due to Splatoon 3's map design being massively favored towards long range options (and a few mid range options) like the Splattershot Pro or Snipewriter.",
