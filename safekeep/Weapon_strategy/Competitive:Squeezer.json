    "When placed properly, a Splash Wall can provide great utility, even in stages and areas that are more open:",
    "The Sting Ray is an infinitely long distance weapon that can penetrate obstacles and damage opponents from afar:",
    "Gear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.",
    "Increases semiautomatic mode damage up to 49.4.",
    "Increases Sting Ray Duration.",
    "Like in Splatoon 2, all the above applies, however Squeezer can take on more aggressive positions thanks to its less backline oriented playstyle because of its special Trizooka.\nSqueezer now plays similarly to its Foil variant in Splatoon 2; a midline slayer. It can remain at long distances to provide support fire with the main weapon or special to pressure out or splat backline and other longer-ranged offenders like chargers, Jet Squelcher and anchoring splatlings (i.e Heavy Splatling, Ballpoint Splatling, Hydra Splatling).",
    "While one user of a short-ranged weapon such as the N-ZAP '85 might get away with a lack of range, having too many short-ranged weapons on a team without a longer-ranged weapon like Squeezer to provide support fire is often disadvantageous for a number of reasons:[1]",
    "The Squeezer's lack of lethal bombs can also be a liability to a team composition. Lethal bombs – particularly either Splat or Suction Bombs – provide their user's team a couple advantages over another team that has no lethal bombs in its composition:[1]",
    "Trizooka is an integral part of Squeezer's kit. Trizooka's purpose on Squeezer is to splat and/or pressure backlines and other threats, while also providing chip damage for other main weapons. For example, the outside radius of Trizooka, dealing 53 damage, will allow a Slosher, Snipewriter 5H, or .52 Gal to splat an opponent in one hit. Squeezer is able to use Trizooka in positions similar to where it would usually fight due to both the main weapon and special's range, and can also use its Splash Wall as additional cover if it needs to use its special in a more vulnerable area.",
    "Gear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.",
    "Sub Resistance Up will only reduce the damage taken from opposing sub weapons that are not one-hit-splat but will also reduce the duration of the tracking effects of certain opponent's sub and special weapons, such as Point Sensors and Ink Mines, allowing the user of this ability to evade detection more easily.",
    "Using Quick Super Jump allows Squeezer users to more easily return and retreat to or from the battles.",
    "Every player is expected to come in contact with the opponent's ink on various surfaces, which can both inflict damage and reduce mobility. Ink Resistance Up not only partially offsets the reduction in mobility but also delays the damage taken from contact with opposing ink:",
    "The Squeezer is an ink-hungry weapon. When equipped, Last-Ditch Effort grants 24 ability points of three different stackable abilities for the last 30 seconds, or when the ranked score is 50 or below. These abilities include:",
    "Ink Saver (Main) is the most useful for Squeezer, allowing it to reduce the amount of ink consumed while firing the main weapon so it can continually apply mid-range pressure.",
    "Super Jumping to a teammate after respawning carries the risk of getting splatted upon landing, due to the appearance of a Super Jump indicator. When equipped, Stealth Jump better covers this indicator from long distance opponents, allowing its user to more safely return to the front lines and maintain pressure on the opponent.",
    "As a slayer weapon, the Squeezer greatly benefits if it is able to swim faster. Swim Speed Up enables its user to more quickly close the distance towards an opponent, more quickly respond to an opponents' push, or even escape unfavorable situations.",
    "Object Shredder is useful on Squeezer. This ability helps to destroy barriers such as the Big Bubbler and Rainmaker barrier or to break some special weapons including the Crab Tank and Wave Breaker. This also applies to the Trizooka, which can instantly shred certain HP specials with Object Shredder equipped.",
    "Run Speed is an effective ability for Squeezer. Run Speed increases its mobility and since Squeezer is not too gear dependent, Run Speed makes for a great ability as it can be used to close the gap between you and your target.",
    "Haunt is useful for calling out enemy positions, especially when the enemy that splatted the Squeezer user is behind cover. However, Haunt's Respawn Punisher effect is negated by Tacticooler, and in the positions Squeezer fights in, it may struggle to activate the location ability, since getting too close to an enemy will hide their outline.",
    "Not recommended. Tacticooler, an extremely prevalent special in the metagame, completely negates the effects of Respawn Punisher. In addition, Squeezer cannot reliably get splats from positions that do not leave it vulnerable to attack by other midrange weapons, or anchor weapons - meaning when it does get splatted, it will lose most of its special.",

Less importantly, damage per shot of the fully automatic mode maxes out to 33.3 at 20 ability points — or two mains.\nThe fully automatic mode is short ranged and loses accuracy the longer it is fired but is more efficient at turfing than the semiautomatic mode.",
    "- The Squeezer has two main weakness: low ink efficiency and slow firing rate:\nIts ink efficiency is worse than that of the Splattershot Pro. Always check the ink tank and avoid getting caught in the middle of opposing ink.\nIts slow firing rate can be exploited by quicker firing slayer's weapons that get too close, so keep an eye out for both flankers and sharks.\nA less notable weakness is its turfing, particularly when compared to other support weapons. In general, focus more on splatting opposing support players instead of trying to out-turf them with a slower firing, less ink efficient weapon.",

    "- A Splash Wall can nullify a brella shield — even a Tenta Brella shield.\nIf an opposing Brella user launches their shield, dropping a Splash Wall in front of it will cause both to negate one another, potentially denying a Rainmaker or Power Clam push.\nAt maximum, it takes 36-41% of the ink tank to launch a Brella shield and 60% to drop a Splash Wall. However, the Splash Wall can be deployed far more quickly, allowing its owner more time to reload ink or reposition themselves to a more favorable location.",

    "- The Squeezer has the lowest special gauge requirement (180p) among all other Sting Ray-based weapons, along with the Custom Jet Squelcher, and Dynamo Roller. Combined with its solid turfing when holding , a Squeezer user will often have Sting Ray available compared to other Sting Ray-based weapons.",
    "- Before starting the Sting Ray, it is advised to keep a safe distance from battles, as firing a Sting Ray too close to an opponent can leave one vulnerable to attack.",
    "- When firing the Sting Ray, if an opponent escapes from the ray, bring up the map with . An opponent who has taken any damage will be visible on the map until completely healed. Redirect the Sting Ray until the popping sound is heard.",
    "- When fired at certain objectives in Ranked Battle — namely the Tower, the Rainmaker, or an opponent's Power Clam, Sting Ray can help stall the opponents' push. However, it often pays to wait for teammates to be nearby the objective to secure it before firing the Sting Ray.",
    "- While thought of as a defensive, or stalling special weapon, Sting Ray can also be used to great effect on offense:\nRestraining or eliminating opponents who attempt to attack your teammate tasked with the objective (Tower, Rainmaker, Power Clam).\nEliminating or distracting the opposing anchor, preventing them from providing support fire on defense.",
