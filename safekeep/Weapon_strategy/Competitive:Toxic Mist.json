    "Toxic Mist is the Splatoon 2 successor to the Disruptor from the original Splatoon. Like the Disruptor, Toxic Mist can reduce opponents' movement speed and deplete their ink tanks. Unlike the Disruptor, which affects opponents immediately caught within its blast for a set duration, Toxic Mist only affects opponents whenever they are within its fog, which remains on the stage for a brief amount of time. Thus, while its effects usually do not last as long as those of Disruptor, Toxic Mist can dissuade opponents from occupying key areas.",
    "Toxic Mist can limit your opponents' ability to advance, attack, or flee:",
    "Toxic Mist has a few disadvantages, particularly when compared to bombs:[1]",
    "While Toxic Mist can discourage opponents from moving through it, it neither prevents them from doing so nor damages them. This makes Toxic Mist less versatile than most bombs, particularly Splat or Suction Bombs, which can be used to poke at the opponents. A team with lethal bombs in its composition has many advantages over another team that has no lethal bombs:[4]",
    "The opponents' Toxic Mist is normally a nuisance but can prove fatal for you in the wrong circumstances.",
    "- Upon contacting a surface, Toxic Mist will form a cloud of fog that remains on the stage for five seconds.",
    "- Opponents caught within its cloud will have their run and swim speed and jump elevation all reduced:[2]\nOpponents wielding heavyweight weapons – including the Explosher, the Tenta Brella, and especially the Rainmaker – are slowed to a crawl and extremely vulnerable to attack if caught in Toxic Mist.\nAs of version 5.2.0 onwards, Toxic Mist can also slow down opponents using a Baller, preventing them from taking over space.\nThrowing it in front of the opponents' positions can either slow their offensive rush or prevent them from quickly reacting on defense. Users of long-ranged weapons, such as the Jet Squelcher and the Bamboozler 14 Mk II, benefit from this tactic to keep their shorter-ranged opponents a safe distance away.\nToxic Mist can temporarily prevent usage of routes in Rainmaker that require a long jump across a gap. For example, at Sturgeon Shipyard, if the defense throws Toxic Mist onto the block just next to its Ramp, an opposing Rainmaker carrier will not be able to make the jump from their to the Defense's Spools until the Mist dissipates.",
    "- Toxic Mist drains an opponent's ink tank at an exponential rate, completely depleting a full tank in about 8 seconds and 21 frames.[2]\nInk-guzzling weapons – such as chargers, splatlings, sloshers, and most blasters – are most affected by its ink tank-draining effects. Note that the Rainmaker does not depend on its wielder's ink tank and can still fire shots while within a Toxic Mist.\nStarting from version 4.2.0, opposing dualie users will have to spend 3.5 times the usual amount of ink to perform a dodge roll, reducing their ability to strafe, rush forward, or zone out targets.",
    "- When an opponent is caught in Toxic Mist, a distinct sound will be heard, and they will be covered in your team's colored mist..[3]",
    "- The effects of Toxic Mist do not stack, so an opponent within two clouds of Mist will not be slowed down any further or lose their ink any faster.",
    "- Opponents wielding heavyweight weapons – including the Explosher, the Tenta Brella, and especially the Rainmaker – are slowed to a crawl and extremely vulnerable to attack if caught in Toxic Mist.",

    "- It can neither damage opponents nor fully halt their movement. Users of short-ranged weapons, such as the Splash-o-matic, will lack the ability to zone out or poke at opponents or deny space.",
    "- It also does not turf surfaces, meaning that it cannot contribute to map control.",
    "- Their one-hit-splat offers its user's team chances of instantly gaining a numbers advantage, from which a game-winning push can arise.",
    "- Their lethal explosion provides space for its user's team to either push into an area held by the opponent or stall an opponent's push.",
    "- The turf inked by the resulting explosion contributes to both maintaining map control and building up the special gauge.",
    "- If an opponent throws Toxic Mist your way, move just enough to remain outside of its cloud. As long as you are outside of the cloud, you will not be affected.",
    "- While neither Run Speed Up nor Swim Speed Up can completely nullify the effects of Toxic Mist, they can make it easier to travel through an opponent's Mist.",
    "- Sometimes, it is possible to wait out an opponent's Toxic Mist. If a shorter-ranged opponent persists in throwing their Mist, then use your range or sub weapons to force them back."
