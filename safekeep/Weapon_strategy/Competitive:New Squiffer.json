    "Like the Classic Squiffer, the New Squiffer trades some range and damage for a shorter charge time and more ink efficiency than the Splat Charger. Compared to the Vanilla variant, its kit offers better survivability with a bomb for defense in close-quarters combat and a Baller for added personal protection.[3][4]",
    "Like the rest of the Squiffer series, the New Squiffer can flex between a slayer and an anchor's weapon:",
    "The New Squiffer has a couple weaknesses:",
    "While not always as reliable as some other bombs (partly due to having a smaller explosion radius), Autobombs can still be used in a similar fashion and have some unique utility:",
    "The Baller provides its user an extra layer of protection:",
    "The New Squiffer's range and one-shot splat potential allow its user to maintain spatial control and pressure without having to thoroughly ink large swaths of turf. However, its requirement to charge before firing leaves its user vulnerable at close range. Therefore, it is generally advised not to add more than one other long-ranged weapon to a team composition for a few reasons:[11]",
    "While quicker and more efficient at turfing than most other chargers, the New Squiffer still turfs less efficiently than many typical slayer weapons, such as the Splash-o-matic and the Splattershot. A team whose composition lacks sufficient turfing ability will struggle to maintain map control, which can make games seem like a constant uphill battle:[11]",
    "While Autobombs technically count as a lethal bomb, they are noticeably easier to avoid. Due to this, make sure that at least one teammate has more reliable bombs (particularly either Splat or Suction Bombs), as they provide its user's team many advantages over another team that has no reliable lethal bombs in its composition:[11]",
    "Given the New Squiffer's unique set of strengths and weaknesses, its user will benefit from having teammates with mobile, short-ranged weapons; quick-turfing weapons; and lethal bombs:[12]",
    "A skilled, opposing New Squiffer user is a threat from distance, beneath a ledge, and around a corner. Splatting them will temporarily remove their ranged pressure for their team.",
    "Gear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.",
    "Ever since its introduction in version 4.3.0, Bomb Defense Up DX will not only reduce the damage taken from opposing sub and special weapons that are not one-hit-splat but will also reduce the duration of the tracking effects of certain opponent's sub and special weapons, such as Point Sensors and Ink Mines, allowing the user of this ability to evade detection more easily. While this is a useful ability for any player, a New Squiffer user would want it to reduce the splash damage taken from bombs, Tenta Missiles, and Inkjet shots. Just three ability points, or one sub, offer a great amount of utility:[13][14][15][16]",
    "Every player, especially a New Squiffer user who swims while storing a charge, is expected to come in contact with the opponent's ink on various surfaces, which can both be damaging and reduce mobility. Ink Resistance Up not only partially offsets the reduction in mobility but also delays the damage taken from contact with opposing ink:[13][15]",
    "[17]",
    "Main Power Up enhances the performance of the New Squiffer in two areas:[7][13][14]",
    "Each of these benefits respectively improve the main weapon's capability to snipe further targets and turf quickly. Of the 284 New Squiffer builds submitted to Sendou.ink, over 45% of them have between 19 and 32 ability points of Main Power Up:[18]",
    "[17]",
    "Quick Super Jump decreases both the \"charge\" time before and the travel time of a Super Jump, helping its user escape unfavorable situations more quickly. A New Squiffer user tends to be vulnerable in close-quarters combat and would prefer to quickly retreat and preserve precious special gauge progress for Ink Armor, which can prevent a disadvantageous situation from becoming a losing one.[13][15]",
    "A universally valuable ability for almost any weapon, Swim Speed Up is particularly useful for a New Squiffer user, who often swims while storing a charged shot. Swimming faster enables one to both more easily close the distance between themselves and a longer-ranged opponent and maintain enough distance between themselves and a shorter-ranged opponent.[13]",
    "[19]",
    "- Like most other chargers, it can fire three different types of shots that vary in charge time, base range from the muzzle, and damage:",
    "- In general, use tap shots for turfing, partially charged shots for close quarters combat, and fully charged shots for sniping.",
    "- Like most other chargers without a scope, the New Squiffer can store a full charge while submerged in ink, providing its user more mobility and making left-side peeking more viable in Splatoon 2.[6]",
    "- Unique to the Squiffer series is the ability to charge a shot at full speed while in midair, allowing a Squiffer user to snipe at opponents from underneath a short ledge — a position more associated with slayers.[1][3][4]",
    "- It has the shortest range among all chargers — 167.65 DU versus the Bamboozler's 195.64 DU and the Splat Charger's 240.37 DU. Not only does this put the New Squiffer at a disadvantage against other chargers and other longer-ranged weapons (e.g., versus the Jet Squelcher at 212.64 DU), but it also leaves less room for error when sniping against opposing shorter-ranged weapon users.[1] Fortunately, its range – along with its turfing – can be increased to exceed the minimum range of a Heavy Splatling (178.05 DU) with a reasonable amount of Main Power Up.[5][7]",
    "- While not as immobile or slow-charging as most other chargers, the New Squiffer is still poor at close range compared to a rapid-firing weapon. Keep your distance from opponents and always watch for any flanking attempts by the opposing team.",
    "- Their tracking capability allows them to reveal sharking opponents and both distract and flush out opponents from important areas, such as a perch or the Tower.\nThey are particularly effective when thrown at opposing users of slower weapons, such as an E-liter 4K or Dynamo Roller, as it is more difficult for them to move out of the way.[8]\nNote that throwing Autobombs onto the Tower is slightly more difficult since it bounces off walls easily when thrown — including the pole on the Tower. Aim for the space on the side when throwing them.",
    "- They can also be used to poke at and zone out opponents during the neutral phase, stall an opponent's push, or provide space to escape.",
    "- An Autobomb can damage or destroy an opponent's brella shield, Splash Wall, or Baller or the Rainmaker shield, while detonating on contact.\nAny opponents caught within the Autobomb's explosion will get damaged or splatted.[9]\nIt will also inflate or pop a teammate's bubbles but deflate or diffuse an opponent's bubbles, while still detonating on contact.[10]",
    "- An opponent's Splashdown, Booyah Bomb, or Ultra Stamp will defuse any Autobombs it touches, so hold off using them until after their special weapon finishes.",
    "- They are particularly effective when thrown at opposing users of slower weapons, such as an E-liter 4K or Dynamo Roller, as it is more difficult for them to move out of the way.[8]",

    "- It will also inflate or pop a teammate's bubbles but deflate or diffuse an opponent's bubbles, while still detonating on contact.[10]",
    "- In general, activate the Baller in a relatively safe place before taking enemy fire, as its startup delay – similar to that of the Bubbler in Splatoon – will deny its user protection if activated too late.",
    "- The Baller cannot travel through grates or mesh that a morphed Inkling or Octoling can swim through, such as the gate leading to the court on Goby Arena. Keep this in mind when either pursuing or escaping an opponent while using Baller.",
    "- Since version 5.2.0, opponents' Toxic Mist will slow down players using Baller.",
    "- Taking control of a certain area of the stage, such as a Splat Zone or underneath the opponents' Clam basket.",
    "- Forcing the opponents to clear an area, whether leading a Tower or Rainmaker push or stopping one.",
    "- Providing its user an extra layer of protection, such as when fleeing an unsafe situation or while riding the Tower at a checkpoint. In the latter case, be wary of getting knocked off of the Tower by the opponents' weapons.",
    "- After the Baller's explosion, nearby opponents not splatted are often damaged enough for one or two hits from either the main or sub weapon to splat them.",
    "- Baller can be used to survive a Splashdown, although the Baller is instantly destroyed.",
    "- A team with too many long-ranged weapons will have fewer mobile weapons that can quickly capture turf and wrest control of the objective, hindering its ability to begin an effective push into the opponents' territory. Such a team will also have difficulty breaking out of an opponent's spawn camp.",
    "- Longer-ranged weapons, such as the Foil Squeezer, are generally less effective at close range, so a team with too many of them is more prone to getting flanked and sharked than usual.",
    "- A team whose composition lacks enough turfing ability can be rendered immobile if the other team dominates map control.",
    "- A lack of turfing also makes it difficult to alter the course of a game, even after wiping out the other team.",
    "- Their one-hit-splat offers its user's team chances of instantly gaining a numbers advantage, from which a game-winning push can arise.",
    "- Their lethal explosion provides space for its user's team to either push into an area held by the opponent or stall an opponent's push.",
    "- The turf inked by the resulting explosion contributes to both maintaining map control and building up the special gauge.",
    "- The Neo Splash-o-matic, the Kensa Splattershot, and the L-3 Nozzlenose D are just a few slayer's weapons whose users can be of benefit to a New Squiffer user. They all turf well, and have bombs included in their kits.",
    "- Having a second support player team up with a New Squiffer user can be valuable if the former is good at turfing and has bombs. These weapons can include the Aerospray MG, the N-ZAP '85 or '89, and the Mini Splatling.",
    "- Shorter-ranged weapon users should not rush haphazardly at an opposing New Squiffer user — especially if they are fully charged; they will punish those who move predictably.\nInstead, rely on flanking and sharking to get within range and neutralize their range advantage. If they tag you with a point sensor, either briefly keep a distance from opponents to avoid getting splatted or lure them away from the objective or another important area to distract them.\nThrowing bombs or Toxic Mist at an opposing New Squiffer user can briefly force them out of position and throw off their aim. While Toxic Mist does not damage them, it drains their ink tank and limits their movement, making them more vulnerable to a direct assault.",
    "- Longer-ranged weapon users each have to confront an opposing New Squiffer user differently:\nOther chargers, the Bloblobber, the Ballpoint Splatling, and the Hydra Splatling outrange the New Squiffer, and the Jet Squelcher, the Explosher, and the Heavy Splatling also outrange a New Squiffer without Main Power Up. However, an opposing New Squiffer user is more mobile.\nThe Nautilus out-turfs the New Squiffer and is more mobile (due to being able to store a charge longer), but the New Squiffer can splat in one shot and has a longer range.",

    "- The Nautilus out-turfs the New Squiffer and is more mobile (due to being able to store a charge longer), but the New Squiffer can splat in one shot and has a longer range.",
    "- The splash damage of most bombs is reduced from 30 HP to 28.6 HP. This reduction in damage provides two benefits:\nIt prevents its user from being exposed on their opponents' map by the splash damage of most single bombs.\nInk Armor will not break due to splash damage from a single bomb whose splash damage normally inflicts 30 HP of damage.",
    "- The splash damage of near-misses from either Tenta Missiles or Inkjet, the minimum splash damage of bubbles, and the collision damage from Baller are all reduced from 50 HP to 48.3 HP,[14] enabling one to survive two hits from any of these specific means of special weapon damage.",
    "- It prevents its user from being exposed on their opponents' map by the splash damage of most single bombs.",
    "- Ink Armor will not break due to splash damage from a single bomb whose splash damage normally inflicts 30 HP of damage.",
    "- It lengthens the range of fully charged shots by up to 8.95%.",
    "- It increases the New Squiffer's ink coverage by up to 24%.",
    "- Three ability points, or one sub, of Quick Super Jump decreases the \"charge\" time from 80 frames (1.33 seconds) to 58 frames (0.97 seconds).[17]",
    "- Six ability points, or two subs, increase the swim speed from 1.92 DU/f to 2.01 DU/f.",
    "- Ten ability points, or one main, further increase the swim speed to 2.07 DU/f.[17]"
