    "In contrast to the original variant of the Rapid Blaster, which has a supportive kit, the Kensa variant has a kit suited for a slayer, similar to that of the Rapid Blaster Deco. However, the Kensa variant's kit enables it to be a more effective slayer than the Deco variant.",
    "Because blasters are generally poor at turfing, their users will have to rely on their teammates to maintain map control. Not having enough turfing ability – usually from having too many blasters and chargers – presents its own set of problems:[3]",
    "The Kensa Rapid Blaster has great range and decent poking ability, but is vulnerable to being rushed down. Be sure to include some mobile, shorter-ranged weapons in the team composition. Otherwise, a team with too many longer-ranged weapons will have major drawbacks:[3]",
    "Gear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.",
    "Any weapon, including a Kensa Rapid Blaster, can often come in contact with the opponent's ink on various surfaces, which can both be damaging and reduce mobility. Ink Resistance Up not only partially offsets the reduction in mobility but also delays the damage taken from contact with opposing ink:",
    "[4]",
    "Decreases ink usage of Torpedoes (only one may be active at a time).",
    "Increases both accuracy while jumping and explosion radius. While the increased blast radius has a small difference, the increased accuracy is valuable due to the weapon's long range, which allows shots to deviate farther from their intended target.",
    "The Kensa Rapid Blaster has trouble turfing and is vulnerable to being rushed down. Due to this, they can greatly benefit from Swim Speed Up, which enables its user to better maintain an optimal distance from an opponent, more quickly respond to an opponents' push, or even escape unfavorable situations.",

    "- The kit of the Kensa Rapid Blaster allows it to play efficiently as a slayer.\nUse the blast radius to damage opponents hiding around corners, behind obstacles, up ledges, or behind the shield of a brella — fire around instead of at the shield when an opposing brella wielder puts it up. This especially comes in handy when attacking the Tower.\nMain Power Up can enlarge the blast radius, maxing out at 29 ability points.\nLike most blasters, the Kensa Rapid Blaster is both mediocre at turfing and far less ink efficient than other shooters. Keep an eye on the ink tank and avoid getting surrounded by opposing ink. Consider using ink-replenishing or ink-saving abilities, such as Ink Recovery Up, if the ink tank keeps getting low too often.\nBecause of its lack of turfing, mobility will be limited. Rolling Torpedoes and Swim Speed Up can each help either approach or retreat from opponents.",
    "- Torpedoes have a variety of uses, especially a few that minimize the main weapon's weaknesses.\nTorpedoes are a noxious distraction tool, poking at opponents during the neutral phase.\nWhen rolled on the floor or against a wall like a Splat Bomb, a Torpedo will remain in its first stage and explode in a similar fashion, albeit less powerfully. Once its damage (60 direct, 35 splash) is confirmed, immediately follow up with a direct hit from the main weapon (85) to quickly splat an opponent.[2]\nBoth phases of the Torpedo turf more efficiently than the main weapon can, aiding in both mobility and building up the special gauge.\nWhile only one Torpedo may be used at a time, Ink Saver (Sub) can still conserve ink for each use of Torpedo, saving ink for the main weapon.",
    "- The Baller is a versatile special weapon with a variety of uses:\nTaking control of a certain area of the stage, such as a Splat Zone or underneath the opponents' Clam basket.\nForcing the opponents to clear an area, whether leading a Tower or Rainmaker push or stopping one.\nProviding its user an extra layer of protection, such as when fleeing an unsafe situation or while riding the Tower at a checkpoint. In the latter case, be wary of getting knocked off of the Tower by the opponents' weapons.\nAfter the Baller's explosion, nearby opponents not splatted are often damaged enough for one or two hits from either the main or sub weapon to splat them.\nBaller can be used to survive a Splashdown, although the Baller is instantly destroyed.",

    "- Any weapon with a combination of longer range, better mobility, or higher damage output without sacrificing too much mobility or ink efficiency – such as any variants of the Splattershot Pro or the .96 Gal – can counter a Kensa Rapid Blaster. However, be aware of both the splash damage and the Torpedoes.",
    "- Neither variant of the Splat Brella can sufficiently protect from both the splash damage of the Kensa Rapid Blaster and the Torpedo. However, all three variants of the Tenta Brella can provide enough protection.",
    "- Try to exploit the Kensa Rapid Blaster's poor ink efficiency and mediocre turfing by containing it with ink. Sub weapons and teammates can help accomplish this.",
    "- Any long-ranged weapon, such as a charger or most splatlings, can fire with impunity at a Kensa Rapid Blaster as long as it zones out the latter and avoids getting too distracted by Torpedoes. Do not stay too close to the edge of a ledge to avoid the splash damage.\nAll Squiffer variants should try to attack with surprise as the range of the Squiffers are only slightly farther than the Kensa Rapid Blaster",
    "- Whenever possible, shoot down opponents' Torpedoes as soon as possible to prevent both the damage and the turfing from the resulting droplets.",
    "- When attacked by an opponent's Baller, if possible, concentrate fire on the Baller – especially with bombs – to quickly destroy it and prevent its explosion.",
    "- If an opponent riding the Tower activates Baller, attack it at a proper angle – away from the Tower's stake – to knock it off of the Tower.",
    "- Splashdown can destroy a Baller if executed before the Baller initiates its explosion. The Baller's user will remain unsplatted, so prepare a follow-up attack.",
    "- All Squiffer variants should try to attack with surprise as the range of the Squiffers are only slightly farther than the Kensa Rapid Blaster",
    "- 13 ability points, or one main and one sub, will improve the jump accuracy by 19.17%.[4]",
    "- 16 ability points – one main and two subs – increase the swim speed from 1.92 DU/f to 2.14 units per frame.[4]"
