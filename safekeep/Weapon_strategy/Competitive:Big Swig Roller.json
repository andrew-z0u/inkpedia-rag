    "The Big Swig Roller is a supportive roller-type weapon which has a wide horizontal flick and farther vertical range compared to most other rollers, and a slightly faster fire rate than the Splat Roller. It covers a very large amount of turf with a single horizontal flick. According to Sheldon, this weapon was made to ink lots of turf, and it has a defense-oriented kit to help make up for its weak damage output.",

    "- The Big Swig Roller can be used well in Turf War and Splat Zones due to its excellent turfing capabilities.",
    "- The sub weapon, Splash Wall, can help protect the player while the Big Swig Roller out-inks opponents and denies large areas. When guarding the objective or getting attacked, the Ink Vac can help protect teammates.",
    "- The Big Swig Roller is weak in combat against other players due to its low damage. However, its high damage to objects is one of its key features. It deals twice as much damage to any object (ex: brella shields, Rainmaker shields, Squid Beakons) as it would to players.",
    "- The Big Swig Roller's quick rate of fire can compensate for its low damage, as it can splat enemies in at most three quick swings.",
    "- The Big Swig Roller is able to cover the weaknesses of some weapons due to its great paint output, like blasters, stringers, or chargers.",
    "- A Splash Wall can be set up right before using Ink Vac to protect you either directly, or indirectly by blocking a route opponents can use to get behind you and kill you.",
    "- The Big Swig Roller cannot output a lot of damage, so weapons with high DPS can easily overwhelm it.",
    "- Due to the Big Swig Roller's low damage at long range, mid- to long-range weapons can hit and out-damage it from safe positions."
