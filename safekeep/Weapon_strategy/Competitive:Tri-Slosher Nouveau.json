    "Like the Tri-Slosher, the Tri-Slosher Nouveau is a mobile, highly damaging slosher that throws its attack in three directions, which also enables it to turf more thoroughly. Unlike its Vanilla variant, its different kit and lower special gauge requirement allow it to also be used in a supportive manner at the cost of not having Burst Bomb combos.",
    "The Tri-Slosher Nouveau has traits of both a slayer's weapon and a support weapon:",
    "The Splat Bomb is a powerful, versatile sub weapon with a variety of purposes suited for any slayer:",
    "Ink Storm is an area of effect (AoE) special weapon that can alter the battle if activated in the right location and direction:",
    "While a team might get away with having one or two users of short-ranged weapons, such as the Tri-Slosher Nouveau, having a team composition with too many short-ranged weapons and no longer-ranged weapons to provide support fire is often disadvantageous for a number of reasons:[7]",
    "Ink Storm is intended for either contesting territory, such as Splat Zones, or stalling opponents' pushes but is not as reliable at splatting opponents who actively avoid the Storm. Therefore, it is advised to have other special weapons available to complement Ink Storm, as having too many users of any combination of Ink Storm and Bomb Launcher (no more than two) in a team composition will limit a team's arsenal of weapons:[7]",
    "Combining Ink Storm with other specials can bolster a team's ability to either make a push or counter the opponents' push:",
    "Gear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.",
    "Ever since its introduction in version 4.3.0, Bomb Defense Up DX will not only reduce the damage taken from opposing sub and special weapons that are not one-hit-splat but will also reduce the duration of the tracking effects of certain opponent's sub and special weapons, such as Point Sensors and Ink Mines, allowing the user of this ability to evade detection more easily. Because the Tri-Slosher Nouveau is a powerful short-ranged weapon, its user can greatly benefit from reducing the damage taken from their opponents' bombs. Just three ability points, or one sub, offer plenty of utility:[8][9]",
    "Unless a Tri-Slosher Nouveau wielder is on an extended splatting streak, they can expect to get splatted often. When equipped, Comeback grants 10 ability points of six different stackable abilities for twenty seconds after respawning from getting splatted by an opponent:",
    "The former three abilities and Swim Speed Up are particularly useful for the Tri-Slosher Nouveau, allowing it to consume less ink and maintain pressure on the opponent upon returning from spawn.[8]",
    "A Tri-Slosher Nouveau user is expected to come in contact with the opponent's ink on various surfaces, which can both be damaging and reduce mobility. Ink Resistance Up not only partially offsets the reduction in mobility but also delays the damage taken from contact with opposing ink.[8][9]",
    "Last-Ditch Effort is a headgear-exclusive ability that, under specific conditions, grants its user 1 to 24 ability points each of the following abilities:",
    "These abilities only begin to take effect under either of the following conditions:",
    "Due to both its relatively high ink consumption and Splat Bombs, the Tri-Slosher Nouveau can greatly benefit from the reduced ink consumption of both the main and sub weapon, reducing the chance that its user runs out of ink during either a crucial defensive stand or a late attempt to reclaim the lead.[8]",
    "Quick Respawn shortens respawn time after getting splatted (under specific conditions), encouraging the Tri-Slosher Nouveau to remain aggressive even after getting splatted.[8]",
    "Quick Super Jump decreases both the \"charge\" time before and the travel time of a Super Jump. Tri-Slosher Nouveau users who include this ability will benefit since Quick Super Jump allows them to both return to the front lines more quickly and escape unfavorable situations more easily to preserve special gauge progress.[8][9]",
    "When splatted, half of the special gauge progress is lost. For example, a player with 140p of special gauge out of 170p upon getting splatted will lose 70p of the special gauge. Special Saver allows its user to keep more of their special gauge progress whenever they are splatted. This allows a Tri-Slosher Nouveau user to more quickly build up Ink Storm after respawning.[8][9]",
    "Super Jumping to a teammate after respawning carries the risk of getting splatted upon landing, due to the appearance of a Super Jump indicator. When equipped, Stealth Jump better covers this indicator from long distance opponents, allowing its user to more safely return to the front lines and maintain pressure on the opponent.[8]",
    "A self-explanatory ability, Swim Speed Up enables an already mobile Tri-Slosher Nouveau user to more rapidly close the distance towards an opponent, more quickly respond to an opponents' push, or even escape unfavorable situations.",
    "[12]",
    "- Its high damage (62 HP) and relatively quick rate of fire for a slosher-class weapon (12-16 frames for the first shot, 24 frames between shots) translate into quick two-shot splats, making it deadly in both flanking and sharking.",
    "- Its range (120 DU) is just longer than that of both the Splattershot and the N-ZAP '85 (116.99 DU) but shorter than that of the .52 Gal (124.944 DU).[3] Both this range and its wide shot spread make it difficult for opponents with shorter-ranged weapons – particularly brushes and most rollers – to safely approach a Tri-Slosher Nouveau user.",
    "- The Tri-Slosher Nouveau's lightweight nature gives it more inherent mobility than many other slayer's weapons, allowing its user to either pursue opponents or escape unfavorable matchups more easily.",
    "- Its wide shots enable its user to rapidly turf large areas to either gain or maintain map control, quickly capture Splat Zones, and farm Ink Storm.",
    "- The arc-like trajectory of the Tri-Slosher Nouveau's shots has a couple unique applications:\nShots can be fired up a ledge or incline more easily than a shooter's shots can, making it valuable for both sharking beneath short perches and pushing up slopes or walls.\nShots can also be launched over some obstacles, hitting opponents who may hide behind them.",
    "- While quick at both splatting and turfing, the Tri-Slosher Nouveau does have two weaknesses:\nLike other slosher-class weapons, its rate of fire is slower than that of most shooters. For example, both the Splattershot (35 HP, 3-11 frames for the first shot, 6 frames between shots, totaling 15-23 frames to reach 100 HP damage) and the N-ZAP '85 (28 HP, 3-11 frames for the first shot, 5 frames between shots, totaling 18-26 frames) have quicker splatting times than the Tri-Slosher Nouveau (36-40 frames).\nSuper Jump camping can also be tricky because of the slower firing rate. To splat a Super Jumping opponent at their landing spot without using Splat Bombs (i.e. when low on ink), take advantage of the lack of falloff damage by firing a globule of ink above the marker a little before the opponent lands, then fire right when the opponent lands and, if you timed your first shot correctly, you should be able to splat the opponent.[4].\nWhile more mobile than other slosher-class weapons, the Tri-Slosher Nouveau still has less mobility (0.66 DU/f) than weapons of comparable range, such as the Splattershot (0.72 DU/f) and the N-ZAP '85 (0.84 DU/f). This reduced mobility makes its user an easier target for long-ranged opponents to pick off.\nThe Tri-Slosher Nouveau consumes ink more quickly than do most shooters. Aimlessly flailing it around will rapidly deplete the ink tank, leaving its user very vulnerable to attack.",

    "- It pairs very well with the main weapon in combos due to its short detonation time. Opponents with no Bomb Defense Up DX equipped and no more than 92 HP when hit by a Splat Bomb's splash damage (30 HP) can be splatted with one hit by the main weapon (62 HP).",
    "- It can also be used for poking at and zoning out opponents during the neutral phase, stalling an opponent's push, or denying opponents safe access to important areas of the stage, such as the Tower, that might not be easy to fire at with the main weapon.",
    "- Carefully lobbing a Splat Bomb at an opposing anchor positioned on their snipe will hinder their ability to control space with their range.",
    "- If a shorter-ranged opponent gets too close, either dropping a Splat Bomb at your feet or rolling it like a bowling ball can provide time and space to escape.",
    "- A Splat Bomb can damage or destroy an opponent's brella shield, Splash Wall, or Baller or the Rainmaker shield, while detonating on contact.\nAny opponents caught within the Splat Bomb's explosion will get damaged or splatted.[5]\nIt will also inflate or pop a teammate's bubbles but deflate or diffuse an opponent's bubbles, while still detonating on contact.[6]",
    "- Any opponents caught within the Splat Bomb's explosion will get damaged or splatted.[5]",
    "- It will also inflate or pop a teammate's bubbles but deflate or diffuse an opponent's bubbles, while still detonating on contact.[6]",
    "- Immediately upon activating the special, its user will be holding the Ink Storm device and be vulnerable to attack. Therefore, do not activate the special while being attacked, and make sure to throw it onto a surface before an opponent gets the opportunity to splat you.",
    "- Slower, less mobile opponents – especially Rainmaker carriers – are less capable of escaping Ink Storm's area of effect and, thus, are more adversely affected.",
    "- Its gradual damage makes it a good counter against Ink Armor, especially when paired with Object Shredder.",
    "- Ink Storm's damage on the opponent becomes more effective whenever the opponent has less space to maneuver around, such as in an alley or on the Tower.",
    "- Defensively, Ink Storm can slow or disrupt the opponents' push by either altering their intended attack routes or weakening any opponents within the storm.",
    "- Offensively, Ink Storm can soften opposing defenses by forcing opponents out of optimal positions and inflicting chip damage onto those caught in the ink rain.",
    "- Besides potentially damaging opponents, Ink Storm also gradually turfs any non-vertical surface it travels over:\nThe damaging and turfing effects of Ink Storm are slower and more gradual than those of a Bomb Launcher but are automatic and does not require its user to risk endangering themselves.",
    "- An Ink Storm above the Rainmaker can either weaken its shield to pop it or prevent the opponent from popping it.",
    "- Special weapons are also free ink tank refills, allowing a Tri-Slosher Nouveau user to launch Ink Storm and immediately attack opponents fleeing it.",
    "- The damaging and turfing effects of Ink Storm are slower and more gradual than those of a Bomb Launcher but are automatic and does not require its user to risk endangering themselves.",
    "- An opponent with a long-ranged weapon can more aggressively position themselves to zone out the entire shorter-ranged team.",
    "- The opposing slayers can play more aggressively, knowing that there is no long-ranged threat to pick them off from afar.",
    "- Ink Storm provides no direct means of protection, meaning that opponents can still fire or throw sub weapons into the Storm.",
    "- Other special weapons, such as Inkjet or Sting Ray, are intended for splatting opponents and more capable at this than is Ink Storm.",
    "- Ink Armor and other protective special weapons, such as Baller and Bubble Blower, can increase the survivability of a team as they push into contested territory.",
    "- After launching Ink Storm, a teammate who is using a special weapon designed for splat opponents, such as Sting Ray or Inkjet, can further limit the opponents' escape options or splat them as they scatter.",
    "- Matchups between Tri-Slosher Nouveaus on opposing teams are determined by each player's skill, positioning, turf control, and the presence of any teammates.",
    "- Any weapon that has a combination of longer range, better accuracy, or higher damage output without sacrificing too much mobility can counter a Tri-Slosher Nouveau. For example, both the L-3 Nozzlenose and Dualie Squelchers and their respective variants meet all of these requirements.",
    "- The wielder of a shorter ranged, quicker firing weapon should flank, shark, or outmaneuver (e.g. via dodge rolling) the Tri-Slosher Nouveau to exploit its slower firing rate.",
    "- A long-ranged weapon, such as a charger or most splatlings, can attack a Tri-Slosher Nouveau from long distance with impunity. However, once the Tri-Slosher Nouveau gets close, the tables are turned, as it can outmaneuver and outdraw its less mobile, slower firing opponent.",
    "- Like most roller users, an opposing Tri-Slosher Nouveau user tends to thrive when they are sharking, especially beneath short ledges. Their mobility and damage output also makes them deadly at flanking as well. Fortunately, you can take a few proactive measures:\nKeep track of all four members of the opposing team – which ones are present, which ones are splatted, and which ones are back at their spawn point.\nCheck the map periodically for opposing ink forming around flanks to anticipate a flanking attack.\nTo prevent sharking, check suspicious puddles of the opponents' ink, preferably with a thrown sub weapon.\nRemain farther back on ledges to avoid any arc damage.\nWeapons that track opponents, such as Point Sensors, temporarily prevent an opponent from sharking and makes them an easier target for long-ranged teammates to pick off.\nHave a means to back up and retreat. Do not attempt to fight back until you have a clear line of sight of the opposing Tri-Slosher Nouveau user.",
    "- When pursued by an opposing Tri-Slosher Nouveau user, using almost any sub weapon (except for Squid Beakons) can either delay their pursuit or deter them from chasing.",
    "- When pursuing an opposing Tri-Slosher Nouveau user, be wary of any Splat Bombs they might plant while retreating, such as around a corner or after climbing a ledge.",
    "- When facing an opposing Ink Storm, assess where is a safe place to either reroute an attack or reposition on defense:\nIn general, avoid getting caught under an opponent's Ink Storm for an extended time, but also be wary of opponents waiting to pick off anyone fleeing the Storm.",
    "- When facing a team who possesses both Ink Storm and main weapons whose damage is increased with Main Power Up, pay extra attention to where the Main Power Up-boosted opponents are at whenever they launch their Ink Storm.\nIf you must travel under an opponent's Ink Storm, avoid moving in the same direction that the Storm is traveling to minimize damage.\nEven while avoiding an opponent's Ink Storm, it is still possible to turf or otherwise influence the area underneath. Long-ranged weapons, thrown sub weapons, and other special weapons (such as a counter-Ink Storm or Bomb Launcher) can splat opponents or dissuade them from occupying the turf underneath.",

    "- The splash damage of most bombs is reduced from 30 HP to 28.6 HP. This reduction in damage provides two benefits:\nIt prevents its user from being exposed on their opponents' map by the splash damage of most single bombs.\nInk Armor will not break due to splash damage from a single bomb whose splash damage normally inflicts 30 HP of damage.",
    "- The splash damage of near-misses from either Tenta Missiles or Inkjet, the minimum splash damage of bubbles, and the collision damage from Baller are all reduced from 50 HP to 48.3 HP,[10] enabling one to survive two hits from any of these specific means of special weapon damage.",

    "- Therefore, a Tri-Slosher Nouveau user with Ninja Squid will have to decide between either having fewer ability points available for other abilities or swimming at less than the base maximum speed. For example, just 13 ability points – one main and one sub – are enough to restore the swim speed of a Tri-Slosher Nouveau user with Ninja Squid to 1.92 units per frame.[11]"
