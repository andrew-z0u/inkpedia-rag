    "Contrary to its appearance and name, the Splatana Wiper is not a melee weapon. Instead, its playstyle is centered around mid-range poking with its slash attacks and Torpedoes, while having the close-range one hit splat from the charged slash as a backup for opponents who get too close.",
    "The Splatana Wiper's consistent long-range damage, high mobility, and close ranged one shot fit the role of a skirmisher.",
    "The Splatana Wiper also has some weaknesses.",
    "Torpedoes are a noxious distraction tool, poking at opponents during the neutral phase and being able to combo with the main weapon.",
    "If used properly, the Ultra Stamp can tilt the game in the user's team's favor:",
    "As of 2.0.0, the Splatana Wiper now has good painting with uncharged slashes with no gaps in between the trails of ink it leaves.",
    "Gear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.",
    "Unless a Splatana Wiper user is on an extended splatting streak, they can expect to get splatted often. When equipped, Comeback grants 10 ability points of six different stackable abilities for twenty seconds after respawning from getting splatted by an opponent:",
    "Ink Saver (Sub) and Swim Speed Up are the most useful for the Splatana Wiper wielder, allowing them to throw Torpedoes more often and more quickly pursue and pressure the opponent upon returning from spawn.",
    "Last-Ditch Effort is a headgear-exclusive ability that, under specific conditions, grants its user 1 to 24 ability points each of the following abilities:",
    "These abilities only begin to take effect under either of the following conditions:",
    "The Splatana Wiper can greatly benefit from both the overall reduced ink consumption and quicker ink recovery, allowing its user to more freely use Torpedoes during either a crucial defensive stand or a late attempt to reclaim the lead.",
    "Ninja Squid reduces detection by opponents while swimming on non-vertical surfaces. It allows its user to swim at full speed undetected and get close to opponents to splat opponents in one hit. It can also be used to escape opponents without getting noticed.",
    "Super Jumping to a teammate after respawning carries the risk of getting splatted upon landing, due to the presence of a Super Jump indicator. When equipped, Stealth Jump better covers this indicator from long distance opponents, allowing its user to more safely return to the front lines and maintain pressure on the opponent.",
    "Swim Speed Up can help close the distance towards an opponent, more quickly respond to an opponents' push, or escape unfavorable situations.",
    "Quick Respawn shortens respawn time after getting splatted (under specific conditions), encouraging a Splatana Wiper user to remain aggressive even after getting splatted. This ability is particularly effective for skirmisher weapons, which may often get splatted before splatting anybody.",
    "Quick Super Jump decreases the \"charge\" time before a Super Jump. All weapons benefit from this ability since Quick Super Jump allows them to both return to the front lines more quickly and escape unfavorable situations more easily to preserve special gauge progress.",
    "Haunt is a clothing exclusive ability that, upon being splatted by an opponent, will track them via a white silhouette until they are splatted. If the user is the first person to splat the tracked player after they splat you, that player will receive the effects of Respawn Punisher. This is especially useful for a skirmisher, as they will often be dying without splatting anybody, and Haunt can be run with Quick Respawn to further enhance this playstyle.",
    "When on the front lines, any Splatana Wiper user is bound to come into contact with enemy ink on various surfaces. which can both be damaging and reduce mobility. Ink Resistance Up not only partially offsets the reduction in mobility but also delays the damage taken from contact with opposing ink.",
    "Not recommended. Much like using Run Speed Up on a roller, this ability has no effect on the Splatana Wiper's strafing speed while swinging, holding the charged slash, or dashing forward with the charged slash.",
    "Not recommended. These abilities do not provide as much benefit to a Splatana Wiper user as other weapons.",
    "First impressions of the Splatana Wiper from competitive players following the Splatoon 3 Splatfest World Premiere were mixed. For example, competitive veteran Sendou considered the weapon to be outclassed,[3] and some players such as Kyo considered the weapon to just be plain bad.[4] On the other hand, some players, such as Chara, found the weapon to be situational, but fine as is and difficult to learn.[5][6] Further worsening the opinions on the Splatana Wiper were likely because of apparent nerfs to Ultra Stamp hitboxes, which were later confirmed to be bugs that were later patched in 1.2.0.[7]",
    "Due to its lack of competitive usage during 1.1.0, its true potential had yet to be seen, though some players like Arashi, a former member of Prophecy and Last Resort, uses the weapon in competitive play and is testing its true potential.[8]",
    "The 2.0.0 update significantly improved the weapon's ink coverage while using normal swings to be consistent inked lines. This buff pushed the weapon to the meta with its other strengths such as the mobility allowing the weapon to play very aggressively similar to the Dark Tetra Dualies. Its object damage also allows the weapon to be consistently used due to the amount of Crab Tanks in the meta. The weapon has been put very highly on tier lists with its strengths being especially strong in this meta.[9]",
    "However ever since Tacticooler became viable and later meta, opinions on the Splatana Wiper have dropped in viability. The buffs from Tacticooler boosting other players strafe speed has helped other weapons be able to play in the same mobility as the Wiper. Along with Wiper not being affected by Run Speed Up, Wiper has ended up losing its unique niche as a fast mobile weapon that can get splatted often without worry, a similar fate to the Dark Tetra Dualies. The meta has also shifted from having many HP specials to being a more aggressive meta where weapons that can kill quickly and reliably are more valued. Splatana Wiper and Ultra Stamp's high object damage has become less valuable and its weaknesses of a slow kill time and its unreliable special has been more exploited, in addition to more shooters and splatlings in the meta that can deal with Ultra Stamp and Torpedoes without worry. Splatana Wiper still is seen as a solid weapon by many competitive players, but it has seen significantly less use compared to in Crab Tank meta.",

    "- The Splatana Wiper has two different ways of attacking:\nCharged slashes deal consistent 60 damage when not close, allowing reliable splatting if the user can track the opponent.\nOpponents up close to a Splatana Wiper user can be splatted in one hit with a charged slash, which can be useful against flankers.\nThey also ink a solid trail of ink, allowing the weapon to paint fairly well.\nIf holding the L stick forward while doing a charged slash, the user will dash forward before performing the slash. Use this to get close to opponents, although be careful of any bombs in the way.\nUncharged slashes, while quicker, deal less damage at 30. While not the main way to splat opponents, the user can combo two uncharged slashes with a charged slash for a quicker splat time. At point blank range, the damage scales up to 45, making the kill time one slash faster. It isn't recommended to do this, however, unless your enemy has run out of ink.\nUncharged slashes will leave a trail of ink with no gaps in between. This along with its fast strafe speed, will help enhance its mobility, paint and to capture zones in Splat Zones.\nWith its range and no falloff damage, users should stay close to the frontlines, but not too close to take advantage of its range to splat opponents.",
    "- Be careful of any walls that may be above an opponent, as the ink flung from the Splatana Wiper will disappear as it touches a wall, shortening the range.",
    "- Another strength of the Splatana Wiper is its mobility, allowing the user to evade ink shots quickly.",
    "- Charged slashes deal consistent 60 damage when not close, allowing reliable splatting if the user can track the opponent.\nOpponents up close to a Splatana Wiper user can be splatted in one hit with a charged slash, which can be useful against flankers.\nThey also ink a solid trail of ink, allowing the weapon to paint fairly well.\nIf holding the L stick forward while doing a charged slash, the user will dash forward before performing the slash.

    "- Its linear ink line from the charged slash is very thin. The user will have to be accurate in order to finish opponents.",
    "- The kill time with the uncharged slashes is relatively slow compared to other weapons of the same range. Using Torpedoes or charged slashes can help speed it up, but be spacious of other quicker opponents.",
    "- While its range is more than most shorter ranged weapons, it still has some short range. Longer ranged opponents can easily splat a Wiper user without much risk.",
    "- Aiming a Torpedo above or behind an opponent will force them to divert their aim. This is especially effective against opponents wielding single-shot weapons, such as blasters or chargers, or the slow turning Crab Tank.",
    "- When rolled on the floor or against a wall like a Splat Bomb, a Torpedo will remain in its first stage and explode in a similar fashion, albeit less powerfully. If a direct hit (60 HP damage) is confirmed, immediately follow up with a charged slash (60 HP) to quickly splat most opponents.",
    "- Both phases of the Torpedo can aid in turfing along with the main weapon, aiding in both mobility and building up the special gauge.",
    "- While only one Torpedo may be used at a time, Ink Saver (Sub) can still conserve ink for each Torpedo used, saving ink for either another Torpedo or the main weapon.",
    "- Aiming a Torpedo above or behind an opponent will force them to divert their aim. This is especially effective against opponents wielding single-shot weapons, such as blasters or chargers, or the slow turning Crab Tank.",
    "- If Ultra Stamp is activated too far from an opponent, especially one with a long-ranged weapon with a straight trajectory (such as a charger or splatling), the opponent can fire in between hammer swings and splat the Ultra Stamp wielder. Either get close enough to an opponent or shark and wait for the opponent to come close before activating the Ultra Stamp, providing little to no time to react.",
    "- Do not run in a predictable manner while swinging the Ultra Stamp, as an adept opponent can outmaneuver past an Ultra Stamp user and splat them from behind.",
    "- It is possible to swim in friendly ink while Ultra Stamp is active. This allows an Ultra Stamp wielder to maneuver more easily than while swinging, climb vertical surfaces, cross and drop through grates, and – most importantly – hide more easily before striking.",
    "- Swinging the Ultra Stamp in midair can splat opponents who are higher than ground level, such as on the edge of a ledge that is just too high to reach by jumping.",
    "- The Ultra Stamp can quickly destroy brella shields and most sub weapons, including Splash Walls, allowing one to break through opposing defenses and stop opponents' pushes. Just stay away from opposing bombs that are just about to detonate.",
    "- While the Ultra Stamp can quickly pop the Rainmaker shield, as it expands, the shield can splat an Ultra Stamp user who is too close. Keep a safe distance by constantly jumping back while striking the shield.[2]",
    "- Do not forget that the Ultra Stamp can be thrown by pressing :\nWhen faced against an opponent with a long-ranged weapon (such as a charger or splatling) from a long distance, it is usually wiser to throw the Ultra Stamp at the opponent than to either charge or swim towards them. A well-aimed thrown Ultra Stamp can throw off an opponent's aim or displace them from their spot, potentially providing enough time to close the distance.\nTo maximize the use of an Ultra Stamp, throw it towards an opponent at or near the end of its 9 second duration after splatting any nearby opponents. An Ultra Stamp should only be thrown early if no other options are present, such as preventing a faraway opposing Rainmaker carrier from taking the lead.",

    "- Slow weapons like the Hydra Splatling or Tenta Brella can synergize with the Splatana Wiper for chip damage and help with paint, which most slow weapons lack.",
    "- Matchups between two opposing Splatana Wiper users will depend on skill, positioning, turf control, and the presence of any supporting players.",
    "- To engage a Splatana Wiper with a shorter range weapon, try to catch it off guard through either careful flanking or sharking, better positioning, or wise use of bombs. Do not get too close as the Splatana Wiper can splat the opponent in one hit if close enough.",
    "- Any longer ranged opponent can splat the opponent without risking getting splatted. However, if the Splatana Wiper user gets too close, their one shot and mobility can pressure the opponent.",
    "- Whenever possible, shoot down the Splatana Wiper's Torpedoes as soon as possible to prevent both the damage and the turfing from the resulting droplets.",
    "- Watch the HUD at the top of the screen to see if the user has their Ultra Stamp ready before fighting it. The user could potentially pull it out and do a jump attack for a quick surprise splat.\nIf an opponent is using Ultra Stamp too far, a long-ranged, non-slosher weapon (such as a charger or splatling) can fire in between swings to splat them.\nIf an opposing Ultra Stamp is fast approaching, anticipate its movement and attempt to maneuver behind it and splat its user.\nRemember that an opponent swinging an Ultra Stamp cannot travel up vertical surfaces without an ink trail.\nBrella shields and Splash Walls are ineffective as they are easily destroyed by the Ultra Stamp.\nThe Crab Tank can splat the Splatana user between Ultra Stamp swings if the fire rate is high enough, but the Crab Tank could also be destroyed or get splatted if the Ultra Stamp gets too close.",
