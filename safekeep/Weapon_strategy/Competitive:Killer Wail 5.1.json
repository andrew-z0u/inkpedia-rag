    "- The way a Killer Wail 5.1 laser moves is very easy to manipulate as an opponent, as it just follows your path but it is slightly behind, even copying your exact speed.\nDue to this, it can be exploited to not displace you as much as other displacement specials would.",
    "- Squid Rolling through a set of lasers if you want to turn around can reduce the damage taken, due to Squid Rolls giving armor for a short period of time.",
    "- Depending on the weapons your opponents have, it may be worth it to tank a slight bit of damage when a laser is about to disappear to be displaced for less time.",
    "- Due to this, it can be exploited to not displace you as much as other displacement specials would."
