    "The Rapid Blaster Deco is a main weapon in the Splatoon series. It is the Deco-branded version of the Rapid Blaster.",
    "The Rapid Blaster Deco is nearly identical in appearance to the Rapid Blaster. The only difference between the two is that the Rapid Blaster Deco has stickers bearing the Deco logo on the sides.",
    "In Splatoon 3, the pink color that was present on the Rapid Blaster has been changed to blue.",
    "The Rapid Blaster Deco comes in a set with Suction Bombs and the Bomb Rush.",
    "[1]",
    "As you can likely guess, the Rapid Blaster Deco is just a Rapid Blaster that's been, well, decorated!\nThis version comes with Suction Bombs, which are great for forcing sneaky foes out into the open.\nAnd with the Bomb Rush special, you'll be able to toss those bombs to your heart's content!\n(NA)",
    "The Rapid Blaster Deco was released on 27 January 2018 at 02:00 UTC.[2] It comes with Suction Bombs and the Inkjet.",
    "[3][4]",
    "The Rapid Blaster Deco is a decorated version of the Rapid Blaster. The stats are the same as the Rapid Blaster, but combined with the Suction Bombs, it's a great weapon for pushing forward. You can also use the Inkjet to draw your opponents' attention! Recommended for players who value offense and defense equally!",
    "The Rapid Blaster Deco returns in Splatoon 3 as of Fresh Season 2023. It functions the same as the normal Rapid Blaster but has a different kit and appearance. It has Deco arrow stickers on the sides and a blue color scheme, as opposed to the traditional red one. Its kit consists of Torpedo and Inkjet. The weapon was teased in the Fresh Season poster on 16 February 2023 and officially revealed on 21 February 2023. It released on 28 February 2023.",
    "The Rapid Blaster Deco is a cool, decorated version of the Rapid Blaster. Not that the original isn't cool! You'll have to decide for yourself which one you like better. Maybe the overall loadout will help you make the choice! This one comes with the Torpedo sub to help make up for the main weapon's somewhat low attack power. And for those moments when you want to breach the front lines, you've got the Inkjet special! Not a bad little surprise to keep in your back pocket. This is a versatile set that can really shine with the right user, so I hope you get a chance to try it out!",
