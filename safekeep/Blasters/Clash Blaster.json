    "The Clash Blaster is a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3, manufactured by Neo. It is a blaster with a high rate of fire and large blast radius, but with low damage.",
    "The Clash Blaster fires at a short range, and at very high speed, but takes two direct hits to splat an opponent; from afar it takes around four hits.\nThe Clash Blaster behaves as a pressure-based weapon. Compared to other blasters, which require a direct hit for quick splats, the Clash Blaster fires more rapidly, increasing mobility and turf coverage.",
    "The Clash Blaster's main body is a light navy blue and shaped a bit like a pencil sharpener. Surrounding it is a ring of crayons that change color to match the user's ink that resembles a gun belt. Coming down from the body is a metal trigger and a handhold with black padding. Sticking out of the front of the body is a flat, rectangular, metal part that delivers the shots. Atop this part is a sight the same color as the body.",
    "The Clash Blaster was released in Splatoon 2 at the game's initial release. Its kit contains Splat Bomb and Sting Ray.",
    "It appears in two Octo Expansion stations:",
    "[1][2]",
    "You know how blasters tend to have a low rate of fire? Not the Clash Blaster! Its speedy shots are great for keeping foes at bay! Damage output has been decreased to compensate for improved rapid fire, but Splat Bombs will help you take it to your foes in a major way! Opponents keeping their distance? Reach out and touch 'em with the Sting Ray! If you like causing chaos on the front lines, this set's for you!",
    "The Clash Blaster returns in Splatoon 3 with the same attributes and appearance as the previous game. Its set is Splat Bomb and Trizooka.",
    "It appears in one mission in Return of the Mammalians:",
    "[3]",
    "You know how blasters tend to have a low rate of fire? Not the Clash Blaster! Its speedy shots are great for keeping foes at bay! Now, it's not going to win any awards for power, but when you have Splat Bombs to corner your enemies, it'll get the job done. And if an opponent still manages to slip away? That's when you trash 'em with the Trizooka. Talk about a chaotic combo. If that sounds fun, this loadout is for you!",
