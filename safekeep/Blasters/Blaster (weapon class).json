    "Blasters are one of the main weapon classes in the Splatoon series.",
    "Blasters are fully-automatic weapons that fire large globs of ink that travel forward and conclude their path with an explosion. They typically have a relatively low fire rate and high ink consumption compared to many other weapons.",
    "While blasters have been in the Splatoon series since Splatoon, games prior to Splatoon 3 classified them as shooters because the two classes share a few technical characteristics. In Splatoon 3, blasters are classified as a separate weapon class.",
    "Note: The series are arranged by their respective order in the weapon select screen with the Main filter.",
