    "The Grizzco Blaster is a Salmon Run rare weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3. It appears to be an illegitimately modified[1] Blaster.",
    "The weapon is a short-ranged blaster with an extremely high firing speed, possibly due to most of its frame being stripped down and modified. The range of the weapon is comparable to the Luna Blaster while the firing rate of the weapon is much greater than even the Clash Blaster.",
    "The Grizzco Blaster is somewhat similar in appearance to the Blaster. However, the front has been completely stripped off, revealing the metal frame and inner workings. Multiple red and orange wires and metal blocks can be seen. Sticking out of the top are four yellow pill bottles with white caps, the contents of which are unknown. The ink tank has a dark green Grizzco Industries logo on the side.",
    "The Grizzco Blaster is a rare weapon only available during Salmon Run wildcard rotations. It was first available on 16 September 2017 at 00:00 UTC.",
    "In Splatoon 2, the Grizzco Blaster was available during the following wildcard rotations:",
    "The Grizzco Blaster returns in Splatoon 3, and is once again only available during wildcard rotations in Salmon Run. It was first available on 28 October 2022 at 08:00 UTC.",
