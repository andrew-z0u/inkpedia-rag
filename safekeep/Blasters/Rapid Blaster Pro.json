    "The Rapid Blaster Pro is a main weapon in the Splatoon series, manufactured by Deco.",
    "The Rapid Blaster Pro is a Rapid Blaster with an elongated handle and barrel, and increased range to match. Its range is the greatest of all blasters. As a trade-off, it has a slightly slower fire rate and higher ink consumption compared to the Rapid Blaster. Damage output and blast size are identical for both weapons.",
    "The Rapid Blaster Pro is similar in appearance to the Rapid Blaster. However, the nozzle is longer, and there is a gray bar connecting the red panels at the bottom to the handle.",
    "The Rapid Blaster Pro was released on 17 October 2015 at 02:00 UTC.[1] It comes with Seekers and the Inkzooka. Each shot consumes 10% of the ink tank capacity, and the ink tank recovers 1.67% of its capacity between each shot, allowing the player to fire 11 shots before needing to refill on ink.",
    "[2]",
    "The Rapid Blaster Pro is based on the Rapid Blaster, but it's further specialized for increased range. Follow your Seekers to zip into an advantageous position and strike from your opponent's blind spot! The Inkzooka makes this a great set for frontline fighters who like to cause big problems for their foes!(NA)",
    "The Rapid Blaster Pro returns in Splatoon 2 looking identical to how it did in the first game. It was released on 23 September 2017 at 02:00 UTC[3]. It comes with the Toxic Mist and Ink Storm. Each shot consumes 8% of the ink tank capacity, allowing the player to fire 12 shots before needing to refill on ink.",
    "It appears in seven Octo Expansion stations:",
    "[4][5]",
    "The Rapid Blaster Pro owes its incredible range to a chamber system that delays ink oxidization to the last possible moment!\nIf you match this range with the Toxic Mist, your opponents will curse your very existence!\nThe Ink Storm provides cover for your teammates, so I'd recommend this set for players who enjoy the technical aspects of battle!",
    "The Rapid Blaster Pro returns in Splatoon 3 with a new design. Its kit is the Toxic Mist and Ink Vac.",
    "It appears in two missions in Return of the Mammalians:",
    "[6]",
    "The Rapid Blaster Pro owes its incredible range to a chamber system that delays ink oxidization to the last possible moment! With that technology in hand, try catching your enemies in a little Toxic Mist before giving them a few inksplosions as a parting gift. And if anyone gets too close? Fire up the Ink Vac, and turn their own inkpower against them! This is a set that will make the tactically inclined player veeery happy.",
