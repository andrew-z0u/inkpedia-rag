    "The Rapid Blaster is a main weapon in the Splatoon series, manufactured by Deco.",
    "The Rapid Blaster is a shooter in Splatoon and Splatoon 2, and a blaster in Splatoon 3, that is similar to the Blaster, but fires much faster and has greater range. However, this comes at the cost of less ink coverage, a smaller blast radius, and weaker shots. At minimum, it takes one direct hit and one indirect hit to splat an opponent with this weapon. Its close relative, the Rapid Blaster Pro, has slightly longer range and a slightly slower fire rate. The fire rate is faster than that of the Luna Blaster, and slower than that of the Clash Blaster.",
    "The Rapid Blaster is mainly gray with a black handle. Multiple red panels are located on the top and sides. The tip of the barrel, which is connected to the body with a small black tube, is orange.",
    "The Rapid Blaster comes with Ink Mines and Bubbler. Each shot consumes 8% of the ink tank capacity, and the ink tank recovers 1.67% of its capacity between each shot, allowing the player to fire 15 shots before needing to refill the tank.",
    "[1]",
    "The Rapid Blaster is a Blaster modified to increase its rate of fire and ink efficiency. It's not as powerful as the Blaster, but its fast shots and powerful Ink Mines are great for pressuring foes. With a Bubbler as well, it's probably the easiest blaster to use, so I'd recommend giving it a try!(NA)",
    "The Rapid Blaster returns in Splatoon 2 looking identical to how it was in the first game, but with a slightly tweaked performance. It comes with Ink Mines and Splat-Bomb Launcher. Each shot consumes 7% of the ink tank capacity, allowing the player to fire 14 shots before needing to refill the tank.",
    "It appears in five Octo Expansion stations:",
    "[2][3]",
    "The Rapid Blaster features an improved rate of fire and reduced ink consumption. It comes with the trade-off of less attack power, but you can reveal your opponents' positions to teammates with the Ink Mine! Finish off the tracked opponents with the Splat-Bomb Launcher! Recommended for players that like to work closely with their team!",
    "The Rapid Blaster returns in Splatoon 3 with an updated design, and has Ink Mines as its sub and Triple Inkstrike as its special.",
    "It appears in one mission in Return of the Mammalians:",
    "[4]",
    "The Rapid Blaster lives up to its name with an improved rate of fire and modest ink consumption. Now, if you know me at all, you know I'm going to tell you about a big trade-off, and it's this: low power. But using the Ink Mine to reveal enemy positions helps make up for it. What I'd do with a combo like this is use the Rapid Blaster to create a whirlwind of ink, then take it to the next level with a Triple Inkstrike. This setup lets you focus in on key areas of the map - whether you're defending the home base or pushing an advance into hostile territory.",
