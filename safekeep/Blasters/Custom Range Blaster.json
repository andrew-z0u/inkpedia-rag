    "The Custom Range Blaster is a main weapon in the Splatoon series. It is a Custom-branded version of the Range Blaster.",
    "The Custom Range Blaster is nearly identical in appearance to the Range Blaster. The only difference between the two is that the Custom Range Blaster has a sticker bearing the Custom logo on the front part.",
    "The Custom Range Blaster was released on 10 October 2015 at 02:00 UTC.[1] It is a variation of a regular Range Blaster with different sub and special weapons, comes with Splat Bombs and the Kraken.",
    "[2]",
    "The Custom Range Blaster is, as you might expect, a Range Blaster with a slick customized appearance. It has the same stats but comes with Splat Bombs to compensate for its lack of efficacy at close range. Coupled with the powerful Kraken, this set should prove popular with blaster virtuosos!(NA)",
    "The Custom Range Blaster was released on 21 April 2018 at 02:00 UTC.[3] It comes with Curling Bombs and the Bubble Blower. In an earlier data mining, it was shown to have Sting Ray as its special, but this was changed before release.",
    "[4][5]",
    "The Custom Range Blaster is a customized version of the Range Blaster that uses certified official parts! It has all the same stats of the Range Blaster, but you can use the Curling Bomb sub to pin the enemy down before you blast 'em! Lock down the battlefield lickety-splat by bursting the bubbles you make with the Bubble Blower. A set for the true Blaster aficionado!",
    "The Custom Range Blaster returns in Splatoon 3 as a part of Sizzle Season 2024. Its kit consists of Splat Bomb  and Kraken Royale, referencing its Splatoon kit. Like the previous games, its design is the same as the Range Blaster but with a white Custom Sticker on the top of the barrel. Like the Custom Blaster in Splatoon 3, the Custom logo was rotated 180 degrees.",
    "[6]",
    "The Custom Range Blaster is a customized version of the Range Blaster that uses certified official parts! It has all the same stats of the Range Blaster, but you can use the Splat Bomb sub to pin the enemy down before blasting away. And if anyone slips through your defenses, give 'em the business with a Kraken Royale! That should buy you time to get repositioned. All in all, it's the perfect setup for keeping your opponents at range—just the way you want it!",
