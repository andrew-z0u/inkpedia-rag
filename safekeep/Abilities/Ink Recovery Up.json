    "If the player finds themselves running out of ink quickly, this ability should be considered. Depending on the cause of the ink consumption, Ink Saver (Main) or Ink Saver (Sub) may also be good candidates; Ink Recovery Up in use with Ink Savers serves a similar purpose, allowing the player to spend more time using weapons by either prolonging the tank or refilling it quicker. The increased ink recovery from this ability means that less time is needed in squid or octopus form to refill, making it particularly useful in Turf Wars where covering lots of turf with ink is needed. Ink Recovery Up is generally recommended for heavy ink weapons such as chargers and splatlings, which use a lot of ink before refilling.",
