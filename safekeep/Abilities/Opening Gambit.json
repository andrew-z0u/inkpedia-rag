    "Opening Gambit is a gear primary ability in the Splatoon series.",
    "Opening Gambit gives the user Run Speed Up and Swim Speed Up, Ink Resistance Up starting in Splatoon 2, and Intensify Action starting in Splatoon 3 for the first 30 seconds of the battle. In Splatoon 2, that time is extended by 7.5 seconds for each splat or assist the user gets while the ability is still active. In Splatoon 3, the time by which it is extended is 15 seconds instead.",
    "Opening Gambit is a high risk, high reward ability. The high amount of mobility its effect provides and the short timer extensions that splats/assists grant means Opening Gambit demands high aggression and skillful play. It works best on midrange weapons that can take better advantage of the provided mobility and secure splats/assists consistently.",
