    "Gear abilities, or simply abilities, are special attributes that are placed on wearable gear in the Splatoon series. Each provides different effects in Turf Wars and Ranked Battles, and the strength of said effects is usually based on the amount of the specific ability the player has.",
    "All pieces of gear come with exactly one specific primary ability (also called the main ability, often colloquially referred to as simply \"main\"). Stackable main abilities provide 10 AP each.",
    "Titles before Splatoon 3, which allows replacing the primary ability with ability chunks, do not allow changing the primary ability after obtaining the piece of gear it comes with. However, Splatoon 2 allows obtaining pieces of gear with an alternate primary ability: all pieces of gear that can be ordered via Murch (which mostly consist of ones that can be purchased from in-game shops) can also appear on the SplatNet 2 shop with a different primary ability than their default ones. Gear obtained through Salmon Run does not have a default primary ability and is instead randomly assigned from all abilities that can also appear as secondary abilities. Gear from the Nintendo Switch App SplatNet are randomly assigned primary abilities, but have a bias towards the brands more common ability.",
    "All pieces of gear do not have primary abilities that match the gear's gear brand's favored ability (except for a few, which were originally sold through SplatNet 2). As a result, achieving all slots on a piece of gear to be the same ability (colloquially called \"pure\" gear) is more difficult. However, if the player is under the effects of the drink whose flavor corresponds to the ability they want, that ability will automatically become a favored ability regardless of the brand of their gear.",
    "Some abilities can only appear as primary abilities. These abilities are also tied to a certain type of gear (head, clothes, or shoes), making primary-only abilities on the same gear type mutually exclusive (e.g. the user can only have either Object Shredder or Stealth Jump since both are exclusive to the primary ability slot of shoe items) and prevent the user from stacking them (e.g. the user cannot have more than one main of Tenacity since it is exclusive to the primary ability slot of headgear items).",
    "The groups of mutually exclusive abilities are as follows:",
    "In addition to their primary abilities, all pieces of gear have up to three slots for secondary abilities (or sub abilities,[1] casually referred to as \"subs\" by most players), which are stackable and provide 3 AP each.",
    "The number of secondary ability slots that are present by default is equal to the number of stars (rarity) on the gear. If a piece of gear has less than three secondary ability slots, they can be added by Spyke or Murch with a Super Sea Snail (or 30,000 cash at level 20 or above in Splatoon) for each slot. Super sea snails can also be used to pay for all secondary slots to be rerolled.",
    "All gear comes with empty secondary ability slots (unless obtained via ordering from another player via Spyke or Murch, which has a chance of inheriting the original gear's filled secondary ability slots). Secondary abilities on a piece of gear are obtained by getting experience points from online battles (except for Private Battles) while that gear is equipped. Higher rarity gear requires more points per slot, and each progressive secondary ability on the same gear requires more points to obtain than the previous secondary ability. In Splatoon 2, having a drink from Crust Bucket actively increases gear experience points awarded by 50%, and while the Splatfests were occurring, the Splatfest Tee instead required 7,500 points per slot for a total of 22,500 points.",
    "The following tables show the amount of gear experience required to obtain a secondary ability on a gear item of a given rarity. Numbers denoted with asterisks (*) represent secondary ability slots that must be added by Spyke or Murch.",
    "In Splatoon 2, the player can alternatively apply ability chunks (which are specific to each secondary ability) to add or overwrite a secondary ability via Murch. Unless there are no remaining empty secondary ability slots after adding a secondary ability, adding abilities this way retains the previous amount of gear experience points. The required amount of chunks per slot depends on the number of existing copies of the desired secondary ability on one gear. The primary ability is not counted for this calculation. The amounts are:",
    "For example, a gear with three secondary ability slots has one Run Speed Up and one Swim Speed Up as its secondary abilities.",
    "In Splatoon, there are 13 possible secondary abilities; in Splatoon 2, there are 14. Gear brands that affect roll probability have a ×5 chance of rolling its favored ability and a ×0.5 chance of rolling its unfavored ability. Secondary abilities are assigned using random number generation.",
    "In Splatoon 2, drink tickets affect the probability of receiving a specific secondary ability when enough gear experience points are obtained after an online match. Drink tickets do not affect Murch's rerolling, unlike gear brands.[2]",
    "Here are some examples to help with interpreting the table:",
    "In Splatoon 2, the Aloha Shirt's brand is Forge which is a favoring brand as it favors Special Power Up, unfavors Ink Saver (Sub), and is neutral towards all other abilities.",
    "Gear with a non-favoring brand has an equal probability of rolling any specific rollable ability. For example, in Splatoon 2, the Armor Jacket Replica has the Cuttlegear brand, which does not favor any ability.",
    "Players can use more of an ability (stacking an ability) to achieve stronger effects. For exact details on the effects of stacking each gear ability, see the ability's article.",
    "In general, the more a specific ability is stacked, the less additional effect is accumulated. The degree to which this occurs depends on the ability. To demonstrate this concept, the following charts show the stacking effects for some abilities. Note the diminishing returns as more of the same ability is used.",
    "Spyke, who can be found in an alleyway in Inkopolis Plaza, offers to increase the number of secondary gear ability slots (to a maximum of three slots) or reroll secondary abilities in exchange for a Super Sea Snail (or 30,000 cash if the player is at level 20 or above and has no Super Sea Snails).",
    "Some abilities do not affect certain things, and in-game descriptions do not inform players of these exceptions. For example, Bomb Range Up does not affect some bombs. Another notable example is that Run Speed Up does not affect the run speed while pushing a roller.",
    "Murch, who can be found in Inkopolis Square, has multiple services that can affect a gear item's secondary abilities:",
    "If an occupied slot is overwritten, one ability chunk of the overwritten ability will be provided.",
    "The number of secondary gear abilities already on the gear that match the desired secondary ability is used to determine the cost.",
    "The following abilities were once present in the game but were later removed or replaced:",
    "In version 4.3.0, the following ability replacements took place:",
    "Per the Splatoon 3 Splatfest World Premiere, the abilities listed below feature in the game. Bomb Defense Up DX and Main Power Up do not return[4], being superseded by Sub Resistance Up and Intensify Action respectively.",
    "New to Splatoon 3, Murch can replace the primary ability of a piece of gear for 45 ability chunks. This also gives the player 6 chunks of the replaced ability. Installing primary slot-only abilities requires 15 and gives 2 chunks of three specific abilities (for a total of 45 and 6 chunks, respectively). For the Splatfest Tee, the installation cost is reduced to 6 chunks (for non-exclusive abilities) or 2 chunks of three abilities (for primary slot-only abilities).",
