    "The Painbrush is a main weapon in Splatoon 3, manufactured by Nouveau. It is a brush with higher power and range than other weapons in its class.",
    "The Painbrush resembles a fan brush with a slit in its bristles. Its silver, metallic handle resembles a palette cup. On the handle near the bristles, the Nouveau logo can be seen, colored white. The ring separating the handle from the rest of the weapon changes color matching user's color. The handle is made of wood.",
    "The Painbrush was revealed on 16 May 2023 in the Sizzle Season 2023 trailer[1] and was released on 1 June 2023. Its kit consists of Curling Bomb and Wave Breaker.",
    "As a brush, when  is pressed, it rapidly flicks splashes of ink in front of the user with higher damage and longer range compared with other brushes, but as a tradeoff it possesses a long windup on the first of a series of swings and a narrower spread of ink left on surfaces with each swing. If  is held, the user will push the Painbrush along the ground, leaving a trail of ink as the user runs at a fast speed comparable to that of the Octobrush, but with a wider ink trail.",
    "[2][3]",
    "If you like brushes but wish they had a bit more range and power, then you've got to experience the Painbrush for yourself! It's all thanks to a unique 90 degree rotation by the brush head, giving this weapon the most range of ANY brush out there. The trade-off is that each swing is a bit slower, but this is still a brush we're talking about. You'll be flying across the map, and you can use Curling Bomb to blaze your path. Add in the Wave Breaker special to light up your enemies, and you've got a potent set designed for speed and extreme range!",
    "And here it is in action! Note how the first swing is slow, but subsequent swings fling ink fast and wide. Plus, you can hold down the  Button to advance quickly as needed. If battling is an art, this brush could be... an art tool? IDK. We're scientists, not artists.",

    "Painbrush is a combination of the words pain, referencing the high damage of the weapon, and brush while also being a pun on paintbrush.",
