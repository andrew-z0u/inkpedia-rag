    "The Herobrush Replica is a main weapon in Splatoon 2.",
    "The Herobrush Replica shares its overall design with the Octobrush. However, the Herobrush Replica has a mainly black handle with lime and blue highlights instead of a brown handle with highlights that match the user's ink color. The Herobrush Replica also has darker bristles.",
    "The Herobrush Replica is visually identical to the Level 1 Herobrush but is simply a re-skinned Octobrush. Therefore, unlike the switchable sub weapons of the Herobrush, it comes with Autobombs and the Inkjet. To unlock the Herobrush Replica, the player must complete every level with the Herobrush in Octo Canyon, in which it becomes available for purchase at Ammo Knights.",
    "[1][2]",
    "The Herobrush Replica is a different design of the standard Octobrush model with the same stats. This weapon came about after I made a breakthrough in my research and managed to create the ultimate weapon! Sadly, it never made it to mass production because the guys at the factory couldn't wrap their heads around my advanced schematics... So instead they just slapped some shiny parts on a standard Octobrush and called it the Herobrush Replica. Give it a swing!",
