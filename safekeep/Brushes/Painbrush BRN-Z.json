    "The Painbrush BRN-Z is a main weapon in Splatoon 3. It is a Barazushi-branded variant of the Painbrush.",
    "The Painbrush BRN-Z looks similar to the Painbrush, however it has dark grey bristles and a bronze composition with traces of characteristic green copper patina. Whitish text is stamped under the joint of the swiveling brush head in a hyphenated format, possibly resembling a serial number. A packet resembling a field ration packet stamped with Barazushi's logo is attached to the side of the weapon, and the small ring separating the handle from the rest of the weapon is a dark green. This small ring never changes color to match the user's ink, unlike the original Painbrush.",
    "The Painbrush BRN-Z was added as part of the Splatlands Collection on 12 June 2025. It comes with the Splash Wall sub and Trizooka special weapon.",
    "[1][2]",
    "The Painbrush BRN-Z from Barazushi features a stunning bronze design, but this is not a weapon that's willing to accept third place! With the Splash Wall sub weapon to stake out a safe spot and the Trizooka special to add range and power, this loadout is well-balanced and reliable. If you can patiently wait for the right moment to turn the tables all at once, I'd recommend that you give this set a try!",
    "The suffix \"BRN-Z\" is a stylized spelling of the word bronze, referencing the weapon's design.",
