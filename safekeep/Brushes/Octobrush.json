    "The Octobrush is a main weapon in the Splatoon series.",
    "Classified as a brush, when  is pressed, it flicks weak, short-ranged ink in front of the user, which can be done repeatedly at a fast rate to ink turf or splat opponents. If  is held while moving, the user pushes the Octobrush along the ground, leaving a thin trail of ink as the user runs at a fast speed.",
    "Compared to the Inkbrush, the Octobrush has a slightly wider ink trail when running and more range, damage, and painted turf with each swing than the Inkbrush at the cost of higher ink consumption and slower movement and swing speed.",
    "The Octobrush's handle is dark brown varnished wood with an antique look, with a small octopus-shaped ink reservoir carved out of it. The wood is more smooth and varnished in Splatoon 3, prior to that it is rougher and darker. The ink reservoir has a tube that changes color to match the user's ink attached to its head, leading to the bristles. The way the handle is carved gives the appearance of the octopus holding the brush's handle, while the actual handle used by the wielder is attached underneath it, and has a gold cap. Like the Inkbrush, the Octobrush has an ink splotch on the end of its bristles that changes color to match the user's ink, and disappears while the wielder is out of ink. Unlike the Inkbrush, the Octobrush's bristles are white and arranged in a flat rectangular shape.",
    "The Octobrush was released on 18 July 2015 at 02:00 UTC,[1] under the roller class. It comes in a set with Squid Beakons and the Kraken.",
    "The Octobrush has a critical damage mechanic, allowing it to sometimes splat opponents in two hits.[2] The likelihood of this can be increased by using Damage Up.",
    "[3]",
    "The Octobrush is a brush with denser bristles that fling even more ink with each swipe! Use that mobility to scatter Squid Beakons everywhere, giving your whole team free rein of the battlefield! No need to hesitate - you can always use the Kraken to run away in a pinch. Your team will love you!(NA)",
    "The Octobrush returns in Splatoon 2 with Autobombs and the Inkjet. The Herobrush Replica has the same kit as the Octobrush.",
    "The critical damage mechanic was removed in Splatoon 2, so it always takes three or more hits to splat an opponent.",
    "It appears in seven Octo Expansion stations:",
    "[4][5]",
    "The Octobrush is a brush with dense bristles that fling a thick stream of ink with each swipe! The Autobomb sub weapon allows you to sweep areas you can't see, allowing you to push forward with confidence! Faraway enemies aren't safe either with an Inkjet on your side. Easy to use, this brush set is great for brushing up on your skills!",
    "The Octobrush returns in Splatoon 3, now classified as a separate brush class. Its kit is Suction Bombs and the Zipcaster. Its wood is more saturated and slightly lighter, and with a new golden tip at the bottom of the brush.",
    "It appears in four missions in Return of the Mammalians:",
    "[6][7]",
    "The Octobrush has dense bristles that fling a thick stream of ink with each slash. It's a heavier entry in the brush weapon class, which is known for being light and nimble. But even with those heavy brush strokes, you won't be able to reach everywhere - and that's where the Suction Bombs come in. Lastly, if you're up against enemies with ranged weapons who just won't engage up close, you've got the Zipcaster in your back pocket. Zip on over and give 'em what for! This is a user-friendly loadout that's easy for beginner brushes but capable enough for true artistes!",
    "For competitive tips about the Octobrush",
    "Octobrush is a combination of \"octo (Latin for \"eight\"; likely referring the octopus-shaped ink reservoir) and brush.",
    "Additionally, when taken alongside the name of its fellow brush-class weapon, the Inkbrush, it may be meant to reflect the name of Octolings.",
