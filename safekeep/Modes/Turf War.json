    "Turf War​",
    "Turf War is a mode in the Splatoon series. It is the only playable mode for Regular Battles and Splatfest Battles. Players must ink the most turf to win the match and are split into two teams of up to four.",
    "Turf War was announced alongside Splatoon at E3 2014. It was the only complete mode for people to test out at the time, as only 10% of the game was done at that point in time.[2]",
    "Turf War is played by up to eight people, each on their own console. There are two teams of up to four players each, with each team assigned its own ink color. The main objective for each team is to cover as much of the stage, as displayed on the overhead Turf Map, as they can. Players may attempt to splat each other as well to temporarily avoid resistance or for defense. Each team has three minutes to spread ink around the stage. After the timer reaches 0, Judd calculates how much of the stage was covered by each team. The team with the highest percentage of turf coverage wins the round. A bonus 1000p (300p before the final Splatfest of Splatoon) is awarded to the winning team.",
    "In Splatoon, stages rotate out every four hours along with the stages from Ranked Battle, at  02:00 UTC,  06:00 UTC,  10:00 UTC,  14:00 UTC,  18:00 UTC,  22:00 UTC. The change in stages is accompanied by an announcement by the Squid Sisters. This announcement also ejects all players out of all lobbies after they finish their current match.",
    "In Splatoon 2, stages rotate out every two hours along with the stages from Ranked Battle, at  00:00 UTC, 02:00 UTC,  04:00 UTC,  06:00 UTC,  08:00 UTC,  10:00 UTC,  12:00 UTC,  14:00 UTC,  16:00 UTC,  18:00 UTC,  20:00 UTC,  22:00 UTC. The change in stages is only accompanied by an announcement by Off the Hook when there is either a new game update, a Splatfest-related announcement, or a change in Salmon Run status. This announcement also ejects all players out of all lobbies after they finish their current match. This is the same in Splatoon 3, with the exception of the announcements being given by Deep Cut.",
    "Like in Splatoon 2, stages in Splatoon 3 rotate out every two hours along with the stages from Anarchy Battle. The change in stages is not accompanied by an announcement by Deep Cut unless there is an ongoing Splatfest. In case of an event announcement, the stage schedule can be skipped afterwards. Players are still ejected out of their lobbies after a new rotation.",
    "The player should mainly ink horizontal surfaces because walls and other vertical surfaces do not add to the team's score. Walls should only be inked to get up to high places. In certain maps, climbable objects are the main vantage point for both teams, allowing players to spray ink further while forcing the opposing team back, mostly useful with chargers and other long-range types.",
    "Similarly, moving stage elements (such as the spinning platforms in Museum d'Alfonsino and the conveyor belts in Piranha Pit) are scored as they appear at the end of the match.",
    "A quick way for players to be able to see who is currently in the lead is to refer to the squid and octopus icons at the top of the screen. As well as displaying player status (active, splatted/disconnected, or not present), if one team is at least 10% ahead of the other team, their icons will appear larger. A \"Danger!\" icon also appears over a team's icons when the corresponding team is at least 10% coverage behind.",
    "Splatoon 2's 5.0.0 update added the Turf War (Splatfest) option to Private Battles. When this mode is selected, all twenty-four variations of Shifty Station are available to be selected as battle stages, ink colors from any Splatfest in Splatoon 2 across all regions can be selected (save for the combinations from Raph vs. Donnie, Hello Kitty vs. My Melody, and Super Mushroom vs. Super Star), and stage music and visuals are modified to match those of a Splatfest. Additionally, if a participating player is wearing the Splatfest Tee Replica, their team's Splatfest team name will display during the match opening.",
    "In Splatoon 3, winning a certain amount of battles will reward the player with special badges that they can use on their Splashtag.",

    "- If a Turf War ends in a tie, 0.1% will be added to the team assigned as Alpha in Splatoon, therefore making a tie impossible. The game randomly decides which teams are Alpha and Bravo for each match, but the host in Private Battles has the ability to assign players to either side.",
    "- In Splatoon and Splatoon 2, spawn points are automatically covered in each team's ink, amounting to a minimum score of 6p for each team. Since spawn points do not exist on the map in Splatoon 3, it is possible to gain a 0p score for both teams."
