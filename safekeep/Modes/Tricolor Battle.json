    "Tricolor Battle is a mode available exclusively during Splatfest events in Splatoon 3, alongside Splatfest Battle.",
    "During Splatfests, it is unlocked halfway through each Splatfest event, right after the Halftime Report.",
    "Tricolor Turf Wars were revealed via the Splatoon 3 Direct on 10 August 2022. The Tricolor Battle mode was first available in the Splatoon 3 Splatfest World Premiere demo with the Rock vs. Paper vs. Scissors event.",
    "The mode was overhauled in the version 2.0.0 update, splitting its result category from Splatfest Battle (Open).",
    "In Splatoon 3, Tricolor Battle is a new mode exclusive to Splatfests alongside the returning Splatfest Battle mode. Splatfest Battle (Open) and Splatfest Battle (Pro) are available for the entirety of the Splatfest, while Tricolor Battle is only available after the Halftime Report, where the leading team is announced.",
    "Players that enter Tricolor Battle will play a Tricolor Turf War match, wherein all players from all three Splatfest teams are arranged into 2v4v2 teams. Members of the two teams that consist of two players each are called attackers, while members of the team that consists of four players are called defenders. Teams are randomly assigned as attacking or defending in each individual match; if the team revealed to be in the lead during the Halftime Report is randomly chosen as the defending team during a match, the winning team will receive a 1.5× clout bonus.",
    "As of version 2.0.0, clout accumulated via Tricolor Battle is a category taken into account when calculating a Splatfest's final results.",
    "During the Splatoon 3 Splatfest World Premiere and from version 1.1.0 until version 2.0.0, affecting the Splatfest events Rock vs. Paper vs. Scissors, Gear vs. Grub vs. Fun and Grass vs. Fire vs. Water, the Tricolor Battle menu option was only available to members of the second and third-place teams, where they were guaranteed to be on the attacking teams. Members of the leading team could be randomly placed in a Tricolor Turf War match when participating in the Splatfest Battle (Open) mode, where they would always be on the defending team. Players on the leading team could not be matched into Tricolor Turf Wars if they selected the Splatfest Battle (Pro) mode.",
    "Under this system, clout accumulated via Tricolor Turf War wins counted towards the Splatfest Battle (Open) results category.",
    "The version 2.0.0 update made it so Tricolor Battle is a menu option available to all players regardless of chosen team, randomizing the assignment of attacking and defending teams per match. Additionally, Tricolor clout was added as a results category. In certain localizations, the mode's name was changed to reflect the new system.",
    "The pool of music tracks that can play during Splatfest Battles is shared with Tricolor Battle.",
    "During the second part of the Grand Festival, the track Rainbow Color Inkantation with its unique handling of the last-minute song exclusively played on Grand Splatlands Bowl Tricolor Turf War matches; no other typical Splatfest tracks could play on this map.",
