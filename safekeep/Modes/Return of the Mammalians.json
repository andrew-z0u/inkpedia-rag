    "Return of the Mammalians​",
    "Return of the Mammalians is a single-player game mode in Splatoon 3. It involves the player donning a Hero Suit and venturing into the Crater to defeat the Octarian army (which is now covered in hair), soon ending up in Alterna.",
    "An Inkling or Octoling and their buddy Smallfry arrive in Splatsville, where Shiver, Frye, and Big Man of Deep Cut report in a special Anarchy Splatcast broadcast that the Great Zapfish that powers the city has gone missing. The Inkling or Octoling goes through a manhole leading to the Crater, where they meet Craig Cuttlefish. He recruits them as the new Agent 3 of the New Squidbeak Splatoon and gives them a Hero Suit, enlisting them to rescue the Great Zapfish from the Octarians, who stole it twice before.",
    "Agent 3 progresses through the Crater, rescuing Zapfish from the Octarians and clearing away Fuzzy Ooze by powering up Smallfry with Power Eggs. Along the way, Cuttlefish notices that the Octarians are now fuzzy and tries to contact Agent 1 and Agent 2 to provide backup. DJ Octavio intervenes in the communication, but Cuttlefish dismisses it as his radio being broken.",
    "When Agent 3 reaches the center of the Crater, DJ Octavio appears in his battle mech, the Octobot King L3.Gs, and accuses Cuttlefish of being behind the disappearance of his Octarian troops. After Agent 3 defeats him in battle, Cuttlefish taunts him for being easy to defeat, as though he was not using the Great Zapfish's power. However, Octavio then reveals that he did not steal the Great Zapfish this time, to Cuttlefish's shock. Suddenly, the ground beneath them collapses as Fuzzy Ooze flows out. A tentacle-shaped piece of Fuzzy Ooze takes Cuttlefish away from Agent 3, who loses their Hero Suit and Power Eggs in the fall. Meanwhile, Deep Cut watches from above.",
    "Agent 3 wakes up in the mysterious location of Alterna, where they are greeted by the New Squidbeak Splatoon, comprised of the Squid Sisters (Agents 1 and 2) and the Captain (the former Agent 3). They explain to Agent 3 that Alterna, which is also full of Fuzzy Ooze, consists of six sites, as well as a large rocket. Three of the sites are emitting strong signals that they suspect come from a tracking device they placed on Cuttlefish. Agent 3 is tasked with investigating these three areas in order to find Cuttlefish.",
    "Agent 3 progresses through Alterna, continuing to remove Fuzzy Ooze along the way. In order to get enough Power Eggs to do this, they complete missions set by an AI known as O.R.C.A.",
    "As Agent 3 reaches the end of the first site, Future Utopia Island, Deep Cut suddenly appears. The three of them introduce themselves, revealing that they are actually bandits and declaring that the Splatlands are their turf and all the treasure in Alterna belongs to them, before departing.",
    "Agent 3 visits each of the three locations that are emitting signals. Each time, they encounter one of the three members of Deep Cut and defeat them in battle, only to find that the signal was coming from the treasure they were guarding, which Agent 3 takes. After the first treasure is collected, Cuttlefish manages to make contact with Agents 1 and 2 and reveals that he is locked in a dark room. After the second treasure is collected, he briefly makes contact again, until he is confronted by his unseen captor, Mr. Grizz. After the third treasure is collected, Cuttlefish makes contact again and deduces from his aching knee that he is high up before Mr. Grizz cuts him off.",
    "Agents 1 and 2 deduce that Cuttlefish is in the rocket, which they cannot reach due to the Fuzzy Ooze surrounding it. They assemble the treasures into a large tool, which the Captain uses to remove the Fuzzy Ooze, allowing the team to proceed to the Alterna Space Center, though the Captain ends up hurt from using the tool. Soon after this, Deep Cut appears again, trying to take back the treasure, but to their surprise, Agent 2 agrees to let them have it. Regretting their hostility, Deep Cut apologize and ask Agent 2 to be their boss, who reluctantly accepts.",
    "Agent 3 makes their way up the rocket. On their way, they overhear Mr. Grizz talking to Cuttlefish about his plans to use Golden Eggs (collected by his unwitting employees at Grizzco Industries) to \"restore the balance of the world\". Agent 1 also asks Deep Cut about their reason for hunting treasures, and they explain that they sell the treasure to help those in need in Splatsville while leaving little for themselves, which makes Agents 1 and 2 respect them. Agent 3 also passes by the Great Zapfish trapped in a container in the rocket.",
    "As Agent 3 nears the top of the rocket, they overhear Mr. Grizz attacking Cuttlefish, claiming his brain contains the \"beautiful essence\" he needs. At the top, Agents 1, 2 and 3 find Cuttlefish dried up and lifeless as a result of being dehydrated by Mr. Grizz, who finally confronts them, revealing him to be a grizzly bear. The Captain arrives, and soon afterwards Mr. Grizz escapes on the rocket as it takes off, announcing his intention to spread Fuzzy Ooze all over the planet and bring forth a new era of mammalian dominance.",
    "The Captain sheds a tear on Cuttlefish's body, which moistens him enough to awaken him, albeit still with his dried-up appearance. Deep Cut helps Agent 3 and Smallfry reach the rocket in space, where they fight Mr. Grizz. After having the Fuzzballs on his body splatted, Mr. Grizz knocks Agent 3 and Smallfry off of the rocket as he absorbs the Fuzzy Ooze and plans to unleash it on Earth himself. However, DJ Octavio flies in with his Octobot King to save them, wanting to help stop Mr. Grizz's plan. He, the Squid Sisters, and Deep Cut then perform Calamari Inkantation 3MIX together, and Smallfry becomes Hugefry. In the final battle, Hugefry fights Mr. Grizz as DJ Octavio and Agent 3 vacuum the Fuzzballs on his body. After vacuuming all of the Fuzzballs, they fire the fuzz back at him, defeating him in a large explosion. Smallfry returns to normal and joins DJ Octavio and Agent 3 as they return to Earth.",
    "In an Anarchy Splatcast broadcast, Deep Cut reports that the Great Zapfish has returned to Splatsville and that the Squid Sisters have released a new single, Wave Goodbye. After realizing that Agents 1 and 2 are in fact the Squid Sisters, they set aside their disdain for the Squid Sisters and play the song. When Agent 3 returns to Alterna, they are congratulated by Agents 1 and 2, Cuttlefish, and the Captain for saving the world.",
    "Compared to the Hero Mode of the previous two games, Return of the Mammalians has a less linear progression similar to the Octo Expansion. When the player enters a mission, O.R.C.A. explains the premise of the level with dialogue and prompts the player to select one of the sets of weapons available. Different sets of weapons may have different Power Eggs rewards. Some missions also cost Power Eggs to play, and/or have special conditions that will cause the player to get splatted if they fail.",
    "The areas in this mode are covered in Fuzzy Ooze, which serves as the obstacle blocking the path to other areas, rather than having the missions locked themselves. The player needs to use the Power Eggs they collect from the missions to clear them and progress.",
    "The map screen in each of the sites tracks how many of each type of item the player has found on the overworld (loot anchors that contain decorations, golden records, Sardinium, and Sunken Scrolls). The map highlights areas with unobtained items to find in green, labeled as Areas of Interest, whereas it marks areas which the player has not been to yet with black striped squares labeled Parts Unknown. If the player fully collects all items in a site and goes to every possible part of the map so that there are no longer any black squares, the site becomes marked as \"Surveyed\". Marie will award the player with a piece of the map of Alterna as a sticker if they survey that site.",
    "Fully surveying all sites causes a Shel-drone to appear. Each day the player can charge this drone by using 999 power eggs. The following day, the drone will send an item to the lobby terminal. These items include cash, ability chunks, and meal tickets, as well as decorations that can only be found in Alterna. This is currently the only way to get duplicates of these decorations. If the Shel-drone does not appear after the player surveys every area, they will need to go back to Splatsville, and then Alterna again.",
