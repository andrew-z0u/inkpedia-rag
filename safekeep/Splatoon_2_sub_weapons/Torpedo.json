    "The Torpedo is a sub weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3. It is a flying projectile that automatically targets opponents and explodes on impact, but can be shot down.",
    "The Torpedo is a clear plastic ink canister with a resealable nozzle.",
    "The expanded Torpedo is designed after single-use soy sauce packets shaped like sea breams, popularized by Kikkoman. The weapon's front is shaped like the resealable nozzle of these packets, and its body has fish scales, fins, and eyes. The bottom of the pre-expansion projectile has a black circle which transforms into a propeller when the weapon activates.",
    "It is a bomb-type weapon which, when thrown near an enemy, changes shape and targets the foe, exploding on impact and spraying ink around the explosion. Torpedoes thrown by opponents can be shot down with attacks by dealing 20 points of damage to them.",
    "After being thrown, ink is spread below the player's feet. While still in the air, if an enemy is near the Torpedo it will stop in midair and change forms. After fully expanding it will slowly launch forward, ultimately exploding when touching the enemy or a wall or floor. The explosion will also spread droplets which do additional damage. A dashed circle will appear around the enemy being targeted, similar to the target markers for Tenta Missiles.",
    "Torpedo's locked form works similar to Splash Wall in matters of lethal bombs. They explode immediately, which can be disastrous if the thrower or a teammate is too close to the Torpedo.",
    "A direct hit from the Torpedo's explosion will deal 60 damage while the droplets will deal an additional 12 damage each. The droplets can hit up to three times, capping the damage at 96. The explosion's inking range is slightly larger than a Suction Bomb's, and the droplets will also ink the ground.",
    "If a player attempts to throw a second torpedo while the first one is still active, a \"Can't Use\" prompt will appear, preventing them from using it. Therefore, Ink Saver (Sub) cannot be used to throw two, so the ability has minimal use outside of conserving their ink.",
    "If the Torpedo touches any surface (floor, wall, grate, etc.), or does not find a target, it will not activate its second stage and will explode much like a Splat Bomb or an unshaken Fizzy Bomb, only dealing the base explosion's damage and not spreading droplets. In this case, the explosion's painting range is also much smaller.",
    "The Torpedo was first teased in 31 October 2018 by official Nintendo social media. [1]. It was added to the game on 7 November 2018 as part of the 4.2.0 update.",
    "When thrown near an enemy, it changes shape and targets the foe, exploding on impact and splatting ink everywhere.",
    "You can shoot down enemy torpedoes.",
    "The Torpedo returns in Splatoon 3.",
