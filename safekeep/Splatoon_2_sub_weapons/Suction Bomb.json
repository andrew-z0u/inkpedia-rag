    "The Suction Bomb is a sub weapon in the Splatoon series. Suction Bombs can be thrown and attach to virtually any surface, including walls and ceilings. After two seconds, they explode in a burst of ink, covering area.",
    "Suction Bombs bear a strong resemblance to a can of spray paint, but with a black suction cup connected to the nozzle. The can matches the user's ink color, and the small dots change color too. The can also has two white dots with black dots inside of them, representing eyes. The body of the bomb has some Inkling text on it.",
    "Throwing a Suction Bomb costs 70% of the player's ink tank under normal circumstances, just like the Splat Bomb. It will also immediately explode upon contact with the Rainmaker's shield or a Splash Wall.",
    "The main differences between the Splat Bomb and Suction Bomb are as follows.",
    "As Suction Bombs can be used to herd an opponent into a vulnerable position, it is important to be able to continue firing after using the bomb and fully capitalize on the battlefield control provided by the Suction Bomb. The 70% ink consumed by the Suction Bomb makes it desirable to use the ink management abilities Ink Saver (Main) and Ink Saver (Sub). The charts below show the combinations needed to achieve particular shot counts after using a Suction Bomb. Alternatively, a combination of Ink Recovery Up and Ink Saver (Sub) is useful if the player just wants to throw more bombs, as opposed to throwing a bomb and then using the main weapon. After deploying a Suction Bomb, there is a 1 second delay before ink can be refilled again. With 3 mains and 2 subs of Ink Saver (Sub), 2 Suction Bombs may be deployed with one full ink tank.",
    "The Suction Bomb returns in Splatoon 2.",
    "It takes longer to explode than a Splat Bomb, but it has a larger blast radius.",
    "The Suction Bomb returns in Splatoon 3. It was first shown in the Release Date Revealed trailer.",
    "Suction Bomb appears in Side Order as the base sub weapon of Big Man's Palette. They also appear as a purchasable sub weapon on Vending-Machine Corner Floors, costing 500 Membux by default.",

    "- Splat Bombs have a radius of roughly 0.75 lines for dealing 180.0 damage and beyond that another 0.75 lines for dealing 30.0 damage (total radius is 1.5 lines for damage).
