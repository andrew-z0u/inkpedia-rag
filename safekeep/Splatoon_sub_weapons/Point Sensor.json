    "Point Sensor is a sub weapon in the Splatoon series. It is a thrown device that produces an area of effect on impact that marks opponents.",
    "Point Sensors are black, cube-like objects with cylinder-shaped protrusions that change color to match the user's ink. The sides of the Point Sensor have dark blue panels on them, and two similar panels stick out of the bottom. Once thrown, the Point Sensor explodes in a cloud that is black and the same color as the user's ink, and some black arrows surround the area where the Point Sensor was thrown. Enemies tagged by the Point Sensor are encircled by a similar arrow and tied to members of the Point Sensor user's team with a line of the user's ink color, although each line is only visible to the member it leads to.",
    "When thrown, they explode in a spherical cloud that has the color of the player's ink and tag any enemy Inkling in a certain range with a swirling squid marker. This marker allows tagged enemies to be seen through barriers by all teammates, allowing them to be easily tracked.",
    "In Splatoon 2, Point Sensors have an area of effect that lasts 2.5 seconds. Any player that enters the area of effect during that time is tracked.",
    "This will reveal their location to every member of your team.",
    "Point Sensors return in Splatoon 3, with attributes identical to those in the previous game.",

    "- It tracks an enemy for eight seconds normally or two seconds if the target has Cold Blooded. Before version 2.2.0, it would normally track for ten seconds or 2.5 seconds with Cold Blooded.[1] Due to lag and other factors, the exact time may vary slightly during online play.",
    "- With no Ink Saver (Sub), it requires 40% of maximum ink tank capacity.",
    "- Upon hitting a surface, the blast radius is roughly 3 lines in diameter, 1.5 in radius. Pre-version 2.2.0, it was about 2.5 lines in diameter and 1.25 in radius.",
    "- Throw distance can be increased with Bomb Range Up.",
    "- Can be thrown against a wall to track enemies on the other side, as long as they are within the blast radius.",

    "- The total amount of time a player is tracked can change depending on when the player enters the Point Sensor's area of effect. On a direct hit, the tracking time lasts the full eight seconds, while entering the area of effect afterwards reduces the tracking length by the amount of time since the point sensor landed.\nFor example: if a player walks into the area of effect two seconds after the Point Sensor lands, the player is marked for a total of six seconds instead of eight seconds.",
    "- Players hit by multiple Point Sensors from different opponents are marked concurrently. Assists are awarded to both Point Sensor users if the tracked player dies to another opponent or if they jump off the stage.",
    "- Players can be repeatedly marked by a Point Sensor to effectively reset the remaining tracking time back to eight seconds.",
    "- The base total tracking time can be increased from eight seconds to a maximum of sixteen seconds using Sub Power Up.",
    "- Bomb Defense Up DX reduces the tracking time of the Point Sensor by a percentage of the maximum tracking time.\nFor example: if a player wears enough Bomb Defense Up DX to reduce the tracking time by 50%; an eight-second Point Sensor is reduced to four seconds while a Sub Power Up-boosted sixteen-second Point Sensor reduces its tracking time to eight seconds for that player.",
