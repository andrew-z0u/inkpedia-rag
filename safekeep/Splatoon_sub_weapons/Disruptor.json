    "The Disruptor appears to be a liquid substance that changes color to match the user's ink stored in a glass vial. The vial itself has a long, thin neck, a round bottom, and a black cork. The Nouveau logo is etched on the glass. There is a metal handle with a black grip connected to the vial by some dark blue supports.

When a player is tagged by a Disruptor, some black squids begin to swirl around them, leaving small purple trails.",
