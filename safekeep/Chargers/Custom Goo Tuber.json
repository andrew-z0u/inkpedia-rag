    "The Custom Goo Tuber is a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3. It is a Custom-branded version of the Goo Tuber.",
    "This weapon can hold a charge for an exceptionally long time in comparison to other chargers, being able to hold a charge for five seconds as opposed to other chargers which only last one second. This allows players to get to a better vantage point or sneak up on enemies with a full charge. The weapon also bears the ability to store incomplete charges. Its charging time takes slightly longer than a Splat Charger, and the range is slightly shorter. Each fully charged shot consumes 15% of the ink tank, allowing users to fire six shots before needing to refill.",
    "The Custom Goo Tuber is nearly identical in appearance to the Goo Tuber. The only difference between the two is that the Custom Goo Tuber has a sticker bearing the Custom logo stuck on the pump.",
    "In Splatoon 3, the color of the Custom Goo Tuber's pump has been changed from orange to light blue.",
    "The Custom Goo Tuber was released on 9 February 2018 at 02:00 UTC.[1] It comes with Curling Bombs and the Inkjet.",
    "[2]",
    "The Custom Goo Tuber retains the charm and features of the  original but has a fresh new look! You get the Goo Tuber's extended charged storage and mobility, but also the dynamic reach of Curling Bombs as a sub! Opponents bringing the pressure? Get airborne with the Inkjet and make 'em wish they'd stayed in bed. Become a master of the charged shot while wielding your influence on the map, and you'll be unstoppable!",
    "The Custom Goo Tuber returns in Splatoon 3 as part of the Drizzle Season 2023. Its design is slightly updated, with its tank now being light blue. Its set consists of Fizzy Bomb and Ultra Stamp. It now has two rings of charge.",
    "[3][4]",
    "The Custom Goo Tuber has that classic Goo Tuber performance but with a fresh new look and a new loadout that can really shake up your strategy! For example, when you use Fizzy Bombs to ink a path forward, you can load up a stored charge and blast ahead. Enemies corner you while you're on the offensive? You've got the Ultra Stamp special in your back pocket! It's so satisfying to turn the tables like that... And remember—stored charges are great, but this weapon still packs a punch on a partial charge. Don't be shy with that trigger button!",
