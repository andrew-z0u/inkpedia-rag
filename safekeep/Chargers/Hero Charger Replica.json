    "The Hero Charger Replica is a main weapon in Splatoon and Splatoon 2.",
    "In both games, the Hero Charger Replica is identical in appearance to the Hero Charger. In Splatoon 2, it is identical to the Level 1 Hero Charger.",
    "The Hero Charger is not available during regular Octo Valley missions but can be used at the amiibo stand in Inkopolis Plaza with an Inkling Girl amiibo. When using this amiibo, the player is given the chance to go through some of the previous Octo Valley levels that they have beaten and replay them using a charger rather than a shooter.",
    "Visually, it is based on the Hero Charger found in Octo Valley, but stats-wise it is identical to the Splat Charger.",
    "When the blueprints are obtained and given to Sheldon in Ammo Knights, he gives the player the Hero Charger Replica as he cannot copy the technology shown on the blueprints. It, therefore, loses the specially-designed Agent 3 Splat Bombs.",
    "The Hero Charger looks slightly similar to the real-life M16 Rifle, an iconic weapon and the standard service rifle for many armies in the world; however, the M16 is an assault rifle rather than a sniper rifle.",
    "The Hero Charger Replica comes with Splat Bombs and the Bomb Rush.",
    "To unlock the Hero Charger Replica, the player must play the last set of missions from the Inkling Girl amiibo:",
    "The blueprints to the Hero Charger Replica are received after completing the fifth boss challenge.",
    "[1]",
    "The Hero Charger Replica returns to Splatoon 2 with an updated model that is visually identical to the Level 1 Hero Charger. However it is once again a re-skinned Splat Charger, which therefore now comes with Splat Bombs and Sting Ray, along with the newfound ability to store a charge for one second. To unlock the Hero Charger Replica, the player must now complete every level with the Hero Charger in Octo Canyon.",
    "[2]",
    "The Hero Charger Replica is an alternate design of the standard Splat Charger model with the same stats and setup. This weapon came about after I made a breakthrough in my research and managed to create the ultimate weapon! Sadly, it never made it to mass production because the guys at the factory couldn't wrap their heads around my advanced schematics... So instead they just slapped some shiny parts on a standard Splat Charger and called it the Hero Charger Replica. Give it a shot!",

    "Note: the strategy advice for Splat Charger also applies to Hero Charger Replica, so they share the same strategy page.",
