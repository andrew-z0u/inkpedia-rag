    "The Order Charger is a charger in Splatoon 3 that is exclusively used in Side Order.",
    "The Order Charger has a minimalist appearance, with a single white molded piece for the barrel and handle of the weapon, as well as a metallic silver ink tank and nozzle. Its appearance is similar to that of a Splat Charger. When firing, ring-shaped holograms manifest around the nozzle and base of the Charger.",
    "The Order Charger is a weapon unlocked in Side Order, and is part of Marie's Palette. Its base set consists of Ink Mines and Triple Inkstrike. However, this can be changed in the Spire of Order by using a vending machine.",
    "It has lower stats in comparison to the Splat Charger, with a slower fire rate, strafe speed, ink efficiency, charge time, range, and is unable to store its charge. However, this can be upgraded through color chips in the Spire of Order.",
