    "The Z+F Splat Charger is a main weapon in Splatoon 3, introduced in Fresh Season 2023. It is a Z+F-branded variant of the Splat Charger, and an unscoped variant of the Z+F Splatterscope. It was teased in the Fresh Season 2023 poster on 16 February 2023 and was officially revealed on Splatoon's Twitter accounts on 20 February 2023. It was released as part of 3.0.0 on 1 March 2023.",
    "It is a rebranded successor of Firefin Splat Charger from Splatoon 2 following the merger between Firefin and Zekko to form Z+F.",
    "[1][2]",
    "The Z+F Splat Charger is a special model of the Splat Charger from trendy gear brand Z+F! Now, that cool brand doesn't make the weapon any more powerful, or anything, but you will get an entirely new loadout to play around with! Take, for example, the Splash Wall. It's a great accessory for a charging weapon because it allows you to take cover while the main weapon, well, charges up! And it comes with the fearsome Triple Inkstrike special! Whether you use it to probe for hiding enemies or holding down the fort, it's a beast. If you want to be THAT charger user, give this set a try.",
