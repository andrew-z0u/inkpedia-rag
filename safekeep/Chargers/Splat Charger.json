    "The Splat Charger is a main weapon in the Splatoon series.",
    "The Splat Charger, like other charger-type weapons, can be charged up before firing. The more it is charged, the farther the ink will go and the more damage it will deal. Only a fully charged shot will splat an enemy in one hit. It also creates a thick line of ink, rather than many small blobs like shooter-class weapons do. This weapon is the most basic form of charger in the Splatoon series, with all-around average performance, and longer range than most weapons (though not the highest in the class). This weapon has a scoped variant.",
    "From Splatoon 2 onwards, this weapon can store a fully charged shot in swim form for a short amount of time, and a fully charged shot will pierce through opponents.",
    "The Splat Charger, like many other chargers, has an ink tank at the back and a long barrel with the handle and trigger situated at the back end of the barrel. The ink tank changes color to match the user's ink. In Splatoon, the handle is yellow, the trigger, nozzle, and the back part of the barrel are red, and there is a large, dark green block in the middle of the barrel, leaving the rest of the barrel white. In Splatoon 2, the Splat Charger's appearance is less blocky and more stylized to fit the rest of the game. The barrel is completely white with some empty purple and green scope mounts, the handle is mainly blueish purple, and there is a green sight mounted to the end of the barrel.",
    "In Splatoon 3, an additional sight is present above the barrel, a pump handle extends behind the trigger, and a blue cap is attached to the back end of the ink tank. The barrel is now completely black, the base is purple, and the trigger, pump, rail and both sights are yellow.",
    "The Splat Charger comes with Splat Bombs and the Bomb Rush.",
    "[1]",
    "The Splat Charger is a Charger-type weapon, designed for long-range offense. Hold down  to charge up ink, and then release to fire it all out at once, inking a long path in an instant! With this weapon type's debut, Turf Wars expanded from mid-range battles to something more complex! With easy-to-use Splat Bombs and Bomb Rush, this is a good set to get used to the charger fighting style!(NA)",
    "The Splat Charger is a Charger-type weapon, designed for long-range offence. Hold down  to build up ink, then release to fire it all out at once, painting a long path in an instant! With this weapon type's debut, Turf Wars expanded from mid-range battles to something more complex! With the easy-to-use Splat Bombs and Bomb Rush, this is a good set to get used to the charger fighting style!(EU/OC)",
    "The Splat Charger returns for Splatoon 2 with a new visual design and a new charge-holding mechanic. The player can now store a charge for one second. It comes in a set with Splat Bombs and Sting Ray.",
    "It appears in fourteen Octo Expansion stations:",
    "[2]",
    "The Splat Charger is a charger-type weapon designed for long-range offense. Hold down  to charge up ink, and then release the button to fire it out all at once, inking a long path in an instant! Sure, it's a bit unwieldy, but this baby can store its charge, allowing you to swim for a short while without losing your charge. The Splat Bombs and Sting Ray that accompany the weapon complement the long-range nature of the charger. This set is a great starting point on your journey to charger mastery!",
    "The Splat Charger returns in Splatoon 3 with a new design. Its kit consists of Splat Bomb and Ink Vac.",
    "It appears in one mission in Return of the Mammalians:",
    "[3][4]",
    "Simply put, the Splat Charger is a charger-type weapon designed for long-range offense. Its operation is standard - hold down  to charge up ink, then release  to fire it out all at once, inking a long path in an instant! Ah, but here's a key difference... the Splat Charger can actually hold its charge for a short period while you swim. Technically speaking, that's a game-changing advantage! And with Splat Bombs to flush out hiding enemies and the Ink Vac to turn the tables on invaders, this set is impressively well-balanced. I recommend it for anyone who's looking to eventually master the charger category of weapons!",

This is a pattern that holds true across all three games, as none of its historical variants have ever returned in subsequent games besides the unbranded, vanilla variant.\nBecause of this, it is also the weapon with the most distinguished variants across the series: if the repeat kits within the same game do not count separately (for example the Order Charger Replica, and the base Splat Charger are counted as one because they both have Splat Bomb and Ink Vac), then the Splat Charger has had 6 variants across the series.",
