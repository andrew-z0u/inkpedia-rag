    "The Splatterscope is a main weapon in the Splatoon series.",
    "The Splatterscope is a Splat Charger with a scope attached. Compared to the scopeless version, it has enhanced range and a zoomed view for greater aiming precision, but players have their field of vision limited by the scope, and it can not store its charge in swim form. Besides all of this, all other stats are the same as the Splat Charger, and it shares its sub and special weapons.",
    "The Splatterscope is nearly identical in appearance to the Splat Charger. The only difference between the two is that the Splatterscope has a scope attached to the back end of the barrel.",
    "The Splatterscope comes with Splat Bombs and the Bomb Rush.",
    "[1]",
    "The Splatterscope is a Splat Charger with an added scope for effective long-distance aiming.\nIt's great for hitting far-off targets, but your view is narrow while charging, so careful where you use it!(NA)",
    "The Splatterscope returns for Splatoon 2, with visual changes. It was not given the charge holding feature that the Splat Charger and other chargers were given. It comes with Splat Bombs and Sting Ray.",
    "It appears in two Octo Expansion stations:",
    "[2]",
    "The Splatterscope is a Splat Charger with an added scope for more effective long-distance aiming. It's great for hitting far-off targets, but your view is narrow while charging, so careful where you use it! Also, that fancy scope there takes up space, so something had to go. In this case, we had to nix the ability to store your charge. But hey, if you like to stay safe and shoot from afar, this could be the charger for you! And the Splat Bombs and Sting Ray make this special scoped model worth a try, eh?",
    "The Splatterscope returns in Splatoon 3 with a new design and has Splat Bomb and Ink Vac, matching the Splat Charger.",
    "It appears in one mission in Return of the Mammalians:",
    "[3][4]",
    "The Splatterscope is a Splat Charger with an added scope for more effective long-distance aiming. It's great for hitting far-off targets, but your view is narrow while charging, so be extra careful! Also, that fancy scope there takes up space, so something had to go. In this case, we had to nix the ability to store your charge. But hey, if you like to stay safe and shoot from afar, this could be the charger for you! When you're not scoping and sniping, you've also got Splat Bombs and the Ink Vac at your disposal, so this is a more balanced set than it would appear. Give it a try!",
