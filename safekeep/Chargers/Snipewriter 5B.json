    "The Snipewriter 5B is a main weapon in Splatoon 3. It is the Nouveau-branded variant of the Snipewriter 5H.",
    "The Snipewriter 5B is similar in design to the Snipewriter 5H. Notable differences are that the drawing compass is red instead of blue and the presence of a sticker of the Nouveau logo placed near the tip of the pencil.",
    "The Snipewriter 5B was first revealed through social media networks on 17 November 2023, and was released on 1 December 2023 as part of the Chill Season 2023 update. Its kit features Splash Wall as the sub weapon and Ink Storm as the special weapon.",

    "The Snipewriter 5B is a great illustration of how versatile the Snipewriter system is! The 5B is made from softer material than the 5H, making it even easier to learn. Throw out a Splash Wall for cover while you're charging up or unloading a full charge — or use it to distract from your Ink Storm special. With the capacity for five shots on a full charge, the Snipewriter 5B makes a great first charger, because there's not so much pressure on aiming one powerful shot perfectly. Of course, with the luxury of hiding out behind that Splash Wall, maybe you CAN aim perfectly! Why not give this set a try and find out?",
    "Similar to the Snipewriter 5H, the 5B in the name of the Snipewriter 5B is based on the pencil grading of the same name. A 5B-graded pencil is made of extremely soft graphite and marks in black. It is also likely short for \"5 bullets\" in a similar vein to the Snipewriter 5H's \"5 hits\" referencing the number of shots on one full charge.",
