    "The Kelp Splat Charger is a main weapon in Splatoon. It is a Splat Charger with a different loadout, and some kelp attached to the rear. In Splatoon 2, it was converted into the Firefin Splat Charger.",
    "The Kelp Splat Charger is nearly identical in appearance to the Splat Charger. However, the Kelp Splat Charger has a piece of kelp nailed to the right side of the ink tank.",
    "The Kelp Splat Charger is in a set with Sprinklers and the Killer Wail.",
    "[1]",
    "I created the Kelp Splat Charger based on my grandpappy's blueprints. Cool seaweed design, right? Though, if I'm honest, it's exactly the same as the Splat Charger in stats. But this set comes with the Sprinkler to ink hard-to-reach locations while you hold a strategic position! And the Killer Wail will blow all of your opponents away! Use it well to turn the tide of battle!",
