    "The Z+F Splatterscope is a main weapon in Splatoon 3, introduced in Fresh Season 2023. It is a Z+F-branded variant of the Splatterscope, and a scoped variant of the Z+F Splat Charger. It was teased in the Fresh Season 2023 poster on 16 February 2023 and was officially revealed on Splatoon's Twitter accounts on 20 February 2023. It was released on 1 March 2023.",
    "It is a rebranded successor of Firefin Splatterscope from Splatoon 2 following the merger between Firefin and Zekko to form Z+F.",

    "If you've ever wished that your Z+F Splat Charger had a way to see just... a bit... farther... now it kinda does! They call it the Z+F Splatterscope, and it's got a scope! Keep in mind that using the scope limits your field of view - and with this weapon specifically, keeps you from storing a charge. But with the Splash Wall and Triple Inkstrike in your back pocket, I think the benefits of this loadout are clear as day!",
