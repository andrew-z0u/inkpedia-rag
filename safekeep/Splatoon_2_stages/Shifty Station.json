    "Shifty Station is the title given to a series of multiplayer stages in Splatoon 2. The stages were originally only available during Splatfests, but were made available in Private Battles starting with version 5.0.0. Only one Shifty Station appeared per Splatfest, except for Chaos vs. Order and Super Mushroom vs. Super Star, which had multiple, and the Splatoon 2 Splatfest World Premiere, which had none.",
    "Shifty Stations typically either have parts of the stage moving around and/or Octo Canyon stage gimmicks, such as Ink Cannons and Grapplinks. The only stages that are exceptions to this rule are Sweet Valley Tentacles, The Splat in our Zones, and MC.Princess Diaries. Sweet Valley Tentacles uses a unique gimmick, The Splat in our Zones uses free Splat Zones, and MC.Princess Diaries uses hyperbombs from the Octo Expansion as well as Pearl's Princess Cannon.",

    "- Marina claims to have helped make the stage herself, which is shown by her symbol appearing on the stage image.\nAs Marina mentions often in the news segments, she was raised around Octarian machinery, which would explain why many of the Shifty Station variants contain at least one of the Octo Valley and Octo Canyon mechanics.\nThis is elaborated on further in the Octo Expansion.
