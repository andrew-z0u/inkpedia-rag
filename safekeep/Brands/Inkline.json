    "Inkline is a brand producing outdoor wear and tools.[1]",
    "In all of the games it appears in, the Inkline logo depicts a simplified mountain range, reflecting the outdoor wear focus and rugged aesthetic of the brand's gear. Additionally, the logo features Inkling text of some form that is consistent across games.",
    "In Splatoon, the logo has a sky/ocean blue look. It has the aforementioned mountain range on the top, with each 'mountain' being represented by a triangle split into two sides - one side transparent, the other blue, and each one has a turquoise outline. The bottom part of the logo is blue rectangle with a convex bottom, and has the aforementioned text in white inside, warped to fit the shape it is in.",
    "In Splatoon 2, the logo changed to a more faded/tan look, and changed significantly, with a dark brown rectangle as the background for the whole logo. The mountain range has the background mountains removed, having only one large mountain and two in front of it, and the color of the mountain and outline is changed to a brown-cream color. Above the mountain is the logo text, warped to fit the shape of the mountain range, reaching down to the bottom corners of the rectangle on either side, colored in three horizontal stripes that are, from top to bottom: dark magenta, bright yellow, and soft blue. This design is retained in Splatoon 3.",

    "Reaching a cumulative amount of stars on Inkline gear will reward the player with badges.",
    "Inkline's name is a multi-faceted pun. \"Ink\" is a reference to squids, \"Line\" refers to climbing rope and is also a term for a series of fashion items, while \"Inkline\" itself sounds like \"Incline\", again hinting towards the brand's propensity towards climbing gear.",
    "Inkline's Japanese name, シグレニ Shigureni, is a dish with tsukudani clams.",
