    "Tentatek is a gear brand in the Splatoon series. Tentatek makes a variety of gear and has designed three weapons: the Tentatek Splattershot (in collaboration with Splat), Dark Tetra Dualies, and Light Tetra Dualies. Their gear has a 5× chance of rolling Ink Recovery Up as a sub ability and a 0.5× chance of rolling Quick Super Jump.",
    "According to SplatoonJP, Tentatek produces sportswear and athletic shoes,[1] with their brightly colored, high-tech trainers and Sea Slugs popular among young Inklings.[2]",
    "In Splatoon, the Tentatek logo consists of a hot pink (deep cerise) oval with a white horizontal figure 8 shape (resembling the \"eye mask\" Inklings have on their face) inside it and the Inkling wordmark below it in the same hot pink color. The wordmark seems to be a very stylized round script, mimicking the letters \"AROME\" (the brand's Japanese name), and ends with an Inkling rendition of the trademark symbol.",
    "In Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3, Tentatek's logo is slightly simplified, having only the figure 8 shape in the same previous hot pink color and the trademark symbol in the bottom-right corner of the icon. However, returning gear from the original Splatoon retains the old logo and the wordmark are used in some in-universe Tentatek promotions.",
    "For the category page, see Category:Tentatek.",
    "Tentatek has gear with the labels 'Iromaki 750', 'Norimaki 750' and 'Sea Slug'.",
    "Reaching a cumulative amount of stars on Tentatek gear will reward the player with badges.",
