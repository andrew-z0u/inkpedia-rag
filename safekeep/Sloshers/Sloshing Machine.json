    "The Sloshing Machine is a main weapon in the Splatoon series.",
    "The Sloshing Machine launches a small mortar-like glob that is trailed by a vortex of ink. The glob leaves a path of ink while it travels, and bursts on contact with a surface or an enemy. Most notably, the vortex of ink allows the Sloshing Machine to do splash damage to enemies alongside the glob of ink if a direct hit is not landed. Notably, the vortex throws out small, non-damaging ink droplets that ink small portions of turf around where the projectile lands.",
    "The Sloshing Machine's splash damage allows it to fulfill roles similar to that of a blaster. More specifically, it is very similar to the Rapid Blaster concerning splash damage, direct damage, range, and speed. However, unlike blaster weapons which have a large exploding splash radius at their maximum reach, the Sloshing Machine will deal splash damage to anything alongside the glob as it travels. Additionally, the heavy arc of the projectile makes the weapon ideal for dealing with enemies behind cover, or enemies atop a platform, like the tower in Tower Control. These capabilities, however, come at the cost of lower attack-speed and turf coverage when compared to more traditional sloshers.",
    "The Sloshing Machine is a small, cream-colored washing machine. It has two handles, one on the bottom and one on the top, both of which change color to match the user's ink, along with the bottom section.",
    "In Splatoon 3, the upper section of the Sloshing Machine now entirely changes ink color while the bottom section, including the handle, are now cream-colored. The rim at the top is thicker, and the inside of the weapon has been slightly changed. On the side, four small suction cups have been added to each corner of the weapon.",
    "The Sloshing Machine was released on 28 November 2015 at 02:00 UTC.[1][2][3] It comes in a set with Splat Bombs and the Bomb Rush.",
    "[4]",
    "An innovative new weapon that puts a \"spin\" on the classic Slosher model. The Sloshing Machine is sure to make your whites whiter than white and your turf inkier than inked! This weapon's attractions are the power of the main shot and the bonus ink flung out by the vortex. The Splat Bombs and Bomb Rush combine to send the battlefield into a whirlpool of confusion!(NA/EU/OC)",
    "The Sloshing Machine returns in Splatoon 2, looking identical to how it did in the first game. It comes with Autobombs and Sting Ray. It was released on 26 August 2017 at 02:00 UTC.[5]",
    "It appears in three Octo Expansion stations:",
    "[6]",
    "The Sloshing Machine is basically your normal everyday washing machine...except it fires twisting volleys of beautiful, messy ink! The spiraling ink volleys provide solid attack power and leave a trail of ink in their wake. Smoke out dirty campers with the Autobombs, and splat them off the map! If they survive that, you can hunt them down with the Sting Ray! This set is perfect for splatting like a wild child and drowning the battlefield in a whirlwind of ink!",
    "The Sloshing Machine returns in Splatoon 3 with a new design. The color scheme has been swapped, and it has a new metal rim at the front. Its special is the Booyah Bomb, but in prerelease material and on a Tableturf Battle card it was seen with the Killer Wail 5.1. Its sub is the Fizzy Bomb.",
    "It appears in three missions in Return of the Mammalians:",
    "[7]",
    "The Sloshing Machine is like a washing machine... but for getting everything filthy with ink! Each volley of beautiful, twisting ink hits its target with plenty of power and leaves a sloppy mess everywhere. It's great for covering plenty of turf. Try using Fizzy Bombs to contain the other team's movement while you dial the Sloshing Machine up to the max. The other team will be in a spin cycle before you know it! And don't forget about your Booyah Bombs - another tool in your quest to make a mess-terpiece of the field. By now it should be clear... this set is NOT for neat freaks.",
