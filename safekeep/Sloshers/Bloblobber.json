    "The Bloblobber is a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3.",
    "It is a slosher-type weapon that shoots a row of four small bubbles which are able to bounce along the ground and off walls. The weapon boasts fairly long range and is able to splat opponents in a single shot if all four bubbles connect. The bubbles do not suffer from any type of damage decay, doing a consistent 30 damage regardless of range. The distance the bubbles are able to travel varies greatly depending on the amount of obstructions in their way, the bubbles will gradually shrink as they travel before vanishing. Colliding with walls or inclining surfaces will reduce the travel range of the bubble, as well as cause them to shrink faster.",
    "The Bloblobber is a small black bathtub with a white inside. Unlike a traditional bathtub, the Bloblobber has no legs and has extra supports and a handle. It is also small enough to hold.",
    "The Bloblobber was released on 1 August 2018 at 00:00 UTC.[1] It comes with Splash Wall and Ink Storm.",
    "[2]",
    "After the blob law was passed, I created the Bloblobber to lob lawful blob bombs. Read the whole story on my Bloblobber blob law blog! Ahem... The design was inspired by a bathtub, and each fling of it unleashes four bouncing blobs! The Splash Wall sub provides cover from enemy attacks, and the Ink Storm special allows you to zone enemies and support your team! This set's a must for anyone looking to draw attention with bounding, lawful blobs, while also reminding your opponents to take a bath!",
    "The Bloblobber returns in Splatoon 3, retaining its design from Splatoon 2. Its kit is the Sprinkler and Ink Storm.",
    "It appears in two missions in Return of the Mammalians:",
    "[4]",
    "Even if you've never lobbed a blob, it's not against blob law to use the Bloblobber! What's more, each lob fires four blobs - that's an awful lot of lawful blobs! Once your tongue is untied, you can use the Bloblobber to target a single enemy - perhaps your friend Rob - or an entire mob. Truly, it's a versatile weapon for every job. And although they sound out of place here, the Sprinkler sub weapon and Ink Storm special actually complement this set quite nicely. Like butter melting over corn on the cob!",
    "For competitive tips about the Bloblobber",
    "The Bloblobber is a combination of Blob and Lobber, coming together to mean \"One that lobs blobs\", referring to what the weapon does, as well as rhyming. The \"verb\" Bloblob can be separated into two blobs as well.",
