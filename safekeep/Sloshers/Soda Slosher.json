    "The Soda Slosher is a main weapon in Splatoon and Splatoon 2. It is a Slosher with a different kit and color scheme.",
    "It is a bucket of ink that can be swung to throw out globs of ink that leave trails behind them. The trajectory of the ink can be adjusted by aiming higher or lower than horizontally. Its globs do enough damage to splat opponents in two shots.",
    "The Soda Slosher deals constant damage no matter how far away the ink travels, as opposed to most other classes dealing less damage as ink travels farther due to fall-off damage. However, there is still fall-off damage when targeting opponents below the player, dealing less than maximum damage.",
    "The Soda Slosher shares its overall design with the Slosher. However, the Soda Slosher has a yellow bucket, supports colored in various shades of blue, and purple springs. Unlike the Slosher, the design of the Soda Slosher does not vary between games.",
    "The Soda Slosher is one of eight weapons included in Sheldon's Picks Vol. 1 and was released at  02:00 UTC on 13 April 2016.[1][2] It comes with Splat Bombs and the Inkzooka.",
    "[3]",
    "The Soda Slosher is based on a regular Slosher, but with some adjustments to the setup. The main weapon and Splat Bombs spread ink far and wide, charging up the powerful Inkzooka. This set is bubbling with offensive and defensive power. Give it a go - you'll really taste the difference.",
    "The Soda Slosher was released on 3 April 2019 at 01:00 UTC as part of version 4.6.0.[5] It comes with Splat Bombs and the Burst-Bomb Launcher.",
    "[6]",
    "The Soda Slosher is functionally equivalent to the Slosher itself, but comes with a new loadout and look! Use the Splat Bomb sub and Burst-Bomb Launcher special in coordination with your main to tear down all who stand before you! With two type of bombs and a powerful main weapon at your disposal, this set will get you into the mix on defense OR offense!",
    "For competitive tips about the Soda Slosher",
    "Soda Slosher is derived from soda and the verb to slosh. Soda likely refers to its bright color scheme, a common design feature on soda cans and soft drinks in general. Soda is also used to separate it from the Slosher and the Slosher Deco.",
    "バケットスロッシャーソーダ Baketto Surosshā Sōda is derived from bucket, the verb to slosh and soda. Bucket Slosher Soda most likely contains the word soda for the same reasons as the English name.",
