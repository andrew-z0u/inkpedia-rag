    "The Tri-Slosher ASH-N is a main weapon in the Splatoon series. It is a Barazushi-branded variant of the the Tri-Slosher from the Splatlands Collection and features a different sub and special weapon.",
    "The Tri-Slosher ASH-N is similar to the Tri-Slosher with the main difference being the bucket is now a dark gray instead of blue. The handle is now a dark brown and a packet resembling a field ration packet stamped with Barazushi's logo is attached to the right side.",
    "The Tri-Slosher ASH-N makes its first appearance in Splatoon 3 with identical stats to the Tri-Slosher. It comes with Splat Bomb and Splattercolor Screen.",
    "[1]",
    "If the Tri-Slosher is too crude for you, perhaps the Tri-Slosher ASH-N is more your speed. Designed by Barazushi using an ultra-light alloy, it oozes class like only a bucket can. Plus, if you use your Splat Bombs and the Splattercolor Screen well, you'll be able to distract opponents and create opportunities to dump that triple bucket of ink on 'em. I recommend this set to anyone who likes to burn the candle at both ends on the battlefield and leave only a blanket of ash behind.",
    "The brand stylization \"ASH-N\" could be interpreted as ashen, regarding the weapon's coloration, or ashing.",

    "- The matchmaking range is 11. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.",
    "- The ink consumption of 6% per shot allows the user to fire 16 times on a full ink tank.",
    "- After firing, there is a 35 frame cooldown before ink starts refilling.",

    "- The time between consecutive swings is 23 frames.",
    "- The interval between firing and being able to enter swim form or use a sub weapon is 20 frames.",
    "- The effective range is about 11.04 units while grounded and 10.45 while airborne.\nThis is the distance in which the crosshair will change shape when looking at an opponent and is otherwise arbitrary since sloshers do not use traditional falloff mechanics.",

Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed more and fall faster.\nEach subsequent projectile spawns with an initial speed that is 0.16 units per frame slower than the last.",
    "- The projectiles deal 62 damage.\nDamage falloff starts when a projectile falls 1.5 units below its initial spawning point. It will lose damage the further it falls until it has fallen to 8.0 units below its spawning point, at which point it will deal 35 damage.",
