    "The Tri-Slosher Nouveau is a main weapon in the Splatoon series. It is the Nouveau-branded version of the Tri-Slosher with a different loadout.",
    "The Tri-Slosher Nouveau is nearly identical in appearance to the Tri-Slosher. The only difference between the two is that the Tri-Slosher Nouveau has a sticker bearing the Nouveau logo on the side of the bucket.",
    "In Splatoon 3, the bucket itself is based on its base variant's redesign, and the handle is light blue.",
    "The Tri-Slosher Nouveau was released on 19 December 2015 at  02:00 UTC.[1] It comes with Seekers and the Echolocator.",

    "The Tri-Slosher Nouveau features snazzy decorations selected by the manufacturers themselves. Combined with the Seeker sub weapon, this set's ability to apply pressure is its strongest selling point! Activate the Echolocator to support your team, and push the enemy back into their base!(NA)",

Gather your allies around, activate the Echolocator, and push the enemy back in one fell swoop!(EU/OC)",
    "The Tri-Slosher Nouveau was released on 14 April 2018 at  02:00 UTC.[3] It comes with Splat Bombs and the Ink Storm.",

    "The Tri-Slosher Nouveau is a special version of the Tri-Slosher adorned with an exclusive sticker!\nCombined with the main weapon, the time-delayed explosions of the Splat Bombs allow for maximum ink coverage!\nYou can use the Ink Storm special to make opponents scatter or stop in their tracks. The perfect set for the real team players out there!",
    "The Tri-Slosher Nouveau returns in Splatoon 3. It functions the same as the normal Tri-Slosher, but has a different kit and appearance. It has a Nouveau sticker on the side and a light blue handle rather than the traditional yellow one. The kit is Fizzy Bomb and Tacticooler. The weapon was teased in the Fresh Season 2023 poster shown on 16 February 2023 and was officially revealed on 23 February 2023. It released on 28 February 2023.",
    "[5]",
    "The Tri-Slosher Nouveau is a special version of the Tri-Slosher that includes an exclusive sticker! And if the sticker isn't selling it, let me tell you about the loadout... First up, you get Fizzy Bombs, enabling you to close the distance between you and your opponents quickly. If you've used sloshers before, you already know that close equals splat! And you can amp up the mobility even more with the Tacticooler! Now you're gliding around the map like a manta ray with rocket boosters, and your teammates are getting a boost too. Don't even get me started on the ink coverage. It's also great! So I hope you give this set a try. It can really turn the tide in battle!",
    "For competitive tips about the Tri-Slosher Nouveau",
    "Tri-Slosher Nouveau is derived from the verb to slosh, Tri, a shortening meaning Three, and Nouveau, french for New. Nouveau may also refer to Art Nouveau. The suffix Nouveau is also used to differentiate it from the Tri-Slosher. This trait is shared among the other alternate sets of the Nouveau brand.",
    "ヒッセン・ヒュー Hissen Hyū means Brush Washer Hue. 筆洗 Hissen are segmented buckets that are used for cleaning paintbrushes. ヒュー Hyū refers to hue. Like Nouveau in the English name, Hue is used to differentiate it from the Tri-Slosher.",
