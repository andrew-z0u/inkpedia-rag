    "The Sloshing Machine Neo is a main weapon in the Splatoon series. It is a Neo-branded variant of the Sloshing Machine.",
    "The Sloshing Machine Neo is nearly identical in appearance to the Sloshing Machine. The only difference between the two is that the Sloshing Machine Neo has a sticker bearing the Neo logo on its side. In Splatoon 3 the place of the logo is changed to be on top of the weapon, and the bottom part of it is now black.",
    "The Sloshing Machine Neo was released on 9 January 2016 at 02:00 UTC.[1] It comes in a set with Point Sensors and the Inkzooka.",
    "[2]",
    "The Sloshing Machine Neo features a special sticker from the manufacturer. The Point Sensor sub weapon leads you straight to the enemy, letting you unleash twisty destruction! And if you feel the need for more range than the main shot can offer, that's where the Inkzooka comes in!\n(NA/EU/OC)",
    "The Sloshing Machine Neo was released on 17 February 2018 at 02:00 UTC.[3] It comes with Point Sensors and the Splat-Bomb Launcher.",
    "[4]",
    "The Sloshing Machine Neo features a special sticker from the manufacturer. Its stats are the same, but you can use the Point Sensor to reveal the location of opponents to your entire team! And for any opponents that manage to evade you, use the Splat-Bomb Launcher to send 'em back to their spawn point! Recommended to tactical players who want to support their team and splat their enemies!",
    "As with the regular version, the main weapon is a great tool for striking foes who are cowering behind cover, and the addition of a Point Sensor means that nobody can hide from you for long.",
    "On top of that, the Splat Bomb Launcher(sic) special helps you rapidly secure turf for your team.",
    "The Sloshing Machine Neo returns in Splatoon 3 as part of the Drizzle Season 2023. Its design is slightly updated, with its bottom part now being black. Its kit consists of Point Sensor and Trizooka, which is based on its Splatoon kit.",
    "[5]",
    "The Sloshing Machine Neo isn't so much an upgrade from the basic Sloshing Machine as a...side-grade. It has the same basic ability to slosh ink all over the place. But it has a new look and a new loadout to play with—including the Point Sensor sub! Throw one down to mark enemy positions, then put 'em in the splat cycle with your main. If you've got stubborn enemy ink stains that just won't come out, that's when it's time to fire up the Trizooka special. I'll put it this way... it's not for delicates! This set is great for players who want to put the other team in a permanent press and see a sparkling clean sweep at the end.",
    "Sloshing Machine Neo is a pun derived from the verb to slosh and Washing Machine, plus the suffix Neo, Ancient Greek for new. The suffix Neo is also used to differentiate it from the Sloshing Machine. This trait is shared among the other alternate sets of the Neo brand.",
    "スクリュースロッシャーネオ Sukuryū Surosshā Neo is derived from Screw and the verb to slosh, plus the suffix Neo. Screw likely refers to spinning motion of this weapon's projectile. Like the English name, Neo is also used to differentiate it from Screw Slosher.",
