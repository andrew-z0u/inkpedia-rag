    "The Dread Wringer D is a main weapon in Splatoon 3. It is the \"D\" brand version of the Dread Wringer.",
    "The Dread Wringer D appears broadly similar to the base Dread Wringer, but its lower bucket is black instead of light gray, its metal frame is a tarnished speckled brown, and it has a \"D\" brand sticker on each side.",
    "The Dread Wringer D was revealed in the Fresh Season 2024 trailer on 13 February 2024 and was released on 1 March 2024. Its kit consists of the Squid Beakon and Wave Breaker.",
    "[1][2]",
    "The Dread Wringer D is a limited-edition model of the Dread Wringer from the manufacturer. Trust me—you're not just paying for a fancy logo! What you get for your money is a weapon with all the same stats as the Dread Wringer but a little bit better at supporting your squad. The Wave Breaker special paints a target on enemies' backs. That's when you call in your allies with the Squid Beakon sub to go after them team-handed! If your thing is seeing the big picture and assisting allies as needed, this model plays right into your hands. Give yourself a promotion from grunt to general!",
    "\"D\" is from the manufacturer of this weapon, the \"Dolphin\" brand.",
