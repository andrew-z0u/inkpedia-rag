    "The Tri-Slosher is a main weapon in the Splatoon series.",
    "It is a slosher-type weapon that is separated into three sections and is similar in appearance as a Japanese brush washer bucket. As its appearance implies, it can throw in three different directions. It covers a straight line forward and two splotches to the side, though the damage dealt by connecting multiple of the splotches is the same as that dealt by connecting one. The range is short compared to other sloshers.",
    "The Tri-Slosher is a plastic bucket that is divided into multiple sections with the user's ink in them.",
    "In Splatoon and Splatoon 2, the bucket is green, its shape is circular with three triangular sections and a circular section in the middle, the handle is lime green, and there is a black attachment at the back of the bucket that serves as a handhold. In Splatoon 2, the bucket is a lighter green than in Splatoon. Like the Slosher, there is a reservoir of ink inside the bucket which changes color to match that of the user's.",
    "In Splatoon 3, the Tri-Slosher has a new design. The bucket is now blue, square-shaped, divided into three rectangular sections by two vertical lines, and the handle is yellow.",
    "The Tri-Slosher was released on 26 September 2015 at  02:00 UTC.[1][2] It comes with Disruptors and the Bubbler.",
    "[3]",
    "The Tri-Slosher is Slosher-type weapon with three angles of attack! The individual splashes lose a little bit of power, but the wide spread makes it very handy in a tight spot! The Disruptor and Bubbler special make this set perfect for in-your-face splatting.(NA)",
    "The Tri-Slosher is a Slosher-type weapon able to attack from three different angles at once! The individual splashes lose a little bit of power, but the wide spread makes it very handy in a tight spot! The Disruptor and Bubbler make this setup suited to a relentless battlefield hunter.(EU/OC)",
    "The Tri-Slosher returns in Splatoon 2, looking identical to how it did in the first game. It comes with Burst Bombs and Ink Armor.",
    "It appears in one Octo Expansion station:",
    "[4]",
    "The Tri-Slosher is a Slosher-type weapon that lobs ink in three directions in front of you at once! Since the ink is being split in three, it does reduce the attack power slightly, but if you follow up with a Burst Bomb, you're good to go! All that's left is to push forward with the Ink Armor! Recommended for those who really love to aggressively splat their opponents.",
    "The Tri-Slosher returns in Splatoon 3 with a new design. Its kit is Toxic Mist and Inkjet.",
    "It appears in one mission in Return of the Mammalians:",
    "[5]",
    "The Tri-Slosher answers a question that nobody asked, which is... \"Please let me fling three giant buckets of ink at the same time.\" Hey, come to think of it, that's not even a question! Anyway, since the Tri-Slosher offers a broader attack, the inkpower is a bit less than your basic Slosher. But when you've got Toxic Mist to slow enemies down, it's barely even a problem. Add in the Inkjet, and you're packing plenty of power. This is a set for sloshing away with impunity!",
    "For competitive tips about the Tri-Slosher",
    "Tri-Slosher is derived from the verb to slosh and tri, a prefix meaning 'three'.",
    "ヒッセン Hissen means \"Brush Washer\". 筆洗 Hissen are segmented buckets that are used for cleaning paintbrushes.",
