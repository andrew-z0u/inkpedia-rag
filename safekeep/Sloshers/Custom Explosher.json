    "The Custom Explosher is a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3. It is a Custom-branded variant of the Explosher.",
    "In Splatoon 2, the Custom Explosher is nearly identical in appearance to the Explosher. The only difference between the two is that the Custom Explosher has a sticker bearing the Custom logo on its side.",
    "In Splatoon 3, the Custom sticker is still present, but the color of the weapon is beige instead of olive green.",
    "The Custom Explosher was announced on 24 November 2018. It was added to the game on 5 December 2018 as part of the version 4.3.0 release.[1]",
    "[2]",
    "The Custom Explosher is built with custom-tooled parts to create a cool new take on the original! It works like the standard model but comes with a Point Sensor for tracking down foes. And if your opponents are closing in, pop your Baller special and roll out the welcome mat! Are you the type who's eager to greet opponents near or far with inky hospitality? Then give this set a try!",
    "The Custom Explosher returns in Splatoon 3 with a new design and beige color. The weapon was added in the Fresh Season 2024 update. Its kit comes with Splash Walls and the Triple Splashdown.",
    "[3]",
    "The Custom Explosher is built with custom-tooled parts to create a new take on the original! It's basically the same Explosher you know and love, but this one comes with the Splash Wall sub to keep enemies at bay in close combat. And if your opponents push the issue, simply retort in the form of a devastating Triple Splashdown! I recommend this set to anyone with a customer-first approach. Go to your \"clients\" where they live, and deliver the hard sell!",
