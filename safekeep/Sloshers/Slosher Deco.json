    "The Slosher Deco is a main weapon in the Splatoon series. It is the Deco-branded version of the Slosher.",
    "The Slosher Deco is a bucket full of ink that can be swung to splatter turf and enemies in a thick, straight line. The trajectory of the ink can be adjusted to strike enemies behind walls or on above high surfaces. It is strong enough to splat opponents in only two shots.",
    "The Slosher Deco deals constant damage no matter how far away the ink travels, as opposed to rollers and shooters dealing less damage as ink travel farther due to fall-off damage. However, there is still fall-off damage when targeting opponents below the player, dealing less than maximum damage.",
    "The Slosher Deco is nearly identical in appearance to the Slosher. The only difference between the two is that the Slosher Deco has some stickers bearing the Deco logo on the supports. In Splatoon 3, the supports are recolored, fading from black-to-blue, then to the user's ink color.",
    "The Slosher Deco was released on 25 November 2015 at 02:00 UTC.[1][2][3] The Slosher Deco comes with Splash Walls and the Kraken. The Slosher Deco deals constant 70 damage no matter how far away the ink travels, or what part the opponent is hit by.",
    "[4]",
    "The Slosher Deco is a Slosher decorated with a special sticker designed by the manufacturer! Throw up the Splash Wall to buy time while you ink your way to unleashing the almighty Kraken. This set is great for those who aren't afraid to try something a little different!(NA)",
    "The Slosher Deco is a Slosher emblazoned with a special sticker designed by the manufacturer! Throw up the Splash Wall to buy time while you ink your way to unleashing the almighty Kraken. A strong setup in the right hands, this would suit a battler dedicated to trying something a little different!(EU/OC)",
    "In Splatoon 2, the Slosher returns with a new design that is primarily orange instead of pink. It was released on 15 December 2017 at 02:00 UTC.[5] It comes in a set with Sprinklers and the Baller. As of Version 4.0.0, the weapon no longer does a consistent 70 damage but deals a maximum of 50 damage if opponents are hit from above by the trail of ink between the primary glob and the player.",
    "[6]",
    "The main Slosher Deco is a Slosher decorated with an exclusive sticker! The Sprinkler sub paired with the main weapon's large ink volume allows you to ink a large area at once! Use the Baller to charge into your opponents' turf and cause a scene! This is a great set for players who just want to ink everything!",
    "The Slosher Deco returns to Splatoon 3 with a new black and blue color scheme, and the Deco arrow stickers also return. Its kit consists of Angle Shooters and the Zipcaster. It debuted in Chill Season 2022.",
    "[7]",
    "Slosher users - ever feel like your slosher just isn't as fancy as some of the other weapon types? Well, check out the Slosher Deco! It has cool stickers on it! I joke, but no one will be laughing when you master the Angle Shooter sub and tag all your enemies for easy splatting by your teammates. And if you use the Zipcaster to reach high ground, you can rain down ink all day long like only a slosher main can. Your bucket will runneth over with this set, so be sure to give it a try if you like sloshing!",
    "For competitive tips about the Slosher Deco",
    "Slosher Deco is derived from the verb to slosh and Deco, short for either Decorated or Decoration. Deco may also refer to Art Deco. The suffix Deco is also used to differentiate it from the Slosher. This trait is shared among the other alternate sets of the Deco brand.",
    "バケットスロッシャーデコ Baketto Surosshā Deko is derived from Bucket and the verb to slosh, as well as Deco.",
