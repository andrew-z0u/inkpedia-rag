However, the strip across the ink tank is white, the metal handle is dark blue with black grips, and there is an extra silver-gray attachment on the right side of the roller. The CoroCoro logo is also debossed into the actual roller, alongside a CoroCoro decal on the weapon's ink tank and a decal of its dragon mascot on the side of the roller part.",
    "The CoroCoro Splat Roller was first announced in CoroCoro Comic,[1] which also revealed the CoroCoro Cap and the CoroCoro Hoodie. It was one of eight weapons included in Sheldon's Picks Vol. 2 and was released on 8 June 2016 at 02:00 UTC.[2]",

    "The CoroCoro Splat Roller is decorated with a cool logo I found inscribed on some ancient writings. It has a new hollow titanium frame, ball-bearing joints, steering dampers, super-stabilizers... So many new parts, in fact, that it kind of... came full circle. The specs ended up identical to the Splat Roller. But this is the first roller set with a Splash Wall! And I also threw in an Inkzooka because why not?!(NA)",
