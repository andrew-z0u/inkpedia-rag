    "The Order Roller is a roller in Splatoon 3 that is exclusively used in Side Order.",
    "The Order Roller has a minimalist appearance, with a white molded support and ink tank for the body of the weapon, as well as a metallic silver roller and handle. Its appearance is similar to that of a Splat Roller. When used, ring-shaped holograms manifest around the ends of the rolling part of the Roller.",
    "The Order Roller is a weapon unlocked in Side Order, and is part of Callie's Palette. Its base set consists of Burst Bombs and Kraken Royale. However, this can be changed in the Spire of Order by using a vending machine.",
    "It has lower stats in comparison to the Splat Roller, with a slower swing time, damage, strafe speed, rolling speed, ink efficiency, ink coverage, and range. However, this can be upgraded through color chips in the Spire of Order.",
