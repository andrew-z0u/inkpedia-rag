    "Carbon refers to carbon fiber, a very light material from which the Carbon Roller Deco is made. Many bicycle frames are made of carbon fiber, which alludes to the possibility that the Carbon Roller Deco was made from salvaged bicycle parts. Deco is short for either decorated or decoration, or may also refer to Art Deco, and is used to differentiate it from the Carbon Roller. This trait is shared among the other alternate sets of the Deco brand.",
