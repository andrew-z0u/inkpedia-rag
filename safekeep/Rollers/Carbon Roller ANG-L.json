    "The Carbon Roller ANG-L is a main weapon in the Splatoon series. It is a Barazushi-branded variant of the the Carbon Roller from the Splatlands Collection and features a different sub and special weapon.",
    "The Carbon Roller ANG-L makes its first appearance in Splatoon 3 with identical stats to the Carbon Roller.",
    "[1][2]",
    "Inspired by the deep-sea anglerfish, the Carbon Roller ANG-L was developed by Barazushi for use in all environments—perhaps even the bottom of the ocean! Throw in a Fizzy Bomb sub for extra mobility—which was not lacking, by the way–and this set can help you pounce on an opening as soon as it appears. That means when you catch opponents with the Super Chump special, they'll be sitting ducks. I hope you'll snap this set up and give it a try!",
    "The brand stylization suffix \"ANG-L\" is derived from anglerfish.",
