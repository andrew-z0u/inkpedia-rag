    "The Herobrush is a brush in Splatoon 2 that is exclusively used in Octo Canyon.",
    "The Herobrush has a very visually similar design to the Octobrush but wears the usual black and lime-green color scheme of the Hero Weapons. The handle and ink tank are black, and the ink tank has lime-green highlights and dots that change color depending on the upgrades.",
    "The Herobrush is usable in Octo Canyon and can be upgraded one level. Like all hero weapons in Splatoon 2, they come with switchable sub weapons of Splat Bombs, Curling Bombs and Autobombs. It is loaned to Agent 4 by Sheldon during the level Underground Expressway, and can be used in other missions after beating the level. Beating all missions in Octo Canyon with it unlocks the Herobrush Replica for purchase at Ammo Knights.",
    "The Herobrush Replica is a reward in Splatoon 2 unlocked for purchase at Ammo Knights by beating all missions with the Herobrush. It is a brush-type main weapon and is visually identical to the Herobrush. Despite its unique appearance, it is simply a reskin of the Octobrush; sharing the same stats and loadout (Autobombs and the Inkjet).",
