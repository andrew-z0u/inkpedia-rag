    "The Kensa Splat Roller is a limited edition, custom Splat Roller created in collaboration with Toni Kensa! It shares specs with the standard Splat Roller, but comes with Splat Bombs to halt foes in their tracks before you roll right over them! And what's more, with the Bubble Blower special, you'll have a means of putting the entire opposing team on notice at once! This might just be the set for you Roller fans out there who've felt a certain something's been missing from your game!",
