    "The Sorella Brella is a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3. It is a Sorella-branded version of the Splat Brella and comes with a different sub weapon and special weapon.",
    "The Sorella Brella is similar in appearance to the Splat Brella. However, the Sorella Brella has white highlights on the handle, and most of the canopy changes color to match the user's ink, but in differing shades. The canopy itself has polka dots and fish designs on it instead of the Splat Brella's checkers and seahorse designs.",
    "In Splatoon 3, the canopy received an updated design featuring a large black graphic in the middle of it, with borders in the same color as the user's ink. The fish on each side have been replaced with stylized designs of a pufferfish seen from the front, and the top and bottom of the canopy use Sorella branding. The muzzle, some parts of the handle and the tips of the canopy are also bright yellow.",
    "The Sorella Brella was released on 31 March 2018 at 02:00 UTC.[1] It comes with Autobombs and the Splat-Bomb Launcher.",
    "[2]",
    "The Sorella Brella main weapon has the same stats as the Splat Brella but with a different umbrella design and composition! Stay safe when pushing forward with your umbrella by tossing your Autobomb sub in areas where opponents may be hiding! Use the Splat-Bomb Launcher special to help out teammates in need, or to push the front lines forward! Recommended for aggressive players who want to support their team!",
    "The Sorella Brella returns in Splatoon 3 as part of the Drizzle Season 2023, with an updated design. Its kit consists of Autobomb and Inkjet.",
    "[3]",
    "The Sorella Brella is the fraternal twin of the Splat Brella—that is, same stats, same basic DNA, but different design and brella composition. And the loadout's different too! Now you can fend off foes with the Autobomb sub before pushing forward with the brella. Here's a pro move: deploy the brella shield, and then fire up your Inkjet special to rain down ink to support your allies making a forward push behind it. This set is carefully crafted for players who have the skill and experience to use each component in a coordinated attack. I hope you'll give it a try!",

    "Sorella Brella is derived from the words Sorella, which means \"sister\" in Italian, and brella.",
