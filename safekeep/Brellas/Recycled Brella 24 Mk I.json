    "The Recycled Brella 24 Mk I is a main weapon in Splatoon 3, made by Sorella. It is a brella that fires off and recovers its shield faster than the other weapons in the class.",
    "The Recycled Brella 24 Mk I resembles a traditional Japanese oil-paper umbrella, with the main shield being made of thin paper. The handle made from red bamboo and the circular turquoise cap are similar to the Bamboozler 14 weapons. The shield changes color to match the user's ink.",
    "This weapon's design could be a nod to members of the New Squidbeak Splatoon: it resembles the umbrella Marie uses in Octo Canyon and reuses parts of a Bamboozler 14, Cuttlefish's signature weapon. Its name formatting also matches that of the Bamboozler 14 Mk I in various languages.",
    "The Recycled Brella 24 Mk I was revealed in the Fresh Season 2024 trailer on 13 February 2024 and released on 1 March 2024. Its kit consists of Angle Shooter and Big Bubbler.",
    "Like all brellas, the Recycled Brella 24 Mk I fires several droplets of ink, but the dispersion of its shots is much less wide, offering exceptional accuracy and increased damage, at the cost of a flimsy shield. The shield itself deploys, launches, and regenerates faster than other brellas, compensating for its fragility.",

    "The Recycled Brella 24 Mk I is an interesting brella. It's made from paper stretched over a wood-and-bamboo framework. As you can imagine, that doesn't make for the sturdiest canopy, so it offers less protection than usual. But the brella is quick to launch and travels at a good clip when fired, making it better than usual as an offensive tool! Even better, direct hits from the main weapon really hurt! Distract your foes with a launched canopy and the Angle Shooter sub, then squeeze off a direct hit! Many brella users are uneasy about giving up their protection, but that's what the Big Bubbler special is for. When the ink starts to fly, it'll keep you safe! Probably! A brella centered around launching the canopy rather than hiding behind it takes some getting used to, but I highly recommend this to anyone who doesn't mind getting a bit wet!",
    "Its fast canopy release & cooldown is possible thanks to unique materials and crafting methods.\nThe canopy is primarily nori seaweed & is environmentally friendly, even when left scattered around the battlefield!",
    "For competitive tips about the Recycled Brella 24 Mk I",
    "\"Recycled\" refer to the weapon's appearance being similar to a Bamboozler 14. \"Recycled\" could also be in reference to the stated environmentally-friendly composition of the canopy, or its fast shield regeneration. \"24\" is a reference to the year in which the weapon was created: 2024. Finally, like the Bamboozler 14 Mk I, \"Mk I\" indicates that this is the first version of the weapon.",
