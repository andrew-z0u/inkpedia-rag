    "The Tenta Sorella Brella is a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3. It is a Sorella-branded version of the Tenta Brella and comes with a different sub weapon and special weapon.",
    "The Tenta Sorella Brella is nearly identical in appearance to the Tenta Brella. The only difference between the two is that the Tenta Sorella Brella has two white Inkline logos on the color-changing parts of the canopy facing the muzzle. In Splatoon 3, the rails supporting the canopy are also yellow instead of red.",
    "The Tenta Sorella Brella was released on 1 July 2018 at  00:00 UTC.[1] It comes with Splash Walls and the Curling-Bomb Launcher.",
    "[2]",
    "The Tenta Sorella Brella set is similar to the Tenta Brella set, but it has a modified design and a different sub and special. With the Splash Wall, you can double down on the defensive nature of the brella! And with your defenses in place, you can use the Curling-Bomb Launcher to shift to offense! Whether you're focused on attacking or defending, this setup should suit your style.",
    "The Tenta Sorella Brella was revealed on 16 May 2023 in the Sizzle Season 2023 trailer.[3] Its physical structure is the same as the original Tenta Brella, but its design has changed, with new neon yellow support beams on the shield's outside and Inkline logos on the weapon. Its kit consists of Ink Mines and Trizooka.",
    "[4]",
    "The Tenta Sorella Brella set is similar to the Tenta Brella set, but it has a modified design and a different sub and special. Now you'll be able to press forward with the brella and lay Ink Mines as you go. Spot an enemy? Flap that brella as hard as you can, and take 'em out! If a particularly slippery foe sneaks away, you've also got the Trizooka special in your arsenal. Near or far, it's got power and range aplenty. Clearly, this set has offensive oomph, but don't overlook the benefits of the brella's defense. If you can flip the switch from offense to defense on a whim, give it a try!",
