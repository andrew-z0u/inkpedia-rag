    "The Undercover Sorella Brella is a main weapon in Splatoon 2 & Splatoon 3. It is a Sorella-branded version of the Undercover Brella and comes with a different sub weapon and special weapon.",
    "The Undercover Sorella Brella is similar in appearance to the Undercover Brella. The handle is lighter in color and the shield has a black-and-gray checkered pattern instead of being pure black. In Splatoon 3, certain lines in the checkered pattern as well as the shaft between the handle and endpoint of the umbrella changes based on the user's ink color.",
    "The Undercover Sorella Brella was released on 1 June 2018 at  00:00 UTC.[1] It comes with Splat Bombs and the Baller.",
    "[2]",
    "The Undercover Sorella Brella brings all the specs of the original, but it now sports a snappy new design! Pin back the opposition with the Splat Bomb sub, and then close the distance and go toe to toe! You can also pop the Baller special and roll your way right into the heart of enemy turf! Looking for a set that'll let you live out your dreams of being an action-movie star? Look no further!",
    "The Undercover Sorella Brella returns in Splatoon 3 in Chill Season 2023. It features the Torpedo sub, and the Splattercolor Screen Special.",
    "[3]",
    "The Undercover Sorella Brella is so similar to the Undercover Brella that you could almost mistake the two for twin sisters! Not me though. I can easily tell them apart.  Anyway, this weapon offers the same sneaky play style, now paired with the Torpedo sub. Cover blown? Just toss one of these and disappear again. It's spycraft 101. And here's another top secret tip. If you set up a Splattercolor Screen on turf covered with enemy ink, it'll reveal the position of any enemy swimming in said ink. Neat, huh? I recommend this set for anyone who likes to pretend they're the hero in a spy movie from time to time. And that's everyone, not just me, right?",
