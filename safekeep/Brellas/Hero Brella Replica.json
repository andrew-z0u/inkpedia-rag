    "The Hero Brella Replica is a different design of the standard brella model with the same stats. This weapon came about after I made a breakthrough in my research and managed to create the ultimate weapon! Sadly, it never made it to mass production because the guys at the factory couldn't wrap their heads around my advanced schematics... So instead they just slapped some shiny bits on a standard brella and called it the Hero Brella Replica. Give it a swing!",
