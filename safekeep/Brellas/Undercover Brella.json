    "The Undercover Brella is a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3.",
    "The Undercover Brella is a brella that can be fired in rapid succession while its semi-transparent shield is open. The shield will open after the first shot fires if the user is holding down the trigger. The shield cannot be launched, and has the second lowest durability in its class.",
    "A minimum of three shots are needed to splat opponents with the Undercover Brella. Opponents who touch the shield will take 15 damage, which is half the damage taken from touching the shield of a Splat Brella or Tenta Brella, and 75% of the damage taken from touching the shield of a Recycled Brella. After splatting an opponent or assisting a teammate in splatting an opponent, the umbrella canopy instantly reappears if it had been destroyed, or is restored to maximum durability if it was still functional.",
    "The Undercover Brella looks like an ordinary black umbrella. The brown handle appears to be made of whangee, and the main shaft changes color to match the user's ink. The shield is black and semi-transparent with black beads at the end of the ribs and a brown-and-gold muzzle on top.",
    "The Undercover Brella was announced[1] on 21 November 2017 as a part of the 2.0.0 update. It was released on 30 December 2017 at  02:00 UTC.[2] It comes with Ink Mine and Splashdown.",
    "It appears in two Octo Expansion stations:",
    "[3]",
    "The Undercover Brella looks like a normal umbrella, but that's just to throw people off. It's actually made for clandestine face-splatting! The canopy-launching mechanism has been removed to allow for rapid fire. It can even be fired while the protective canopy is open! Use the Ink Mine to mark your foes, then swim in quickly and unleash a surprise attack! Come to the aid of cornered allies with the Splashdown special! Even spies have gotta go loud sometimes, right?",
    "Adding to this kit is the Ink Mine and the Splashdown special. The Splashdown isn't particularly spy-like, but it does pack a surprising punch for unsuspecting Inklings. You can try it yourself when it becomes available later this evening.",
    "The Undercover Brella returns in Splatoon 3 and has nearly identical stats to Splatoon 2, with the only difference being its special point requirement being raised from 150p to 180p. Its kit now has Ink Mines and the Reefslider.",
    "It appears in one mission in Return of the Mammalians:",
    "[5]",
    "Of all the brella-type weapons, the Undercover Brella looks the most like an ordinary umbrella. And that's no accident - the weapon was designed for stealth splatting! Getting into the technical aspects, the canopy-launching mechanism has been removed here to allow for rapid fire. The weapon can even be fired while the canopy is open! Back to stealth capabilities - you can use the Ink Mine sub weapon to help scope opponent positions before sneaking in for a splat they'll never see coming. And if you're spotted? Throw all subtlety out the window, fire up the Reefslider, and ride boldly to victory! I recommend this set to all aspiring spies, especially those who know how to walk softly and carry a big shark-based motorcycle.",
    "\"Undercover\" is a figurative term used in covert operations when a person or group is operating under a cover, obfuscating their true identities or allegiances; this befits the spy-based theming of the Undercover Brella often described by Sheldon and the Squid Research Lab. It can also be more literally interpreted as \"under cover\", in the sense of sheltering behind an object that protects from enemy fire (in this case, the brella's canopy).",
