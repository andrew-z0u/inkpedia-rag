    "Flounder Heights is a multiplayer stage in Splatoon and Splatoon 3. It is a map set on an apartment complex with many high vantage points and low, corner-based areas. It is a vertical stage with many inkable walls, allowing for several navigation options. It is one of the stages that can have Tricolor Turf Wars.",
    "The center of Flounder Heights contains two towers connected by a grated bridge. This is where most fighting occurs, as the only way to get to the other side of the map is by going over the towers or through the alley beneath the bridge. Two alleys separate each team's base from the central towers, which each consist of one tree for cover. The bases in Flounder Heights resemble the starting areas in Saltspray Rig; the other team cannot reach the higher part of the plaza, and there are four ways of exiting into the low alleys. On both sides of the stage is a map that shows the layout of ink on the stage from a top-down perspective. However, the  GamePad map renders these mostly redundant.",
    "Flounder Heights received significant changes in Splatoon 3. The spawn region was changed drastically, moved more to the left and having more flat ground that leads to the left or to slightly higher ground to the right. The tunnel to the right side of the stage has been removed. Between the spawn points and middle of the stage remains mostly the same, except that there is now a pit in the center of the low ground. The left wall up to the middle of the stage also has changed slightly, with the other side being uninkable. Parts of the wall on the right have been made uninkable and terrain on the right has been removed. The entire center of the stage has been made shorter in height. The general structure of the center of the stage is the same.",
    "In Ranked Battles, specifications for the terrain or placement of objects are different between the modes; these changes create new paths or new objects to take cover behind.",
    "The layout of Flounder Heights is unchanged, with the two Splat Zones located on the towers in the center of the map. Inkable walls can be used for direct access to either zone, in addition to the path on the left side. The grated bridge connecting the towers can be used to move directly between the zones.",
    "In Splatoon 3 the Splat Zones are in the same place. The small pit near the middle of the stage is filled to be on the same level as the main floor. An Inkrail is added on each team's snipe, giving another way to the towers.",
    "The Tower starts in the trench between the two towers in the center of the map, below the grate connecting them. It then moves directly out of the trench and over the small wall into the alley. The tower then turns right before heading to the ramp into the sandlot outside the opposing team's spawn point, where the goal is located.",
    "In Splatoon 3 the Tower route is significantly changed. The Tower starts on the grates instead of being below them. It goes right then forward to go down the main entrance to the towers. After reaching the bottom, it goes forward for a bit then left to the goal. It is also possible to Squid Surge to the Tower from the trench.",
    "The Rainmaker in Flounder Heights is located on top of the grated bridge in the center of the map. The goal is located outside of the opposing team's base in the sandlot below the spawn point. Three stacks of boxes have been added to help the attacking team get inside the enemy team's starting plaza.",
    "In Splatoon 3, the Rainmaker starts on the same area as before. The checkpoints are located on the main entrance to the towers and on the open area next to the ramp up. The goal is located in the open area of each team's spawn, closer to the drop. A ramp is added for access.",
    "The baskets are located on the bottom, right before the ramp up. The pit is not filled, hampering a way to the basket.",
    "Flounder Heights was revealed during a Japanese promotional trailer depicting new updates on 24 July 2015. It was released on 20 August 2015.",
    "Flounder Heights was available in the following Splatfests in Splatoon:",
    "Flounder Heights was announced to return in the 10 August 2022 Nintendo Direct and arrived in the game at the start of Chill Season 2022. The complex has been redeveloped in collaboration with the local government and industry academics, \"going greener\" in the process.[1] The stage's overall elevation was lowered, allowing for easier movement across the stage. The spawn region was also overhauled, being made much larger and more open. The walls near the Splat Zones are also no longer climbable, and the grated walkway was mostly removed.",
    "Flounder Heights was available in the following Splatfests as a Tricolor Turf War stage in Splatoon 3:",
    "Flounder Heights is a reference to the real-life flounder.",
