    "Scorch Gorge is a multiplayer stage in Splatoon 3. It is also one of the stages that can have Tricolor Turf Wars.",
    "Scorch Gorge is a stage located in a deserted wasteland (presumably within the Splatlands). The center of the stage contains a climbable platform connected with grates to other platforms.",
    "The spawn points are small raised areas that goes to another raised area. Going left leads the player to another platform that goes far to the left of the user's spawn. The right leads the user to some more raised areas for defense. Going straight leads the user down to an open area that ramps back up near the middle. Once it goes up, there is a platform to the left and a block in the middle that the user can climb up. To the right is an area that either ramps up to the middle or can be jumped up to through a block. The middle of the stage is fairly open and has a large tower in the center with grates that go towards the right of the stage, leading to the opponent's platform.",
    "In Ranked Battles, specifications for the terrain or placement of objects are different between the modes; these changes create new paths or new objects to take cover behind.",
    "The Splat Zone is located in the middle of the stage, taking up most of the middle of the stage. The stage is unchanged.",
    "The central platform is lowered compared to the Turf War version. The Tower starts on the platform, goes forward before turning right to the opposing team's left side. It then goes forward then left, then forward again until it reaches the goal. The left side of each team is now accessible by ramp and the grated pathway is now removed. The ramp to the left side is replaced with a climbable wall.",
    "The layout is similar to the Tower Control layout, but with grates leading to the enemy team's side. The Rainmaker starts on the central tower. The checkpoints are located on the right of the starting position and after the central grates on the opponent's raised area. The goal is located after the first drop from spawn. The far left side of the spawn has been shortened, and the areas immediately behind each team's left checkpoint are expanded to the left.",
    "The Clam baskets are located to the left of each team's raised block. The stage is similar to the Rainmaker layout. The only change is the area near the baskets being more flat instead of on a ramp and the center tower being its normal height.",
    "Scorch Gorge was released with the launch of Splatoon 3.",
