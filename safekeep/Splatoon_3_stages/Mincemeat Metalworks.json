    "Mincemeat Metalworks is a multiplayer stage in Splatoon 3. It is a metalwork in the Splatlands in what used to be an ocean that evaporated. It is also one of the stages that can have Tricolor Turf Wars.",
    "The spawn region of Mincemeat Metalworks are large open platforms that extend to the grates on the far right of the stage. One layer down features a large open area with a single bumper as cover. This large area is connected to the layer down by a grate bridge. The left leads to another open area that connects to the center of the stage with a sponge to retreat to the platform. Each team's platform features some walls and bumpers as cover along with the grate bridge on the right. The center of the stage features two raised areas, all connected by grates that also lead to the opponent's platform. Blocks are also added to the right of these raised areas.",
    "Following version 6.1.0 Mincemeat Metalworks received a major rework. The grate leading to the opponent's open area was made shorter and more inkable ground was added to the right of spawn. The far left now features a new raised area that allows a little more safer access to the center of the stage. The center of the stage was made much wider with more inkable ground and the pole was replaced with a small stack of blocks. The center grate is now climeable with a block and a pole was added at the center of the stage.",
    "In Ranked Battles, specifications for the terrain or placement of objects are different between the modes; these changes create new paths or new objects to take cover behind.",
    "The Splat Zone makes up most of the middle, in between the two raised areas and underneath the grated middle. The layout is the same as in Turf War.",
    "The Tower starts on top of the grated bridge. It goes into the raised areas before turning right and then forward again into the opposing team's side. It goes into the side route of the opposing team before reaching the goal. A ramp is added to allow access to the opposing team's side easier. The grated bridge connecting the opposing team's side and the raised area has been removed.",
    "The Rainmaker starts at the center of the stage. The checkpoints are located after entering the opponents' base through the grated bridge, or to the right of the starting position. The goal is located on the first drop from the spawn area. A ramp is added to the right to allow access to the pedestal.",
    "Following version 6.1.0, the pedestal and checkpoint areas remain the same. The raised area to the right of the checkpoint now has an inkable wall and the uninkable car further up can now be climbed by an added inkable wall.",
    "The Clam Basket is located on some grates on the first drop down from spawn, with a bump being added to help the player access it from below. Blocks are added to the left open area allowing another way to the basket.",
    "Following version 6.1.0, the blocks on the left were replaced by a ramp and the small ramp on each team's raised area from Rainmaker is present. These changes make access to the basket easier.",
    "Mincemeat Metalworks was released with the launch of Splatoon 3.",
    "Mincemeat Metalworks underwent a major renovation starting with version 6.1.0.",
