Its appearance is similar to that of a Slosher. When firing, ring-shaped holograms manifest around the opening at the top of the Slosher.\n\nThe Order Slosher is a weapon unlocked in Side Order, and is part of Big Man's Palette. Its base set consists of Suction Bombs and Triple Inkstrike. However, this can be changed in the Spire of Order by using a vending machine.\n\nIt has lower stats in comparison to the original Slosher, with a slower fire rate, damage, strafe speed, ink efficiency, ink coverage, and range. However, this can be upgraded through color chips in the Spire of Order.\n\n- The clear screen for the Order Slosher\n\n- The fail screen for the Order Slosher"
