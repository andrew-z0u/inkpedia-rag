    "The Order Slosher is a slosher in Splatoon 3 that is exclusively used in Side Order.",
    "The Order Slosher has a minimalist appearance, with a white molded bucket for the body of the weapon, as well as metallic silver handles and supports. Its appearance is similar to that of a Slosher. When firing, ring-shaped holograms manifest around the opening at the top of the Slosher.",
    "The Order Slosher is a weapon unlocked in Side Order, and is part of Big Man's Palette. Its base set consists of Suction Bombs and Triple Inkstrike. However, this can be changed in the Spire of Order by using a vending machine.",
    "It has lower stats in comparison to the original Slosher, with a slower fire rate, damage, strafe speed, ink efficiency, ink coverage, and range. However, this can be upgraded through color chips in the Spire of Order.",
