  "content": "The Soda Slosher is a main weapon in Splatoon and Splatoon 2. It is a Slosher with a different kit and color scheme.\n\nIt is a bucket of ink that can be swung to throw out globs of ink that leave trails behind them. The trajectory of the ink can be adjusted by aiming higher or lower than horizontally. Its globs do enough damage to splat opponents in two shots.\n\nThe Soda Slosher deals constant damage no matter how far away the ink travels, as opposed to most other classes dealing less damage as ink travels farther due to fall-off damage. However, there is still fall-off damage when targeting opponents below the player, dealing less than maximum damage.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Splatoon\n\n2.1 Data\n2.2 Quotes\n2.3 Gallery\n2.4 Demonstration\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Quotes\n\n- 2.3 Gallery\n\n- 2.4 Demonstration\n\n- 3 Splatoon 2\n\n3.1 Data\n3.2 Version history\n3.3 Quotes\n3.4 Gallery\n3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 4 Strategy\n\n- 5 Trivia\n\n- 6 Etymology\n\n6.1 Names in other languages\n6.2 Translation notes\n\n- 6.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 6.2 Translation notes\n\n- 7 References\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Quotes\n\n- 2.3 Gallery\n\n- 2.4 Demonstration\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 6.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 6.2 Translation notes\n\nThe Soda Slosher shares its overall design with the Slosher.

Notably, the Soda Slosher retains its handle hinges that other Slosher variants no longer have. This trait is shared with the Heavy Splatling Remix.\n\nSoda Slosher is derived from soda and the verb to slosh. Soda likely refers to its bright color scheme, a common design feature on soda cans and soft drinks in general. Soda is also used to separate it from the Slosher and the Slosher Deco.\n\nバケットスロッシャーソーダ Baketto Surosshā Sōda is derived from bucket, the verb to slosh and soda. Bucket Slosher Soda most likely contains the word soda for the same reasons as the English name."
