  "content": "The Sloshing Machine is a main weapon in the Splatoon series.\n\nThe Sloshing Machine launches a small mortar-like glob that is trailed by a vortex of ink. The glob leaves a path of ink while it travels, and bursts on contact with a surface or an enemy. Most notably, the vortex of ink allows the Sloshing Machine to do splash damage to enemies alongside the glob of ink if a direct hit is not landed. Notably, the vortex throws out small, non-damaging ink droplets that ink small portions of turf around where the projectile lands.\n\nThe Sloshing Machine's splash damage allows it to fulfill roles similar to that of a blaster. More specifically, it is very similar to the Rapid Blaster concerning splash damage, direct damage, range, and speed. However, unlike blaster weapons which have a large exploding splash radius at their maximum reach, the Sloshing Machine will deal splash damage to anything alongside the glob as it travels. Additionally, the heavy arc of the projectile makes the weapon ideal for dealing with enemies behind cover, or enemies atop a platform, like the tower in Tower Control. These capabilities, however, come at the cost of lower attack-speed and turf coverage when compared to more traditional sloshers.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Splatoon\n\n2.1 Data\n2.2 Version history\n2.3 Quotes\n2.4 Gallery\n2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3 Splatoon 2\n\n3.1 Data\n3.2 Version history\n3.3 Quotes\n3.4 Gallery\n3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 4 Splatoon 3\n\n4.1 Data\n\n4.1.1 Central ink glob\n4.1.2 Ink spiral\n\n\n4.2 Version history\n4.3 Quotes\n4.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n4.5 Gallery\n\n- 4.1 Data\n\n4.1.1 Central ink glob\n4.1.2 Ink spiral\n\n- 4.1.1 Central ink glob\n\n- 4.1.2 Ink spiral\n\n- 4.2 Version history\n\n- 4.3 Quotes\n\n- 4.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 4.5 Gallery\n\n- 5 Strategy\n\n- 6 Trivia\n\n- 7 Etymology\n\n7.1 Names in other languages\n7.2 Translation notes\n\n- 7.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 7.2 Translation notes\n\n- 8 References\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 4.1 Data\n\n4.1.1 Central ink glob\n4.1.2 Ink spiral\n\n- 4.1.1 Central ink glob\n\n- 4.1.2 Ink spiral\n\n- 4.2 Version history\n\n- 4.3 Quotes\n\n- 4.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 4.5 Gallery\n\n- 4.1.1 Central ink glob\n\n- 4.1.2 Ink spiral\n\n- 7.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 7.2 Translation notes\n\nThe Sloshing Machine is a small, cream-colored washing machine. It has two handles, one on the bottom and one on the top, both of which change color to match the user's ink, along with the bottom section.\n\nIn Splatoon 3, the upper section of the Sloshing Machine now entirely changes ink color while the bottom section, including the handle, are now cream-colored. The rim at the top is thicker, and the inside of the weapon has been slightly changed. On the side, four small suction cups have been added to each corner of the weapon.\n\nThe Sloshing Machine was released on 28 November 2015 at 02:00 UTC.[1][2][3] It comes in a set with Splat Bombs and the Bomb Rush.\n\n- The Sloshing Machine is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- Each attack consumes 7% of the ink tank capacity.\nThis allows players to attack 14 times before needing to refill the ink supply.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This allows players to attack 14 times before needing to refill the ink supply.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- When initially attacking in humanoid form, the first shot takes 12 frames to come out.\n\n- When attacking from squid form, the first shot takes 18 frames to come out.\n\n- The interval at which the player can repeatedly swing is 34 frames.\n\n- When attacking while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.8 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 42 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- The maximum damage of direct hits is 76.\nIndirect hits: 38\n\n- Indirect hits: 38\n\n- The minimum damage of direct hits is 38.\nIndirect hits: 38\n\n- Indirect hits: 38\n\n- The collision radius of direct hits against the environment is 1 units.\nIndirect hits: 0 units\n\n- Indirect hits: 0 units\n\n- The collision radius of direct hits against players is 2.5 units.\nIndirect hits: 5 units\n\n- Indirect hits: 5 units\n\n- Projectiles travel straight for 5 frames.\n\n- The draw radius of direct hits is 1 units.\nIndirect hits: 0 units\n\n- Indirect hits: 0 units\n\n- The paint radius of direct hits scales from 40 units at a distance of 50 units to 40 units at a distance of 150 units.\nIndirect hits: 0 units at a distance of 0 units to 0 units at a distance of 0 units.\n\n- Indirect hits: 0 units at a distance of 0 units to 0 units at a distance of 0 units.\n\n- All other paint splashes have a radius of 12 units.\n\n- This allows players to attack 14 times before needing to refill the ink supply.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- Indirect hits: 38\n\n- Indirect hits: 38\n\n- Indirect hits: 0 units\n\n- Indirect hits: 5 units\n\n- Indirect hits: 0 units\n\n- Indirect hits: 0 units at a distance of 0 units to 0 units at a distance of 0 units.\n\n[4]\n\n- ▲ Special gauge loss: 50% → 40%.\n\n- ▲ Movement speed while firing increased by about 11%.\n\nAn innovative new weapon that puts a \"spin\" on the classic Slosher model. The Sloshing Machine is sure to make your whites whiter than white and your turf inkier than inked! This weapon's attractions are the power of the main shot and the bonus ink flung out by the vortex.

Each volley of beautiful, twisting ink hits its target with plenty of power and leaves a sloppy mess everywhere. It's great for covering plenty of turf. Try using Fizzy Bombs to contain the other team's movement while you dial the Sloshing Machine up to the max. The other team will be in a spin cycle before you know it! And don't forget about your Booyah Bombs - another tool in your quest to make a mess-terpiece of the field.
