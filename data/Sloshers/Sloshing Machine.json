    "The Sloshing Machine is a main weapon in the Splatoon series.",
    "The Sloshing Machine launches a small mortar-like glob that is trailed by a vortex of ink. The glob leaves a path of ink while it travels, and bursts on contact with a surface or an enemy. Most notably, the vortex of ink allows the Sloshing Machine to do splash damage to enemies alongside the glob of ink if a direct hit is not landed. Notably, the vortex throws out small, non-damaging ink droplets that ink small portions of turf around where the projectile lands.",
    "The Sloshing Machine's splash damage allows it to fulfill roles similar to that of a blaster. More specifically, it is very similar to the Rapid Blaster concerning splash damage, direct damage, range, and speed. However, unlike blaster weapons which have a large exploding splash radius at their maximum reach, the Sloshing Machine will deal splash damage to anything alongside the glob as it travels. Additionally, the heavy arc of the projectile makes the weapon ideal for dealing with enemies behind cover, or enemies atop a platform, like the tower in Tower Control. These capabilities, however, come at the cost of lower attack-speed and turf coverage when compared to more traditional sloshers.",
    "The Sloshing Machine is a small, cream-colored washing machine. It has two handles, one on the bottom and one on the top, both of which change color to match the user's ink, along with the bottom section.",
    "In Splatoon 3, the upper section of the Sloshing Machine now entirely changes ink color while the bottom section, including the handle, are now cream-colored. The rim at the top is thicker, and the inside of the weapon has been slightly changed. On the side, four small suction cups have been added to each corner of the weapon.",
    "The Sloshing Machine was released on 28 November 2015 at 02:00 UTC.[1][2][3] It comes in a set with Splat Bombs and the Bomb Rush.",
