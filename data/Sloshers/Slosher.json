    "The Slosher is a main weapon in the Splatoon series.",
    "It is a bucket of ink that can be swung to throw out globs of ink that leave trails behind them. The trajectory of the ink can be adjusted by aiming higher or lower than horizontally. Its globs do enough damage to splat opponents in two shots.",
    "The Slosher deals constant damage no matter how far away the ink travels, as opposed to most other classes dealing less damage as ink travels farther due to fall-off damage. However, there is still fall-off damage when targeting opponents below the player, dealing less than maximum damage.",
    "The Slosher is a black bucket surrounded by metal supports that double as handles. Two springs are included in this structure, one on each side of the bucket. There is a flat arch shape attached to the back of the bucket, which conforms to its shape.",
    "In Splatoon, the supports are dark pink-purple with lighter oval spots, and a black arrow design and Inkling text on the side; the springs are orange-yellow, with a black plastic mechanism attached to it and the supports, which does not return in the other games, and the arch on the back of the bucket is black. In Splatoon 2, the supports are glossy reddish-orange, the springs are black, and the arch is silver. In Splatoon 3, the supports are glossy, have reflective sparkles, and appear to be iridescent, changing to the user's ink color at extreme viewing angles, and otherwise have a gradient from the user's current ink color tinted pink on the handle-side, to purplish magenta, to pastel dark blue on the bucket-side. How visible the color on the handle-side of the gradient is depends on the hue, intensity, and lightness of the color: some lighter and less intense colors appear almost white, while some darker colors are very intense. The springs of the Slosher in Splatoon 3 are a metallic silver, the arch on the back is black, and uniquely, the small metal loops on the supports that connect to either end of the springs are a red-orange, rather than being the same color as the rest of the frame.",
    "In all three games, the main handle is silver, but in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3, there is some black padding that covers the main part of the handle. There is a reservoir of ink inside the bucket itself that changes color to match that of the user. There is a Deco logo in white on the back of the top of the bucket.",
    "The Slosher was made available with the 2.0.0 update on 6 August 2015 at 02:00 UTC.[1][2] Its kit consists of Burst Bomb and Inkstrike. The Slosher deals a constant 70 damage no matter how far away the ink travels, or what part of the ink opponent is hit by.",
    "[3]",
    "The Slosher is the most basic Slosher-type weapon, able to fling a large amount of ink directly ahead.\nIt's also remarkably effective at splatting opponents who are up high or behind a wall! The Slosher lacks rapid-fire capabiliteis, so the Burst Bombs should help out there! And the Inkstrike special can deliver a powerful blow to unsuspecting opponents as well.(NA)",
    "The Slosher is the most basic Slosher-type weapon, able to fling a large amount of ink directly ahead.\nThis weapon type is remarkably effective at splatting opponents who are up high or behind walls! However, they don't have any rapid fire capabilities, so the Burst Bombs should help out there! And with the Inkstrike, you can deliver a powerful attack to far-off opponents as well!(EU/OC)",
    "In Splatoon 2, the Slosher returns with a new design that is primarily orange instead of pink and has a redesigned handle and suspension.[4] Its kit consists of Suction Bomb and Tenta Missiles. As of Version 4.0.0, the weapon no longer does a constant 70 damage, but will deal a maximum of 50 damage if they are hit from above by the trail of ink between the primary glob and the player.",
    "It appears in seven Octo Expansion Stations:",
    "[5]",
    "The Slosher can be a brutal weapon in the right hands. It's basically a bucket of ink that you can toss straight at an opponent! Slosher-type weapons can do things other weapons only wish they could. It's great for attacking elevated positions behind walls. It can't fire rapidly, but if you combine it with the Suction Bomb's explosion, you can defeat opponents without being seen! Reveal your opponents' locations with the Tenta Missiles, and then fire away! It's a great weapon for Slosher newbs!",
    "The Slosher returns to Splatoon 3 with a slightly updated design, with its primary color now being purple rather than orange. Its kit consists of Splat Bomb and Triple Inkstrike.",
    "It appears in three missions in Return of the Mammalians:",
    "[6]",
    "The Slosher is one of the most technologically advanced weapons I have had the privilege of demoing. I'm kidding! It's a bucket of ink! But that doesn't mean it can't be absolutely brutal in the right hands. See, slosher-type weapons are perfect for attacking enemies in elevated positions or hiding behind walls. They think they're safe, and then... SPLOOOSH! You can't rapid-fire a bucket, of course, but in conjunction with Splat Bombs, you can stop almost anyone in their tracks. And with the Triple Inkstrike special, you have the ability to blindside the other team before moving in for the splat. This loadout is a bucketload of fun!",
    "For competitive tips about the Slosher",
    "The Slosher appears as Inkling's down smash attack in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, alongside a variety of other weapons that are used in their attacks.",
    "When attacking, they charge up and swing the Slosher to the left and right to deal damage. This also coats opponents in ink but does not ink the ground. It deals much lower damage if Inkling is out of ink. In a victory scene, Inkling spins the Slosher like in Splatoon.",
    "Slosher is derived from the verb to slosh.",
    "バケットスロッシャー baketto surosshā is derived from Bucket and the verb to slosh.",
