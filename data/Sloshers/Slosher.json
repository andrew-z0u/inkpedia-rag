  "content": "The Slosher is a main weapon in the Splatoon series.\n\nIt is a bucket of ink that can be swung to throw out globs of ink that leave trails behind them. The trajectory of the ink can be adjusted by aiming higher or lower than horizontally. Its globs do enough damage to splat opponents in two shots.\n\nThe Slosher deals constant damage no matter how far away the ink travels, as opposed to most other classes dealing less damage as ink travels farther due to fall-off damage. However, there is still fall-off damage when targeting opponents below the player, dealing less than maximum damage.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Splatoon\n\n2.1 Data\n2.2 Version history\n2.3 Quotes\n2.4 Gallery\n2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3 Splatoon 2\n\n3.1 Data\n3.2 Version history\n3.3 Quotes\n3.4 Gallery\n3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 4 Splatoon 3\n\n4.1 Data\n\n4.1.1 Big ink glob\n4.1.2 Tail end\n\n\n4.2 Version history\n4.3 Quotes\n4.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n4.5 Gallery\n\n- 4.1 Data\n\n4.1.1 Big ink glob\n4.1.2 Tail end\n\n- 4.1.1 Big ink glob\n\n- 4.1.2 Tail end\n\n- 4.2 Version history\n\n- 4.3 Quotes\n\n- 4.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 4.5 Gallery\n\n- 5 Strategy\n\n- 6 Super Smash Bros.

Two springs are included in this structure, one on each side of the bucket. There is a flat arch shape attached to the back of the bucket, which conforms to its shape.\n\nIn Splatoon, the supports are dark pink-purple with lighter oval spots, and a black arrow design and Inkling text on the side; the springs are orange-yellow, with a black plastic mechanism attached to it and the supports, which does not return in the other games, and the arch on the back of the bucket is black. In Splatoon 2, the supports are glossy reddish-orange, the springs are black, and the arch is silver. In Splatoon 3, the supports are glossy, have reflective sparkles, and appear to be iridescent, changing to the user's ink color at extreme viewing angles, and otherwise have a gradient from the user's current ink color tinted pink on the handle-side, to purplish magenta, to pastel dark blue on the bucket-side. How visible the color on the handle-side of the gradient is depends on the hue, intensity, and lightness of the color: some lighter and less intense colors appear almost white, while some darker colors are very intense. The springs of the Slosher in Splatoon 3 are a metallic silver, the arch on the back is black, and uniquely, the small metal loops on the supports that connect to either end of the springs are a red-orange, rather than being the same color as the rest of the frame.\n\nIn all three games, the main handle is silver, but in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3, there is some black padding that covers the main part of the handle. There is a reservoir of ink inside the bucket itself that changes color to match that of the user. There is a Deco logo in white on the back of the top of the bucket.\n\nThe Slosher was made available with the 2.0.0 update on 6 August 2015 at 02:00 UTC.[1][2] Its kit consists of Burst Bomb and Inkstrike. The Slosher deals a constant 70 damage no matter how far away the ink travels, or what part of the ink opponent is hit by.\n\n- The Slosher is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- Each attack consumes 7% of the ink tank capacity.\nThis allows players to attack 14 times before needing to refill the ink supply.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This allows players to attack 14 times before needing to refill the ink supply.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- When initially attacking in humanoid form, the first shot takes 12 frames to come out.\n\n- When attacking from squid form, the first shot takes 18 frames to come out.\n\n- The interval at which the player can repeatedly swing is 30 frames.\n\n- When attacking while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.5 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 40 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- The maximum damage of the thick part of the trail is 70.\nBig ink glob: 70\nThin part of the trail: 40\n\n- Big ink glob: 70\n\n- Thin part of the trail: 40\n\n- The minimum damage of the thick part of the trail is 30.\nBig ink glob: 30\nThin part of the trail: 20\n\n- Big ink glob: 30\n\n- Thin part of the trail: 20\n\n- The collision radius of the thick part of the trail against the environment is 5 units.\nBig ink glob: 8 units\nThin part of the trail: 4 units\n\n- Big ink glob: 8 units\n\n- Thin part of the trail: 4 units\n\n- The collision radius of the thick part of the trail against players is 7 units.\nBig ink glob: 10 units\nThin part of the trail: 6 units\n\n- Big ink glob: 10 units\n\n- Thin part of the trail: 6 units\n\n- Projectiles travel straight for 2 frames.\n\n- The draw radius of the thick part of the trail is 12 units.\nBig ink glob: 21 units\nThin part of the trail: 6 units\n\n- Big ink glob: 21 units\n\n- Thin part of the trail: 6 units\n\n- The paint radius of the thick part of the trail scales from 13 units at a distance of 50 units to 13 units at a distance of 150 units.\nBig ink glob: 37 units at a distance of 50 units to 32 units at a distance of 150 units.\nThin part of the trail: 10 units at a distance of 20 units to 10 units at a distance of 80 units.\n\n- Big ink glob: 37 units at a distance of 50 units to 32 units at a distance of 150 units.\n\n- Thin part of the trail: 10 units at a distance of 20 units to 10 units at a distance of 80 units.\n\n- All other paint splashes have a radius of 0 units.\n\n- This allows players to attack 14 times before needing to refill the ink supply.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- Big ink glob: 70\n\n- Thin part of the trail: 40\n\n- Big ink glob: 30\n\n- Thin part of the trail: 20\n\n- Big ink glob: 8 units\n\n- Thin part of the trail: 4 units\n\n- Big ink glob: 10 units\n\n- Thin part of the trail: 6 units\n\n- Big ink glob: 21 units\n\n- Thin part of the trail: 6 units\n\n- Big ink glob: 37 units at a distance of 50 units to 32 units at a distance of 150 units.\n\n- Thin part of the trail: 10 units at a distance of 20 units to 10 units at a distance of 80 units.\n\n[3]\n\n- ▲ Damage against Rainmaker shields increased by about 33%.\n\n- ▲ Special gauge loss: 50% → 40%\n\n- ▲ Reduced time needed to fire by about 20%.\n\n- ▲ Reduced the amount of time a player suffers reduced movement after firing a shot by 26%.\n\nThe Slosher is the most basic Slosher-type weapon, able to fling a large amount of ink directly ahead.\nIt's also remarkably effective at splatting opponents who are up high or behind a wall!

As of Version 4.0.0, the weapon no longer does a constant 70 damage, but will deal a maximum of 50 damage if they are hit from above by the trail of ink between the primary glob and the player.\n\nIt appears in seven Octo Expansion Stations:\n\n- B16 Pop Rock Station\n\n- C06 Bust 'n' Move Station\n\n- D06 C01 Radical Rails Station\n\n- E11 Bodacious Rotation Station\n\n- J03 D08 Girl Power Station (canned)\n\n- J06 D11 Ink & Watch Station\n\n- J07 Outrageous Station\n\n- The Slosher is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 145.

It's basically a bucket of ink that you can toss straight at an opponent! Slosher-type weapons can do things other weapons only wish they could. It's great for attacking elevated positions behind walls. It can't fire rapidly, but if you combine it with the Suction Bomb's explosion, you can defeat opponents without being seen! Reveal your opponents' locations with the Tenta Missiles, and then fire away!

I'm kidding! It's a bucket of ink! But that doesn't mean it can't be absolutely brutal in the right hands. See, slosher-type weapons are perfect for attacking enemies in elevated positions or hiding behind walls. They think they're safe, and then... SPLOOOSH! You can't rapid-fire a bucket, of course, but in conjunction with Splat Bombs, you can stop almost anyone in their tracks. And with the Triple Inkstrike special, you have the ability to blindside the other team before moving in for the splat.
