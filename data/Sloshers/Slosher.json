    "The Slosher is a main weapon in the Splatoon series.",
    "It is a bucket of ink that can be swung to throw out globs of ink that leave trails behind them. The trajectory of the ink can be adjusted by aiming higher or lower than horizontally. Its globs do enough damage to splat opponents in two shots.",
    "The Slosher deals constant damage no matter how far away the ink travels, as opposed to most other classes dealing less damage as ink travels farther due to fall-off damage. However, there is still fall-off damage when targeting opponents below the player, dealing less than maximum damage.",
    "The Slosher is a black bucket surrounded by metal supports that double as handles. Two springs are included in this structure, one on each side of the bucket. There is a flat arch shape attached to the back of the bucket, which conforms to its shape.",
    "In Splatoon, the supports are dark pink-purple with lighter oval spots, and a black arrow design and Inkling text on the side; the springs are orange-yellow, with a black plastic mechanism attached to it and the supports, which does not return in the other games, and the arch on the back of the bucket is black. In Splatoon 2, the supports are glossy reddish-orange, the springs are black, and the arch is silver. In Splatoon 3, the supports are glossy, have reflective sparkles, and appear to be iridescent, changing to the user's ink color at extreme viewing angles, and otherwise have a gradient from the user's current ink color tinted pink on the handle-side, to purplish magenta, to pastel dark blue on the bucket-side. How visible the color on the handle-side of the gradient is depends on the hue, intensity, and lightness of the color: some lighter and less intense colors appear almost white, while some darker colors are very intense. The springs of the Slosher in Splatoon 3 are a metallic silver, the arch on the back is black, and uniquely, the small metal loops on the supports that connect to either end of the springs are a red-orange, rather than being the same color as the rest of the frame.",
    "In all three games, the main handle is silver, but in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3, there is some black padding that covers the main part of the handle. There is a reservoir of ink inside the bucket itself that changes color to match that of the user. There is a Deco logo in white on the back of the top of the bucket.",
    "The Slosher was made available with the 2.0.0 update on 6 August 2015 at 02:00 UTC.[1][2] Its kit consists of Burst Bomb and Inkstrike. The Slosher deals a constant 70 damage no matter how far away the ink travels, or what part of the ink opponent is hit by.",

    "The Slosher appears as Inkling's down smash attack in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, alongside a variety of other weapons that are used in their attacks.",
    "When attacking, they charge up and swing the Slosher to the left and right to deal damage. This also coats opponents in ink but does not ink the ground. It deals much lower damage if Inkling is out of ink. In a victory scene, Inkling spins the Slosher like in Splatoon.",
    "- In Splatoon,\nThe Slosher was first discovered in the June 24th datamine.\nThe Slosher, alongside the Heavy Splatling, would be the first entirely new weapons to be added into the Splatoon franchise, making their debut on 6 August 2015 at 02:00 UTC, with the release of version 2.0.0.",
    "- In Splatoon 3,\nThe Slosher was one of the weapons available to use in the Splatoon 3 Splatfest World Premiere.\nDespite appearing purple in-game, the plain color texture of the bucket is red.",
    "- The Slosher and the Heavy Splatling are the only weapons not made by the Splat brand to have their design changed every Splatoon game.",
    "- The Slosher was one of the weapons to be included in the \"Best Splatoon Weapons\" list on page 35 of Scholastic's \"Game On 2017.\" It is the third weapon to be listed and includes the description: \"Simple but extremely effective when used correctly, the Slosher delivers a heavy dose of paint that, unlike most other weapons in Splatoon, deals more damage the further it travels.\"",
