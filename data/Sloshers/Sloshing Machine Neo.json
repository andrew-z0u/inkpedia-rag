The only difference between the two is that the Sloshing Machine Neo has a sticker bearing the Neo logo on its side. In Splatoon 3 the place of the logo is changed to be on top of the weapon, and the bottom part of it is now black.\n\nThe Sloshing Machine Neo was released on 9 January 2016 at 02:00 UTC.[1] It comes in a set with Point Sensors and the Inkzooka.\n\n- The Sloshing Machine Neo is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- Each attack consumes 7% of the ink tank capacity.\nThis allows players to attack 14 times before needing to refill the ink supply.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This allows players to attack 14 times before needing to refill the ink supply.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- When initially attacking in humanoid form, the first shot takes 12 frames to come out.\n\n- When attacking from squid form, the first shot takes 18 frames to come out.\n\n- The interval at which the player can repeatedly swing is 34 frames.\n\n- When attacking while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.8 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 42 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- The maximum damage of direct hits is 76.\nIndirect hits: 38\n\n- Indirect hits: 38\n\n- The minimum damage of direct hits is 38.\nIndirect hits: 38\n\n- Indirect hits: 38\n\n- The collision radius of direct hits against the environment is 1 units.\nIndirect hits: 0 units\n\n- Indirect hits: 0 units\n\n- The collision radius of direct hits against players is 2.5 units.\nIndirect hits: 5 units\n\n- Indirect hits: 5 units\n\n- Projectiles travel straight for 5 frames.\n\n- The draw radius of direct hits is 1 units.\nIndirect hits: 0 units\n\n- Indirect hits: 0 units\n\n- The paint radius of direct hits scales from 40 units at a distance of 50 units to 40 units at a distance of 150 units.\nIndirect hits: 0 units at a distance of 0 units to 0 units at a distance of 0 units.\n\n- Indirect hits: 0 units at a distance of 0 units to 0 units at a distance of 0 units.\n\n- All other paint splashes have a radius of 12 units.\n\n- This allows players to attack 14 times before needing to refill the ink supply.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- Indirect hits: 38\n\n- Indirect hits: 38\n\n- Indirect hits: 0 units\n\n- Indirect hits: 5 units\n\n- Indirect hits: 0 units\n\n- Indirect hits: 0 units at a distance of 0 units to 0 units at a distance of 0 units.\n\n[2]\n\n- ▲ Special gauge loss: 50% → 40%.\n\n- ▲ Movement speed while firing increased by about 11%.\n\nThe Sloshing Machine Neo features a special sticker from the manufacturer.

Its stats are the same, but you can use the Point Sensor to reveal the location of opponents to your entire team! And for any opponents that manage to evade you, use the Splat-Bomb Launcher to send 'em back to their spawn point! Recommended to tactical players who want to support their team and splat their enemies!\n\nAs with the regular version, the main weapon is a great tool for striking foes who are cowering behind cover, and the addition of a Point Sensor means that nobody can hide from you for long.\n\nOn top of that, the Splat Bomb Launcher(sic) special helps you rapidly secure turf for your team.\n\n- Promotional image\n\nThe Sloshing Machine Neo returns in Splatoon 3 as part of the Drizzle Season 2023. Its design is slightly updated, with its bottom part now being black. Its kit consists of Point Sensor and Trizooka, which is based on its Splatoon kit.\n\n- The Sloshing Machine Neo is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 14.7. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The ink consumption of 9.2% per shot allows the user to fire 10 times on a full ink tank.\n\n- After firing, there is a 42 frame cooldown before ink starts refilling.\n\n- When initially attacking in humanoid form, the first shot takes 12 frames to come out.\n\n- When initially attacking from swim form, the first shot takes 18 frames to come out.\n\n- The movement speed while firing is set to 0.07 units per frame.\n\n- The time between consecutive swings is 38 frames.\n\n- The interval between firing and being able to enter swim form or use a sub weapon is 20 frames.\n\n- The effective range is about 13.07 units while grounded and 12.92 while airborne.\nThis is the distance in which the crosshair will change shape when looking at an opponent and is otherwise arbitrary since sloshers do not use traditional falloff mechanics.\n\n- This is the distance in which the crosshair will change shape when looking at an opponent and is otherwise arbitrary since sloshers do not use traditional falloff mechanics.\n\n- This is the distance in which the crosshair will change shape when looking at an opponent and is otherwise arbitrary since sloshers do not use traditional falloff mechanics.\n\n- The group consists of only 1 projectile.\n\n- The group starts spawning as soon as the lifting animation ends.\n\n- The  projectile spawns with an initial speed of 1.4737 units per frame while grounded, and 1.4563 units per frame while airborne. It flies straight at this speed for 5 frames.\nAfter this, the velocity is set to 10.0 units per frame if it is not already below this number, and decreases by 10% every frame, including the first frame in which it stops flying straight. Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed more and fall faster.\n\n- After this, the velocity is set to 10.0 units per frame if it is not already below this number, and decreases by 10% every frame, including the first frame in which it stops flying straight.

It has the same basic ability to slosh ink all over the place. But it has a new look and a new loadout to play with—including the Point Sensor sub! Throw one down to mark enemy positions, then put 'em in the splat cycle with your main. If you've got stubborn enemy ink stains that just won't come out, that's when it's time to fire up the Trizooka special. I'll put it this way... it's not for delicates! This set is great for players who want to put the other team in a permanent press and see a sparkling clean sweep at the end.\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Sloshing Machine Neo.\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Sloshing_Machine_Neo_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nModel of the Sloshing Machine Neo rotating (Link to file)\n\n- In Splatoon, at 28,500 cash, the Sloshing Machine Neo is the most expensive slosher and the third most expensive weapon.\n\n- The Sloshing Machine Neo has the Point Sensor as its sub weapon in all three Splatoon games.\n\nSloshing Machine Neo is a pun derived from the verb to slosh and Washing Machine, plus the suffix Neo, Ancient Greek for new. The suffix Neo is also used to differentiate it from the Sloshing Machine. This trait is shared among the other alternate sets of the Neo brand.\n\nスクリュースロッシャーネオ Sukuryū Surosshā Neo is derived from Screw and the verb to slosh, plus the suffix Neo. Screw likely refers to spinning motion of this weapon's projectile. Like the English name, Neo is also used to differentiate it from Screw Slosher."
