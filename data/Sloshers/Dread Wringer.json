    "The Dread Wringer is a main weapon in Splatoon 3, created by the weapon brand \"D\".",
    "The Dread Wringer is a mop bucket colored to the user's ink color, with a wringing bar splitting its opening. Its handle and wringing mechanism are made of grayish metal with black grips.",
    "The Dread Wringer was released on 1 September 2023 at 00:00 UTC. It comes in a set with Suction Bombs and Reefslider. It fires two globs of ink in a burst with one press of the fire button.",
    "[1][2]",
    "I'm pleased to introduce an entirely new slosher...the Dread Wringer! This double-muzzled slosher actually fires—or rather, sloshes—two bursts of ink at once.\nThere's a slight delay before the second burst releases, which gives you an interesting choice. Fire straight ahead and hope for a powerful direct hit, or...\nTry sweeping the nozzles horizontally to attack or ink a wider area. The choice is yours!\nOh, I haven't gotten to the loadout yet! With both Suction Bombs and the Reefslider special, you have an explosive combination that more than makes up for lower firepower.\nIt may take some getting used to, but if you can master the way of the double slosh, I think you'll find this can be a go-to weapon set that you'll have tons of fun with!",
    "For competitive tips about the Dread Wringer",
    "The Dread Wringer's name is a pun on the idiom \"dead ringer\", meaning \"exact duplicate\", referencing the two sloshes it fires in one swing, and the word \"wring\", referencing the wringing function of a mop bucket.",
