Its handle and wringing mechanism are made of grayish metal with black grips.\n\nThe Dread Wringer was released on 1 September 2023 at 00:00 UTC. It comes in a set with Suction Bombs and Reefslider. It fires two globs of ink in a burst with one press of the fire button.\n\n- The Dread Wringer is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 15.5. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The ink consumption of 9% per shot allows the user to fire 11 times on a full ink tank.\n\n- After firing, there is a 50 frame cooldown before ink starts refilling.\n\n- When initially attacking in humanoid form, the first shot takes 16 frames to come out.\n\n- When initially attacking from swim form, the first shot takes 22 frames to come out.\n\n- The movement speed while firing is set to 0.04 units per frame.\n\n- The time between consecutive swings is 45 frames.\n\n- The interval between firing and being able to enter swim form or use a sub weapon is 16 frames.\n\n- The effective range is about 14.94 units while grounded and 14.49 while airborne.\nThis is the distance in which the crosshair will change shape when looking at an opponent and is otherwise arbitrary since sloshers do not use traditional falloff mechanics.\n\n- This is the distance in which the crosshair will change shape when looking at an opponent and is otherwise arbitrary since sloshers do not use traditional falloff mechanics.\n\n- This is the distance in which the crosshair will change shape when looking at an opponent and is otherwise arbitrary since sloshers do not use traditional falloff mechanics.\n\n- The group contains 8 projectiles that spawn consecutively 1 frame apart from each other.\n\n- The group starts spawning as soon as the lifting animation ends.\n\n- The first projectile spawns with an initial speed of 1.85 units per frame while grounded, and 1.79 units per frame while airborne. It flies straight at this speed for 2 frames.\nAfter this, the velocity is set to 10.0 units per frame if it is not already below this number, and decreases by 10% every frame, including the first frame in which it stops flying straight. Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed more and fall faster.\nEach subsequent projectile spawns with an initial speed that is 0.225 units per frame slower than the last.\n\n- After this, the velocity is set to 10.0 units per frame if it is not already below this number, and decreases by 10% every frame, including the first frame in which it stops flying straight. Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed more and fall faster.\n\n- Each subsequent projectile spawns with an initial speed that is 0.225 units per frame slower than the last.\n\n- The projectiles deal 48 damage.\nDamage falloff starts when a projectile falls 1.5 units below its initial spawning point. It will lose damage the further it falls until it has fallen to 7.625 units below its spawning point, at which point it will deal 35 damage.\n\n- Damage falloff starts when a projectile falls 1.5 units below its initial spawning point. It will lose damage the further it falls until it has fallen to 7.625 units below its spawning point, at which point it will deal 35 damage.\n\n- The first projectile spawns with an initial collision radius of 0.1 units for players and 0.09 units for the stage. Over the course of 5 frames, the collision radius for players changes to 1.0 units, and over the course of 4 frames, the collision radius for the stage changes to 0.9 units.\nFor subsequent projectiles, the initial collision radius is 0.0085 units smaller than the previous projectile for players, and 0.0085 units smaller for the stage. After the collision size changes, the radius is 0.085 units smaller than the previous projectile for players, and 0.085 units smaller for the stage.\n\n- For subsequent projectiles, the initial collision radius is 0.0085 units smaller than the previous projectile for players, and 0.0085 units smaller for the stage.

This double-muzzled slosher actually fires—or rather, sloshes—two bursts of ink at once.\nThere's a slight delay before the second burst releases, which gives you an interesting choice. Fire straight ahead and hope for a powerful direct hit, or...\nTry sweeping the nozzles horizontally to attack or ink a wider area. The choice is yours!\nOh, I haven't gotten to the loadout yet! With both Suction Bombs and the Reefslider special, you have an explosive combination that more than makes up for lower firepower.\nIt may take some getting used to, but if you can master the way of the double slosh, I think you'll find this can be a go-to weapon set that you'll have tons of fun with!\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Dread Wringer.\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Dread_Wringer_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nModel of the Dread Wringer rotating (link to file)\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Dread_Wringer_demonstration.mp4\n\n\nThe Dread Wringer in action (link to file)\n\nFor competitive tips about the Dread Wringer\n\n- The Dread Wringer is not included in Return of the Mammalians due to it being added post-release.\n\n- The Dread Wringer, and its variant, the Dread Wringer D, are two of the only weapons to be showed with a specific player ink color in their 2D and 3D icons; they are displayed as yellow, while other color-changing weapons are displayed as gray.\n\nThe Dread Wringer's name is a pun on the idiom \"dead ringer\", meaning \"exact duplicate\", referencing the two sloshes it fires in one swing, and the word \"wring\", referencing the wringing function of a mop bucket."
