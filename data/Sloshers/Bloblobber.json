  "content": "The Bloblobber is a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3.\n\nIt is a slosher-type weapon that shoots a row of four small bubbles which are able to bounce along the ground and off walls. The weapon boasts fairly long range and is able to splat opponents in a single shot if all four bubbles connect. The bubbles do not suffer from any type of damage decay, doing a consistent 30 damage regardless of range. The distance the bubbles are able to travel varies greatly depending on the amount of obstructions in their way, the bubbles will gradually shrink as they travel before vanishing. Colliding with walls or inclining surfaces will reduce the travel range of the bubble, as well as cause them to shrink faster.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Splatoon 2\n\n2.1 Data\n2.2 Version history\n2.3 Quotes\n2.4 Gallery\n2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3 Splatoon 3\n\n3.1 Data\n\n3.1.1 First bubble\n3.1.2 Last 3 bubbles\n\n\n3.2 Version history\n3.3 Quotes\n3.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n3.5 Gallery\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n3.1.1 First bubble\n3.1.2 Last 3 bubbles\n\n- 3.1.1 First bubble\n\n- 3.1.2 Last 3 bubbles\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 3.5 Gallery\n\n- 4 Strategy\n\n- 5 Trivia\n\n- 6 Etymology\n\n6.1 Names in other languages\n6.2 Translation notes\n6.3 Internal names\n\n- 6.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 6.2 Translation notes\n\n- 6.3 Internal names\n\n- 7 References\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n3.1.1 First bubble\n3.1.2 Last 3 bubbles\n\n- 3.1.1 First bubble\n\n- 3.1.2 Last 3 bubbles\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 3.5 Gallery\n\n- 3.1.1 First bubble\n\n- 3.1.2 Last 3 bubbles\n\n- 6.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 6.2 Translation notes\n\n- 6.3 Internal names\n\nThe Bloblobber is a small black bathtub with a white inside.

Read the whole story on my Bloblobber blob law blog! Ahem... The design was inspired by a bathtub, and each fling of it unleashes four bouncing blobs! The Splash Wall sub provides cover from enemy attacks, and the Ink Storm special allows you to zone enemies and support your team! This set's a must for anyone looking to draw attention with bounding, lawful blobs, while also reminding your opponents to take a bath!\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- Promotional render\n\n- An Octoling (backmost) holding a Bloblobber.\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S2_Bloblobber_Promo_Video1.mp4\n\n\nPromotional video (link to file)\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S2_Bloblobber_Datamined_video.mp4\n\n\nAn early version of the Bloblobber hacked into the game (link to file)\n\nThe Bloblobber returns in Splatoon 3, retaining its design from Splatoon 2.

What's more, each lob fires four blobs - that's an awful lot of lawful blobs! Once your tongue is untied, you can use the Bloblobber to target a single enemy - perhaps your friend Rob - or an entire mob. Truly, it's a versatile weapon for every job. And although they sound out of place here, the Sprinkler sub weapon and Ink Storm special actually complement this set quite nicely. Like butter melting over corn on the cob!\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- Promotional render of the Bloblobber\n\n- Tableturf Battle card art\n\nFor competitive tips about the Bloblobber\n\n- According to datamining of the original Splatoon, the Slosher was originally going to be called the Bloblobber before its announcement.\n\n- The Bloblobber is the only slosher that can splat opponents with one press of .\n\n- Early data mining of the Bloblobber (still under the codename \"bathtub\" at the time) showed it throwing three bouncing blobs in three directions, similar to the Tri-Slosher. Each blob would do 35 damage, and the center blob was significantly larger than the other two.\nThese blobs looked similar to those produced by Blobby Octotroopers.\n\n- These blobs looked similar to those produced by Blobby Octotroopers.\n\n- Due to being released after it, the Bloblobber, along with the Explosher, Ballpoint Splatling, and Nautilus are the only main weapons not included in the Octo Expansion.\n\n- As of version 5.5.0 of Splatoon 2, the Bloblobber, along with the Explosher and the Ballpoint Splatling, are the only main weapons in Splatoon 2 to possess the dubious distinction of exclusively receiving nerfs through the various updates that followed their releases.\n\n- Sheldon's introduction speech in Splatoon 2 (and possibly the weapon name itself) is a direct reference to the character Bob Loblaw in Arrested Development, a lawyer who lobs law bombs, whose name sounds like blah-blah-blah on its own and like blah-blah-blah-blah-blah when discussing his law blog.\n\n- These blobs looked similar to those produced by Blobby Octotroopers.\n\nThe Bloblobber is a combination of Blob and Lobber, coming together to mean \"One that lobs blobs\", referring to what the weapon does, as well as rhyming. The \"verb\" Bloblob can be separated into two blobs as well."
