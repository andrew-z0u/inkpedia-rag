    "The Bloblobber is a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3.",
    "It is a slosher-type weapon that shoots a row of four small bubbles which are able to bounce along the ground and off walls. The weapon boasts fairly long range and is able to splat opponents in a single shot if all four bubbles connect. The bubbles do not suffer from any type of damage decay, doing a consistent 30 damage regardless of range. The distance the bubbles are able to travel varies greatly depending on the amount of obstructions in their way, the bubbles will gradually shrink as they travel before vanishing. Colliding with walls or inclining surfaces will reduce the travel range of the bubble, as well as cause them to shrink faster.",
    "The Bloblobber is a small black bathtub with a white inside. Unlike a traditional bathtub, the Bloblobber has no legs and has extra supports and a handle. It is also small enough to hold.",
    "The Bloblobber was released on 1 August 2018 at 00:00 UTC.[1] It comes with Splash Wall and Ink Storm.",

    "- According to datamining of the original Splatoon, the Slosher was originally going to be called the Bloblobber before its announcement.",
    "- The Bloblobber is the only slosher that can splat opponents with one press of .",
    "- Early data mining of the Bloblobber (still under the codename \"bathtub\" at the time) showed it throwing three bouncing blobs in three directions, similar to the Tri-Slosher. Each blob would do 35 damage, and the center blob was significantly larger than the other two.\nThese blobs looked similar to those produced by Blobby Octotroopers.",
    "- Due to being released after it, the Bloblobber, along with the Explosher, Ballpoint Splatling, and Nautilus are the only main weapons not included in the Octo Expansion.",
    "- As of version 5.5.0 of Splatoon 2, the Bloblobber, along with the Explosher and the Ballpoint Splatling, are the only main weapons in Splatoon 2 to possess the dubious distinction of exclusively receiving nerfs through the various updates that followed their releases.",
    "- Sheldon's introduction speech in Splatoon 2 (and possibly the weapon name itself) is a direct reference to the character Bob Loblaw in Arrested Development, a lawyer who lobs law bombs, whose name sounds like blah-blah-blah on its own and like blah-blah-blah-blah-blah when discussing his law blog.",
    "The Bloblobber is a combination of Blob and Lobber, coming together to mean \"One that lobs blobs\", referring to what the weapon does, as well as rhyming. The \"verb\" Bloblob can be separated into two blobs as well."
