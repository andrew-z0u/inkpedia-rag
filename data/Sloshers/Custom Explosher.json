The only difference between the two is that the Custom Explosher has a sticker bearing the Custom logo on its side.\n\nIn Splatoon 3, the Custom sticker is still present, but the color of the weapon is beige instead of olive green.\n\nThe Custom Explosher was announced on 24 November 2018. It was added to the game on 5 December 2018 as part of the version 4.3.0 release.[1]\n\n- The Custom Explosher is a heavyweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 207.

It works like the standard model but comes with a Point Sensor for tracking down foes. And if your opponents are closing in, pop your Baller special and roll out the welcome mat! Are you the type who's eager to greet opponents near or far with inky hospitality? Then give this set a try!\n\n- Promotional image.\n\n- An Inkling holding the Custom Explosher during the Family vs. Friends Splatfest.\n\nThe Custom Explosher returns in Splatoon 3 with a new design and beige color. The weapon was added in the Fresh Season 2024 update. Its kit comes with Splash Walls and the Triple Splashdown.\n\n- The Custom Explosher is a heavyweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 20.7. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The ink consumption of 11.7% per shot allows the user to fire 8 times on a full ink tank.\n\n- After firing, there is a 70 frame cooldown before ink starts refilling.\n\n- When initially attacking in humanoid form, the first shot takes 16 frames to come out.\n\n- When initially attacking from swim form, the first shot takes 22 frames to come out.\n\n- The movement speed while firing is set to 0.045 units per frame.\n\n- The time between consecutive swings is 55 frames.\n\n- The interval between firing and being able to enter swim form or use a sub weapon is 35 frames.\n\n- The explosion created when the projectile hits the ground deals 35 damage in a radius of 2.8 units.\n\n- The paint created by the blast has a radius of 4.5 units if it lands within 21.0 units of its spawning location. Beyond this, the painting radius is reduced until it reaches a radius of 4.095 units after a travel distance of 23.0 units, and will not have its painting radius reduced further.\n\n- The effective range is about 19.15 units while grounded and 18.87 while airborne.\nThis is the distance in which the crosshair will change shape when looking at an opponent and is otherwise arbitrary since sloshers do not use traditional falloff mechanics.\n\n- This is the distance in which the crosshair will change shape when looking at an opponent and is otherwise arbitrary since sloshers do not use traditional falloff mechanics.\n\n- This is the distance in which the crosshair will change shape when looking at an opponent and is otherwise arbitrary since sloshers do not use traditional falloff mechanics.\n\n- The group consists of only 1 projectile.\n\n- The group starts spawning as soon as the lifting animation ends.\n\n- The  projectile spawns with an initial speed of 1.4105 units per frame while grounded, and 1.38975 units per frame while airborne. It flies straight at this speed for 8 frames.\nAfter this, the velocity is set to 10.0 units per frame if it is not already below this number, and decreases by 10% every frame, including the first frame in which it stops flying straight. Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed more and fall faster.\n\n- After this, the velocity is set to 10.0 units per frame if it is not already below this number, and decreases by 10% every frame, including the first frame in which it stops flying straight.

Over the course of 5 frames, the collision radius for players changes to 0.4 units, and over the course of 4 frames, the collision radius for the stage changes to 0.25 units.\n\n- The damage is not reduced by the projectile falling.\n\n[3]\n\n- ▲ Points to fill special gauge: 200 → 190.\n\nThe Custom Explosher is built with custom-tooled parts to create a new take on the original! It's basically the same Explosher you know and love, but this one comes with the Splash Wall sub to keep enemies at bay in close combat. And if your opponents push the issue, simply retort in the form of a devastating Triple Splashdown! I recommend this set to anyone with a customer-first approach. Go to your \"clients\" where they live, and deliver the hard sell!\n\n- The Octoling in the center is sitting on the Custom Explosher.\n\n- Promotional render.\n\n- 2D icon.\n\n- Tableturf Battle art.\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Custom_Explosher_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nModel of the Custom Explosher rotating (link to file)"
