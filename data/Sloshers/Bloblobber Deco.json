Paired with the Sprinkler sub, you've got a slosher that can cover an astounding amount of turf! But that's not all! Add the Suction Bomb-Launcher into the mix and you've got an arsenal for unleashing unprecedented waves of ink! If you enjoy floating your team to victory while soaking foes in floods of fluid, this just might be the set for you!\n\n- Promotional render\n\nThe Bloblobber Deco returns in Splatoon 3 as part of the Drizzle Season 2023, with a new design that has yellow supports instead of black. Its kit consists of Angle Shooter and Kraken Royale.\n\n- The Bloblobber Deco is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 15. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The ink consumption of 8% per shot allows the user to fire 12 times on a full ink tank.\n\n- After firing, there is a 40 frame cooldown before ink starts refilling.\n\n- When initially attacking in humanoid form, the first shot takes 6 frames to come out.\n\n- When initially attacking from swim form, the first shot takes 12 frames to come out.\n\n- The movement speed while firing is set to 0.05 units per frame.\n\n- The time between consecutive swings is 32 frames.\n\n- The interval between firing and being able to enter swim form or use a sub weapon is 25 frames.\n\n- The effective range is about 11.71 units while grounded and 11.11 while airborne.\nThis is the distance in which the crosshair will change shape when looking at an opponent and is otherwise arbitrary since sloshers do not use traditional falloff mechanics.\n\n- This is the distance in which the crosshair will change shape when looking at an opponent and is otherwise arbitrary since sloshers do not use traditional falloff mechanics.\n\n- This is the distance in which the crosshair will change shape when looking at an opponent and is otherwise arbitrary since sloshers do not use traditional falloff mechanics.\n\n- The group consists of only 1 projectile.\n\n- The group starts spawning as soon as the lifting animation ends.\n\n- The  projectile spawns with an initial speed of 0.53982 units per frame while grounded, and 0.51 units per frame while airborne. It flies straight at this speed for 3 frames.\nAfter this, the velocity is set to 10.0 units per frame if it is not already below this number, and decreases by 1% every frame, including the first frame in which it stops flying straight.

Over the course of 5 frames, the collision radius for players changes to 0.52 units, and over the course of 4 frames, the collision radius for the stage changes to 0.5 units.\nFor subsequent projectiles, the initial collision radius is 0.003 units smaller than the previous projectile for players, and 0.003 units smaller for the stage.

Check out the Bloblobber Deco! It lobs blobs just like a regular Bloblobber but has a fun new look. And did I mention the new loadout? This one comes with the Angle Shooter sub, which can both deal damage directly and reveal tricky hidden enemies. I should also talk about the Kraken Royale special, but really...the ability to transform into a massive killer squid or octo at a moment's notice kind of speaks for itself. I recommend this set for maximum blob lobbing with a dash of mobility and a heaping helping of giant squid!\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Bloblobber Deco.\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Bloblobber_Deco_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nModel of the Bloblobber Deco rotating (Link to file)\n\nFor competitive tips about the Bloblobber Deco\n\n- Early datamining in Splatoon 2 showed the Bloblobber Deco was going to have the Fizzy Bomb, but this was later changed to the Sprinkler."
