    "The Bloblobber Deco is a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3. It is a Deco-branded variant of the Bloblobber.",
    "The Bloblobber Deco is nearly identical in appearance to the Bloblobber.",
    "In Splatoon 2, the Bloblobber Deco has some stickers bearing the Deco logo on the supports.",
    "In Splatoon 3, the supports are colored yellow and the stickers are colored navy blue.",
    "The Bloblobber Deco was announced on 24 November 2018. It was added to the game on 5 December 2018 as part of version 4.3.0.[1]",
    "[2]",
    "The Bloblobber Deco is a custom version of the original with a cool new sticker slapped on for good measure! Paired with the Sprinkler sub, you've got a slosher that can cover an astounding amount of turf! But that's not all! Add the Suction Bomb-Launcher into the mix and you've got an arsenal for unleashing unprecedented waves of ink! If you enjoy floating your team to victory while soaking foes in floods of fluid, this just might be the set for you!",
    "The Bloblobber Deco returns in Splatoon 3 as part of the Drizzle Season 2023, with a new design that has yellow supports instead of black. Its kit consists of Angle Shooter and Kraken Royale.",
    "[3]",
    "Love the Bloblobber but not the way it looks? Check out the Bloblobber Deco! It lobs blobs just like a regular Bloblobber but has a fun new look. And did I mention the new loadout? This one comes with the Angle Shooter sub, which can both deal damage directly and reveal tricky hidden enemies. I should also talk about the Kraken Royale special, but really...the ability to transform into a massive killer squid or octo at a moment's notice kind of speaks for itself. I recommend this set for maximum blob lobbing with a dash of mobility and a heaping helping of giant squid!",
