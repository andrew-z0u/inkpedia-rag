More specifically, it is similar to the Dynamo Roller with respect to flick speed, range, and ink consumption. The projectiles from this weapon are very similar to those of the Sloshing Machine, albeit much larger, with a significantly slower travel speed, and the projectile will not arc, instead traveling straight forward and falling straight down at its maximum range. The ink trail left by the projectiles is dropped in chunks, rather than gradually.\n\nThe defining factor that sets the Grizzco Slosher apart is its unique ability to pierce through any armor, similar to the Sting Ray. The Grizzco Slosher can hit targets directly and continue to travel through them. This piercing ability also allows the weapon to attack through Scrapper and Drizzler armor, Slammin' Lids and their force fields, and the ink walls of Steel Eels and Grillers. It can also deal direct damage to Flyfish and Steelheads, even if they are not in a vulnerable state. The weapon has a very high ink consumption, only allowing for a maximum of 4 shots with a full tank.\n\nThe Grizzco Slosher is somewhat similar in appearance to the Sloshing Machine. However, the paint job on the Grizzco Slosher seems to have been removed, revealing the metal beneath. The Grizzco Slosher has four mismatched metal tubes sticking out from the sides, a white Grizzco logo on the side, and some extra tubes and wires in the back.\n\nIn Splatoon 3, along with the other Grizzco weapons, it has four yellowish tubes of ink attached to one side.\n\nThe Grizzco Slosher is a rare weapon only available during Salmon Run Wildcard rotations.
