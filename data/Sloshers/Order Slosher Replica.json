The Order Slosher Replica's stats, sub weapon, and special weapon are identical to those of the Slosher.\n\nTo unlock the Order Slosher Replica, the player must complete Side Order with Big Man's Palette.\n\n- The Order Slosher Replica is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 14.5. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The ink consumption of 7.6% per shot allows the user to fire 13 times on a full ink tank.\n\n- After firing, there is a 40 frame cooldown before ink starts refilling.\n\n- When initially attacking in humanoid form, the first shot takes 12 frames to come out.\n\n- When initially attacking from swim form, the first shot takes 18 frames to come out.\n\n- The movement speed while firing is set to 0.04 units per frame.\n\n- The time between consecutive swings is 29 frames.\n\n- The interval between firing and being able to enter swim form or use a sub weapon is 16 frames.\n\n- The effective range is about 14.12 units while grounded and 13.55 while airborne.\nThis is the distance in which the crosshair will change shape when looking at an opponent and is otherwise arbitrary since sloshers do not use traditional falloff mechanics.\n\n- This is the distance in which the crosshair will change shape when looking at an opponent and is otherwise arbitrary since sloshers do not use traditional falloff mechanics.\n\n- This is the distance in which the crosshair will change shape when looking at an opponent and is otherwise arbitrary since sloshers do not use traditional falloff mechanics.\n\n- The group contains 4 projectiles that spawn consecutively 1 frame apart from each other.\n\n- The group starts spawning as soon as the lifting animation ends.\n\n- The first projectile spawns with an initial speed of 1.7609 units per frame while grounded, and 1.6852 units per frame while airborne. It flies straight at this speed for 2 frames.\nAfter this, the velocity is set to 10.0 units per frame if it is not already below this number, and decreases by 10% every frame, including the first frame in which it stops flying straight. Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed more and fall faster.\nEach subsequent projectile spawns with an initial speed that is 0.16 units per frame slower than the last.\n\n- After this, the velocity is set to 10.0 units per frame if it is not already below this number, and decreases by 10% every frame, including the first frame in which it stops flying straight. Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed more and fall faster.\n\n- Each subsequent projectile spawns with an initial speed that is 0.16 units per frame slower than the last.\n\n- The projectiles deal 70 damage.\nDamage falloff starts when a projectile falls 1.5 units below its initial spawning point. It will lose damage the further it falls until it has fallen to 7.625 units below its spawning point, at which point it will deal 50 damage.\n\n- Damage falloff starts when a projectile falls 1.5 units below its initial spawning point. It will lose damage the further it falls until it has fallen to 7.625 units below its spawning point, at which point it will deal 50 damage.\n\n- The first projectile spawns with an initial collision radius of 0.085 units for players and 0.08 units for the stage. Over the course of 5 frames, the collision radius for players changes to 0.85 units, and over the course of 4 frames, the collision radius for the stage changes to 0.8 units.\nFor subsequent projectiles, the initial collision radius is 0.012 units smaller than the previous projectile for players, and 0.012 units smaller for the stage. After the collision size changes, the radius is 0.12 units smaller than the previous projectile for players, and 0.12 units smaller for the stage.\n\n- For subsequent projectiles, the initial collision radius is 0.012 units smaller than the previous projectile for players, and 0.012 units smaller for the stage. After the collision size changes, the radius is 0.12 units smaller than the previous projectile for players, and 0.12 units smaller for the stage.\n\n- After this, the velocity is set to 10.0 units per frame if it is not already below this number, and decreases by 10% every frame, including the first frame in which it stops flying straight.

It flies straight at this speed for 2 frames.\nAfter this, the velocity is set to 10.0 units per frame if it is not already below this number, and decreases by 10% every frame, including the first frame in which it stops flying straight. Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed more and fall faster.\nEach subsequent projectile spawns with an initial speed that is 0.2 units per frame slower than the last.\n\n- After this, the velocity is set to 10.0 units per frame if it is not already below this number, and decreases by 10% every frame, including the first frame in which it stops flying straight. Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed more and fall faster.\n\n- Each subsequent projectile spawns with an initial speed that is 0.2 units per frame slower than the last.\n\n- The projectiles deal 50 damage.\nThe damage is not reduced by the projectile falling.\n\n- The damage is not reduced by the projectile falling.\n\n- The first projectile spawns with an initial collision radius of 0.045 units for players and 0.04 units for the stage. Over the course of 5 frames, the collision radius for players changes to 0.45 units, and over the course of 4 frames, the collision radius for the stage changes to 0.4 units.\nFor subsequent projectiles, the initial collision radius is 0.005 units smaller than the previous projectile for players, and 0.005 units smaller for the stage. After the collision size changes, the radius is 0.05 units smaller than the previous projectile for players, and 0.05 units smaller for the stage.\n\n- For subsequent projectiles, the initial collision radius is 0.005 units smaller than the previous projectile for players, and 0.005 units smaller for the stage.
