    "The Order Slosher Replica is a main weapon in Splatoon 3. It is a reskin of the Slosher and a direct successor to the Splatoon 2 Hero Slosher Replica.",
    "The Order Slosher Replica is designed to look like a simplified version of the Slosher, containing only white and gray colors.",
    "The Order Slosher Replica comes with Splat Bombs and Triple Inkstrike. The Order Slosher Replica's stats, sub weapon, and special weapon are identical to those of the Slosher.",
    "To unlock the Order Slosher Replica, the player must complete Side Order with Big Man's Palette.",

    "- The matchmaking range is 14.5. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.",
    "- The ink consumption of 7.6% per shot allows the user to fire 13 times on a full ink tank.",
    "- After firing, there is a 40 frame cooldown before ink starts refilling.",

    "- The time between consecutive swings is 29 frames.",
    "- The interval between firing and being able to enter swim form or use a sub weapon is 16 frames.",
    "- The effective range is about 14.12 units while grounded and 13.55 while airborne.\nThis is the distance in which the crosshair will change shape when looking at an opponent and is otherwise arbitrary since sloshers do not use traditional falloff mechanics.",

Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed more and fall faster.\nEach subsequent projectile spawns with an initial speed that is 0.16 units per frame slower than the last.",
    "- The projectiles deal 70 damage.\nDamage falloff starts when a projectile falls 1.5 units below its initial spawning point. It will lose damage the further it falls until it has fallen to 7.625 units below its spawning point, at which point it will deal 50 damage.",
