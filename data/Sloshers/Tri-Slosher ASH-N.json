The handle is now a dark brown and a packet resembling a field ration packet stamped with Barazushi's logo is attached to the right side.\n\nThe Tri-Slosher ASH-N makes its first appearance in Splatoon 3 with identical stats to the Tri-Slosher. It comes with Splat Bomb and Splattercolor Screen.\n\n- The Tri-Slosher ASH-N is a lightweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 11. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The ink consumption of 6% per shot allows the user to fire 16 times on a full ink tank.\n\n- After firing, there is a 35 frame cooldown before ink starts refilling.\n\n- When initially attacking in humanoid form, the first shot takes 12 frames to come out.\n\n- When initially attacking from swim form, the first shot takes 18 frames to come out.\n\n- The movement speed while firing is set to 0.066 units per frame.\n\n- The time between consecutive swings is 23 frames.\n\n- The interval between firing and being able to enter swim form or use a sub weapon is 20 frames.\n\n- The effective range is about 11.04 units while grounded and 10.45 while airborne.\nThis is the distance in which the crosshair will change shape when looking at an opponent and is otherwise arbitrary since sloshers do not use traditional falloff mechanics.\n\n- This is the distance in which the crosshair will change shape when looking at an opponent and is otherwise arbitrary since sloshers do not use traditional falloff mechanics.\n\n- This is the distance in which the crosshair will change shape when looking at an opponent and is otherwise arbitrary since sloshers do not use traditional falloff mechanics.\n\n- The group contains 4 projectiles that spawn consecutively 1 frame apart from each other.\n\n- The group starts spawning as soon as the lifting animation ends.\n\n- The first projectile spawns with an initial speed of 1.2229 units per frame while grounded, and 1.1523 units per frame while airborne. It flies straight at this speed for 3 frames.\nAfter this, the velocity is set to 10.0 units per frame if it is not already below this number, and decreases by 10% every frame, including the first frame in which it stops flying straight. Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed more and fall faster.\nEach subsequent projectile spawns with an initial speed that is 0.16 units per frame slower than the last.\n\n- After this, the velocity is set to 10.0 units per frame if it is not already below this number, and decreases by 10% every frame, including the first frame in which it stops flying straight. Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed more and fall faster.\n\n- Each subsequent projectile spawns with an initial speed that is 0.16 units per frame slower than the last.\n\n- The projectiles deal 62 damage.\nDamage falloff starts when a projectile falls 1.5 units below its initial spawning point. It will lose damage the further it falls until it has fallen to 8.0 units below its spawning point, at which point it will deal 35 damage.\n\n- Damage falloff starts when a projectile falls 1.5 units below its initial spawning point. It will lose damage the further it falls until it has fallen to 8.0 units below its spawning point, at which point it will deal 35 damage.\n\n- The first projectile spawns with an initial collision radius of 0.09 units for players and 0.07 units for the stage. Over the course of 5 frames, the collision radius for players changes to 0.9 units, and over the course of 4 frames, the collision radius for the stage changes to 0.7 units.\nFor subsequent projectiles, the initial collision radius is 0.01 units smaller than the previous projectile for players, and 0.01 units smaller for the stage. After the collision size changes, the radius is 0.1 units smaller than the previous projectile for players, and 0.1 units smaller for the stage.\n\n- For subsequent projectiles, the initial collision radius is 0.01 units smaller than the previous projectile for players, and 0.01 units smaller for the stage.

It flies straight at this speed for 3 frames.\nAfter this, the velocity is set to 10.0 units per frame if it is not already below this number, and decreases by 10% every frame, including the first frame in which it stops flying straight. Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed more and fall faster.\nEach subsequent projectile spawns with an initial speed that is 0.25 units per frame slower than the last.\n\n- After this, the velocity is set to 10.0 units per frame if it is not already below this number, and decreases by 10% every frame, including the first frame in which it stops flying straight.

Designed by Barazushi using an ultra-light alloy, it oozes class like only a bucket can. Plus, if you use your Splat Bombs and the Splattercolor Screen well, you'll be able to distract opponents and create opportunities to dump that triple bucket of ink on 'em. I recommend this set to anyone who likes to burn the candle at both ends on the battlefield and leave only a blanket of ash behind.\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- Promotional image of the Splatlands Collection - Barazushi weapons\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Tri-slosher_ASH-N_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nPromotional video (link to file)\n\nThe brand stylization \"ASH-N\" could be interpreted as ashen, regarding the weapon's coloration, or ashing."
