  "content": "The Hero Slosher Replica is a main weapon in Splatoon 2.\n\nThe Slosher is a bucket of ink that can be swung to splatter turf and enemies in a straight line. The trajectory of the ink can be adjusted to strike enemies behind walls or on above high surfaces. It is strong enough to splat opponents in only two shots.\n\nThe Slosher deals constant damage no matter how far away the ink travels, unlike rollers and shooters which deal less damage as ink travels farther due to fall-off damage. However, there is still fall-off damage when targeting opponents below the player, dealing less than maximum damage.\n\nIn addition to this, more ink will be spread the farther away the ink travels, allowing for an easier time to get around and move in the ink.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Splatoon 2\n\n2.1 Data\n2.2 Version history\n2.3 Quotes\n2.4 Gallery\n2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3 Strategy\n\n- 4 Trivia\n\n- 5 Names in other languages\n\n5.1 Translation notes\n\n- 5.1 Translation notes\n\n- 6 References\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 5.1 Translation notes\n\nThe Hero Slosher Replica shares its overall design with the Slosher. However, the Hero Slosher Replica has yellow supports and dark teal springs. The design of the Hero Slosher Replica bears more resemblance to the design of the Slosher in Splatoon despite being exclusive to Splatoon 2.\n\nThe Hero Slosher Replica is visually identical to the Level 1 Hero Slosher, but is simply a re-skinned Slosher. Therefore unlike the switchable sub weapons of the Hero Slosher, it comes with Suction Bomb and the Tenta Missiles. As of 4.0.0, the weapon no longer does a consistent 70 damage, but will deal a max of 50 damage if they are hit from above by the trail of ink between the primary glob and the player. To unlock the Hero Slosher Replica, the player must complete every level with the Hero Slosher in Octo Canyon, in which it becomes available for purchase at Ammo Knights.\n\n- The Hero Slosher Replica is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 145.

I've been carrying out extensive tests and have finally created a weapon with stats worthy of something truly legendary... Sadly, I couldn't get approval for mass production as the guys down there couldn't wrap their heads around my advanced schematics... So I slapped some leftover parts on a Slosher and here we are! How about that blue suspension, huh? Please, please try it out!\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- Hero weapons, with the Hero Slosher Replica in the bottom left\n\nFor competitive tips about the Hero Slosher Replica\n\nNote: the strategy advice for Slosher also applies to Hero Slosher Replica, so they share the same strategy page.\n\n- Though a minor difference, the design of the Hero Slosher and its Replica are based on the Slosher from Splatoon instead of Splatoon 2. Note the black plastic guard connecting the handle and bucket."
