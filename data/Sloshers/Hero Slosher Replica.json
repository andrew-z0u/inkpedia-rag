    "The Hero Slosher Replica is a main weapon in Splatoon 2.",
    "The Slosher is a bucket of ink that can be swung to splatter turf and enemies in a straight line. The trajectory of the ink can be adjusted to strike enemies behind walls or on above high surfaces. It is strong enough to splat opponents in only two shots.",
    "The Slosher deals constant damage no matter how far away the ink travels, unlike rollers and shooters which deal less damage as ink travels farther due to fall-off damage. However, there is still fall-off damage when targeting opponents below the player, dealing less than maximum damage.",
    "In addition to this, more ink will be spread the farther away the ink travels, allowing for an easier time to get around and move in the ink.",
    "The Hero Slosher Replica shares its overall design with the Slosher. However, the Hero Slosher Replica has yellow supports and dark teal springs. The design of the Hero Slosher Replica bears more resemblance to the design of the Slosher in Splatoon despite being exclusive to Splatoon 2.",
    "The Hero Slosher Replica is visually identical to the Level 1 Hero Slosher, but is simply a re-skinned Slosher. Therefore unlike the switchable sub weapons of the Hero Slosher, it comes with Suction Bomb and the Tenta Missiles. As of 4.0.0, the weapon no longer does a consistent 70 damage, but will deal a max of 50 damage if they are hit from above by the trail of ink between the primary glob and the player. To unlock the Hero Slosher Replica, the player must complete every level with the Hero Slosher in Octo Canyon, in which it becomes available for purchase at Ammo Knights.",

    "- Though a minor difference, the design of the Hero Slosher and its Replica are based on the Slosher from Splatoon instead of Splatoon 2. Note the black plastic guard connecting the handle and bucket."
