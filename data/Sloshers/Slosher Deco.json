  "content": "The Slosher Deco is a main weapon in the Splatoon series. It is the Deco-branded version of the Slosher.\n\nThe Slosher Deco is a bucket full of ink that can be swung to splatter turf and enemies in a thick, straight line. The trajectory of the ink can be adjusted to strike enemies behind walls or on above high surfaces. It is strong enough to splat opponents in only two shots.\n\nThe Slosher Deco deals constant damage no matter how far away the ink travels, as opposed to rollers and shooters dealing less damage as ink travel farther due to fall-off damage. However, there is still fall-off damage when targeting opponents below the player, dealing less than maximum damage.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Splatoon\n\n2.1 Data\n2.2 Version history\n2.3 Quotes\n2.4 Gallery\n2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3 Splatoon 2\n\n3.1 Data\n3.2 Version history\n3.3 Quotes\n3.4 Gallery\n3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 4 Splatoon 3\n\n4.1 Data\n\n4.1.1 Big ink glob\n4.1.2 Tail end\n\n\n4.2 Version history\n4.3 Quotes\n4.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n4.5 Gallery\n\n- 4.1 Data\n\n4.1.1 Big ink glob\n4.1.2 Tail end\n\n- 4.1.1 Big ink glob\n\n- 4.1.2 Tail end\n\n- 4.2 Version history\n\n- 4.3 Quotes\n\n- 4.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 4.5 Gallery\n\n- 5 Strategy\n\n- 6 Trivia\n\n- 7 Etymology\n\n7.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 7.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 8 References\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 4.1 Data\n\n4.1.1 Big ink glob\n4.1.2 Tail end\n\n- 4.1.1 Big ink glob\n\n- 4.1.2 Tail end\n\n- 4.2 Version history\n\n- 4.3 Quotes\n\n- 4.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 4.5 Gallery\n\n- 4.1.1 Big ink glob\n\n- 4.1.2 Tail end\n\n- 7.1 Names in other languages\n\nThe Slosher Deco is nearly identical in appearance to the Slosher. The only difference between the two is that the Slosher Deco has some stickers bearing the Deco logo on the supports. In Splatoon 3, the supports are recolored, fading from black-to-blue, then to the user's ink color.\n\nThe Slosher Deco was released on 25 November 2015 at 02:00 UTC.[1][2][3] The Slosher Deco comes with Splash Walls and the Kraken.

Well, check out the Slosher Deco! It has cool stickers on it! I joke, but no one will be laughing when you master the Angle Shooter sub and tag all your enemies for easy splatting by your teammates. And if you use the Zipcaster to reach high ground, you can rain down ink all day long like only a slosher main can. Your bucket will runneth over with this set, so be sure to give it a try if you like sloshing!\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Slosher Deco.\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Slosher_Deco_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nThe Slosher Deco model rotating (Link to file)\n\nFor competitive tips about the Slosher Deco\n\n- The Slosher Deco is the first non-shooter weapon in Splatoon 3 to receive the Angle Shooter sub weapon.\n\n- Splatoon 3 marks the first time in the series that the Slosher Deco has differed in color from its base variant, being blue instead of purple.\nIn previous games, it matched the Slosher's color: both were pink in Splatoon, and both were orange in Splatoon 2.\n\n- In previous games, it matched the Slosher's color: both were pink in Splatoon, and both were orange in Splatoon 2.\n\n- In previous games, it matched the Slosher's color: both were pink in Splatoon, and both were orange in Splatoon 2.\n\nSlosher Deco is derived from the verb to slosh and Deco, short for either Decorated or Decoration. Deco may also refer to Art Deco. The suffix Deco is also used to differentiate it from the Slosher. This trait is shared among the other alternate sets of the Deco brand.\n\nバケットスロッシャーデコ Baketto Surosshā Deko is derived from Bucket and the verb to slosh, as well as Deco."
