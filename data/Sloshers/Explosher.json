    "The Explosher is a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3. It is a heavy slosher-type weapon that shoots an accurate, slow, long-range projectile.",
    "The weapon fires projectiles in an arc similar to the Sloshing Machine, though instead of an indirect splash radius that follows the projectile, the Explosher fires a projectile that explodes upon hitting a surface.[1] Unlike other projectiles in the game, the Explosher's projectiles do not dissipate nor explode upon a direct hit on a target, instead piercing through the target completely until it hits a solid surface. Additionally, the main projectile does not suffer falloff damage.",
    "The Explosher is a jet heater fitted into a large olive-green jerrycan with a metal pipe going around it and serving as the handle. It has an orange shock absorber spring on each side and on the front is a pressure gauge and a shuttered opening serving as the weapon's muzzle. The inside of the Explosher radiates light with the user's ink color, appearing to be superheated. There is also heat distortion rising from the muzzle.",
    "In Splatoon 3, the Explosher received a redesign. The muzzle's shell has been removed to reveal machinery and an orange wire, and its tip and shuttered opening are now gold.",
    "The Explosher was released on 1 July 2018 at 00:00 UTC.[2] Its kit consists of the Sprinkler and the Bubble Blower.",
    "[3]",
    "This Explosher is a reporpoised industrial heater modified to fling piping-hot ink long distances! Its shots explode on contact with walls and the ground, so it's handy for hitting foes who like to hide! The Sprinkler sub is a great way to expand your turf-inking power while making it easier for allies to move! Pile on the pressure with the Bubble Blower by cutting off their escape route and taking them out! Using the sub and special weapons with help from your team makes this a really aggressive set!",
    "The Explosher returns in Splatoon 3 with a new design. Its kit has Point Sensor and Ink Storm.",
    "It appears in two missions in Return of the Mammalians:",
    "[4]",
    "The Explosher is a reporpoised industrial heater modified to fling piping-hot ink long distances! Its shots explode on contact with walls and the ground, so it's handy for hitting foes who like to hide! And with the Point Sensor sub, you can reveal enemy positions to your allies, or queue 'em up for your own ink bath, courtesy of the Explosher. For super-slippery customers who might be slinking along in their own ink, fire up the Ink Storm and watch 'em scramble as they're revealed. With so many ways to direct the action, I recommend this loadout for all aspiring team captains!",
    "Explosher is a portmanteau between explosion and slosher.",
