    "The Explosher is a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3. It is a heavy slosher-type weapon that shoots an accurate, slow, long-range projectile.",
    "The weapon fires projectiles in an arc similar to the Sloshing Machine, though instead of an indirect splash radius that follows the projectile, the Explosher fires a projectile that explodes upon hitting a surface.[1] Unlike other projectiles in the game, the Explosher's projectiles do not dissipate nor explode upon a direct hit on a target, instead piercing through the target completely until it hits a solid surface. Additionally, the main projectile does not suffer falloff damage.",
    "The Explosher is a jet heater fitted into a large olive-green jerrycan with a metal pipe going around it and serving as the handle. It has an orange shock absorber spring on each side and on the front is a pressure gauge and a shuttered opening serving as the weapon's muzzle. The inside of the Explosher radiates light with the user's ink color, appearing to be superheated. There is also heat distortion rising from the muzzle.",
    "In Splatoon 3, the Explosher received a redesign. The muzzle's shell has been removed to reveal machinery and an orange wire, and its tip and shuttered opening are now gold.",
    "The Explosher was released on 1 July 2018 at 00:00 UTC.[2] Its kit consists of the Sprinkler and the Bubble Blower.",

    "- The Explosher's shots cannot pierce through Salmon Run bosses.",
    "- The Explosher's shots can destroy the Flyfish's open missile launchers upon impact, as if they were Splat Bombs.",

    "- Promotional image",

    "The Explosher returns in Splatoon 3 with a new design. Its kit has Point Sensor and Ink Storm.",
    "It appears in two missions in Return of the Mammalians:",
    "- 0105 Relic Restoration",
    "- 0512 You'll Go Far If You Shoot Far",

    "- Promotional render",
    "- 2D icon",
    "- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Explosher.",
    "- Unused early version of the Explosher's Tableturf Battle card. In it, the Explosher features its Splatoon 2 color scheme.",

    "- The Explosher was first shown during the Splatoon 2 World Championship 2018, as part of the announcement of updates extending until December 2018.",
    "- The Explosher's stats, under the codename \"Washtub\" were datamined from the version 3.0.0 data prior to its official announcement.",
    "- The Explosher is fairly unique in a variety of ways.\nIt is the only non-rare main weapon capable of destroying the Flyfish's launchers without assistance from a player's bomb or special.\nIt can also deal damage to Mudmouths.\nDue to the weapon being based on a jet heater, a visible heat distortion effect can be seen around the barrel of the weapon, making it the only weapon to have this effect.",
    "- Due to being released after it, the Explosher, along with the Bloblobber, Ballpoint Splatling, and Nautilus are the only main weapons not included in the Octo Expansion.",
    "- As of version 5.5.0, the Explosher, along with the Ballpoint Splatling and the Bloblobber, are the only main weapons in Splatoon 2 to possess the dubious distinction of exclusively receiving nerfs through the various updates that followed their release.",
    "Explosher is a portmanteau between explosion and slosher."
