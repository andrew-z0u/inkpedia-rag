    "The Hero Slosher is a slosher in Splatoon 2 that is exclusively used in Octo Canyon.",
    "The Hero Slosher looks like the Slosher but with a more futuristic design with the black and lime-green color scheme shared with all the Hero Weapons. The main bucket is black, the supports are yellow, and the springs change color depending on the upgrades.",
    "Like all hero weapons of Splatoon 2, the Hero Slosher comes with switchable sub weapons of Splat Bombs, Curling Bombs and Autobombs and can be upgraded. It is loaned by Sheldon during the level Octoseeker Shakedown and can be used in missions after beating the level. Beating all missions in Octo Canyon with the Hero Slosher unlocks the replica variant for purchase at Ammo Knights.",
    "The Hero Slosher Replica is a reward in Splatoon 2 unlocked for purchase at Ammo Knights by beating all missions with the Hero Slosher. It is a slosher-type main weapon and is visually identical to the Hero Slosher. Despite its unique appearance, it is simply a reskin of the Slosher, sharing the same stats and loadout, Suction Bombs and Tenta Missiles.",

    "- Despite being introduced in Splatoon 2, the Hero Slosher's appearance is mostly based on Slosher as it appears in Splatoon. Notably, the Hero Slosher's handle has hinges like the old Slosher design instead of a hingeless design. Similarly, the Soda Slosher completely retains its appearance in Splatoon (including its handle hinges) when it returns in Splatoon 2. This trait is shared with the Hero Splatling and its replica.",
    "- The Splatoon 2 design of the Hero Slosher appears in a banner in Splatoon 3."
