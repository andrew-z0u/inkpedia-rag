  "content": "The Tri-Slosher is a main weapon in the Splatoon series.\n\nIt is a slosher-type weapon that is separated into three sections and is similar in appearance as a Japanese brush washer bucket. As its appearance implies, it can throw in three different directions. It covers a straight line forward and two splotches to the side, though the damage dealt by connecting multiple of the splotches is the same as that dealt by connecting one. The range is short compared to other sloshers.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Splatoon\n\n2.1 Data\n2.2 Version history\n2.3 Quotes\n2.4 Gallery\n2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3 Splatoon 2\n\n3.1 Data\n3.2 Version history\n3.3 Quotes\n3.4 Gallery\n3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 4 Splatoon 3\n\n4.1 Data\n\n4.1.1 Far central ink glob\n4.1.2 Close central ink glob\n4.1.3 Side ink globs\n\n\n4.2 Version history\n4.3 Quotes\n4.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n4.5 Gallery\n\n- 4.1 Data\n\n4.1.1 Far central ink glob\n4.1.2 Close central ink glob\n4.1.3 Side ink globs\n\n- 4.1.1 Far central ink glob\n\n- 4.1.2 Close central ink glob\n\n- 4.1.3 Side ink globs\n\n- 4.2 Version history\n\n- 4.3 Quotes\n\n- 4.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 4.5 Gallery\n\n- 5 Strategy\n\n- 6 Trivia\n\n- 7 Etymology\n\n7.1 Names in other languages\n7.2 Translation notes\n\n- 7.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 7.2 Translation notes\n\n- 8 References\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 4.1 Data\n\n4.1.1 Far central ink glob\n4.1.2 Close central ink glob\n4.1.3 Side ink globs\n\n- 4.1.1 Far central ink glob\n\n- 4.1.2 Close central ink glob\n\n- 4.1.3 Side ink globs\n\n- 4.2 Version history\n\n- 4.3 Quotes\n\n- 4.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 4.5 Gallery\n\n- 4.1.1 Far central ink glob\n\n- 4.1.2 Close central ink glob\n\n- 4.1.3 Side ink globs\n\n- 7.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 7.2 Translation notes\n\nThe Tri-Slosher is a plastic bucket that is divided into multiple sections with the user's ink in them.\n\nIn Splatoon and Splatoon 2, the bucket is green, its shape is circular with three triangular sections and a circular section in the middle, the handle is lime green, and there is a black attachment at the back of the bucket that serves as a handhold. In Splatoon 2, the bucket is a lighter green than in Splatoon. Like the Slosher, there is a reservoir of ink inside the bucket which changes color to match that of the user's.\n\nIn Splatoon 3, the Tri-Slosher has a new design. The bucket is now blue, square-shaped, divided into three rectangular sections by two vertical lines, and the handle is yellow.\n\nThe Tri-Slosher was released on 26 September 2015 at  02:00 UTC.[1][2] It comes with Disruptors and the Bubbler.\n\n- The Tri-Slosher is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- Each attack consumes 6% of the ink tank capacity.\nThis allows players to attack 16 times before needing to refill the ink supply.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This allows players to attack 16 times before needing to refill the ink supply.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- When initially attacking in humanoid form, the first shot takes 12 frames to come out.\n\n- When attacking from squid form, the first shot takes 18 frames to come out.\n\n- The interval at which the player can repeatedly swing is 26 frames.\n\n- When attacking while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.7 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 35 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- The maximum damage of the center splash is 62.\nFirst side splash: 62\nSecond side splash: 62\n\n- First side splash: 62\n\n- Second side splash: 62\n\n- The minimum damage of the center splash is 30.\nFirst side splash: 30\nSecond side splash: 30\n\n- First side splash: 30\n\n- Second side splash: 30\n\n- The collision radius of the center splash against the environment is 7 units.\nFirst side splash: 7 units\nSecond side splash: 5 units\n\n- First side splash: 7 units\n\n- Second side splash: 5 units\n\n- The collision radius of the center splash against players is 9 units.\nFirst side splash: 8 units\nSecond side splash: 7 units\n\n- First side splash: 8 units\n\n- Second side splash: 7 units\n\n- Projectiles travel straight for 3 frames.\n\n- The draw radius of the center splash is 14 units.\nFirst side splash: 8 units\nSecond side splash: 10 units\n\n- First side splash: 8 units\n\n- Second side splash: 10 units\n\n- The paint radius of the center splash scales from 30 units at a distance of 50 units to 25 units at a distance of 120 units.\nFirst side splash: 14 units at a distance of 50 units to 12 units at a distance of 85 units.\nSecond side splash: 14 units at a distance of 50 units to 14 units at a distance of 80 units.\n\n- First side splash: 14 units at a distance of 50 units to 12 units at a distance of 85 units.\n\n- Second side splash: 14 units at a distance of 50 units to 14 units at a distance of 80 units.\n\n- All other paint splashes have a radius of 7.5 units.\n\n- This allows players to attack 16 times before needing to refill the ink supply.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- First side splash: 62\n\n- Second side splash: 62\n\n- First side splash: 30\n\n- Second side splash: 30\n\n- First side splash: 7 units\n\n- Second side splash: 5 units\n\n- First side splash: 8 units\n\n- Second side splash: 7 units\n\n- First side splash: 8 units\n\n- Second side splash: 10 units\n\n- First side splash: 14 units at a distance of 50 units to 12 units at a distance of 85 units.\n\n- Second side splash: 14 units at a distance of 50 units to 14 units at a distance of 80 units.\n\n[3]\n\n- ▲ Damage against Rainmaker shields increased by about 33%.\n\n- ▼ Special gauge loss: 50% → 60%.\n\nThe Tri-Slosher is Slosher-type weapon with three angles of attack!

Since the ink is being split in three, it does reduce the attack power slightly, but if you follow up with a Burst Bomb, you're good to go! All that's left is to push forward with the Ink Armor!

Anyway, since the Tri-Slosher offers a broader attack, the inkpower is a bit less than your basic Slosher. But when you've got Toxic Mist to slow enemies down, it's barely even a problem. Add in the Inkjet, and you're packing plenty of power.
