    "The Tri-Slosher is a main weapon in the Splatoon series.",
    "It is a slosher-type weapon that is separated into three sections and is similar in appearance as a Japanese brush washer bucket. As its appearance implies, it can throw in three different directions. It covers a straight line forward and two splotches to the side, though the damage dealt by connecting multiple of the splotches is the same as that dealt by connecting one. The range is short compared to other sloshers.",
    "The Tri-Slosher is a plastic bucket that is divided into multiple sections with the user's ink in them.",
    "In Splatoon and Splatoon 2, the bucket is green, its shape is circular with three triangular sections and a circular section in the middle, the handle is lime green, and there is a black attachment at the back of the bucket that serves as a handhold. In Splatoon 2, the bucket is a lighter green than in Splatoon. Like the Slosher, there is a reservoir of ink inside the bucket which changes color to match that of the user's.",
    "In Splatoon 3, the Tri-Slosher has a new design. The bucket is now blue, square-shaped, divided into three rectangular sections by two vertical lines, and the handle is yellow.",
    "The Tri-Slosher was released on 26 September 2015 at  02:00 UTC.[1][2] It comes with Disruptors and the Bubbler.",
