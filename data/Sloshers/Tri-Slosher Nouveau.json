And if the sticker isn't selling it, let me tell you about the loadout... First up, you get Fizzy Bombs, enabling you to close the distance between you and your opponents quickly. If you've used sloshers before, you already know that close equals splat! And you can amp up the mobility even more with the Tacticooler! Now you're gliding around the map like a manta ray with rocket boosters, and your teammates are getting a boost too. Don't even get me started on the ink coverage. It's also great! So I hope you give this set a try. It can really turn the tide in battle!\n\n- The Octoling on the left poses with the Tri-Slosher Nouveau\n\n- The Tri-Slosher Nouveau being shown off in the Fresh Season 2023 promotional poster\n\n- Promotional render\n\n- 2D icon.\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Tri-Slosher Nouveau.\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Tri-Slosher_Nouveau_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nModel of the Tri-Slosher Nouveau rotating (Link to file)\n\nFor competitive tips about the Tri-Slosher Nouveau\n\n- Early datamining of Splatoon 2 showed that the Tri-Slosher Nouveau was meant to have Autobomb Launcher as its special, and the icon for this special was also found. The data miners even recorded footage of it in action on the test range. However, it was later changed to have the Ink Storm, and the Autobomb Launcher was instead released with the Carbon Roller Deco and Light Tetra Dualies.\n\nTri-Slosher Nouveau is derived from the verb to slosh, Tri, a shortening meaning Three, and Nouveau, french for New. Nouveau may also refer to Art Nouveau. The suffix Nouveau is also used to differentiate it from the Tri-Slosher. This trait is shared among the other alternate sets of the Nouveau brand.\n\nヒッセン・ヒュー Hissen Hyū means Brush Washer Hue. 筆洗 Hissen are segmented buckets that are used for cleaning paintbrushes. ヒュー Hyū refers to hue. Like Nouveau in the English name, Hue is used to differentiate it from the Tri-Slosher."
