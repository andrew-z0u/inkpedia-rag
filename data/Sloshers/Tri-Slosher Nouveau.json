    "- Early datamining of Splatoon 2 showed that the Tri-Slosher Nouveau was meant to have Autobomb Launcher as its special, and the icon for this special was also found. The data miners even recorded footage of it in action on the test range. However, it was later changed to have the Ink Storm, and the Autobomb Launcher was instead released with the Carbon Roller Deco and Light Tetra Dualies.",
    "Tri-Slosher Nouveau is derived from the verb to slosh, Tri, a shortening meaning Three, and Nouveau, french for New. Nouveau may also refer to Art Nouveau. The suffix Nouveau is also used to differentiate it from the Tri-Slosher. This trait is shared among the other alternate sets of the Nouveau brand.",
    "ヒッセン・ヒュー Hissen Hyū means Brush Washer Hue. 筆洗 Hissen are segmented buckets that are used for cleaning paintbrushes. ヒュー Hyū refers to hue. Like Nouveau in the English name, Hue is used to differentiate it from the Tri-Slosher."
