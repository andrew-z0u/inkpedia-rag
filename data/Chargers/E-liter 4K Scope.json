Besides this, all other stats are the same as the E-liter 4K, and it shares its sub and special weapons.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Splatoon 2\n\n2.1 Data\n2.2 Differences from the E-liter 3K Scope\n2.3 Version history\n2.4 Quotes\n2.5 Gallery\n2.6 Demonstration\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Differences from the E-liter 3K Scope\n\n- 2.3 Version history\n\n- 2.4 Quotes\n\n- 2.5 Gallery\n\n- 2.6 Demonstration\n\n- 3 Splatoon 3\n\n3.1 Data\n3.2 Version history\n3.3 Quotes\n3.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n3.5 Gallery\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 3.5 Gallery\n\n- 4 Strategy\n\n- 5 Trivia\n\n- 6 Names in other languages\n\n- 7 References\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Differences from the E-liter 3K Scope\n\n- 2.3 Version history\n\n- 2.4 Quotes\n\n- 2.5 Gallery\n\n- 2.6 Demonstration\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 3.5 Gallery\n\nThe E-liter 4K Scope is nearly identical in appearance to the E-liter 4K.
