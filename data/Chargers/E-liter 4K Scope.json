    "The E-liter 4K Scope is a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3, and a successor to Splatoon's E-liter 3K Scope.",
    "The E-liter 4K Scope is an E-liter 4K with a scope attached. Compared to the scopeless version it has enhanced range and a zoomed view for greater aiming precision, but players have their field of vision limited by the scope, and it can not store its charge in swim form. Besides this, all other stats are the same as the E-liter 4K, and it shares its sub and special weapons.",
    "The E-liter 4K Scope is nearly identical in appearance to the E-liter 4K. The only difference between the two is that the E-liter 4K Scope has a scope attached to the gas pump handle and the back end of the barrel.",
    "The E-liter 4K Scope comes with Ink Mines and Ink Storm.",
    "It appears in three Octo Expansion stations:",

    "The E-liter 4K Scope delivers the long-range action of the 4K model with a scope for added accuracy! Though it boasts a shot range that beats almost every other charger, you'll want to be extra aware of your surroundings when scoping in. Also, the scoped configuration won't let you store a charged shot, so keep that in mind as you adjust to the feel of using a scope. Like the standard 4K, you'll get Ink Mines and the Ink Storm to help cover the battlefield while you zoom in and splat unsuspecting foes!",
    "The E-liter 4K Scope returns in Splatoon 3 with a new design. It comes with Ink Mine and Wave Breaker, matching the E-liter 4K.",
    "It appears in one mission in Return of the Mammalians:",
