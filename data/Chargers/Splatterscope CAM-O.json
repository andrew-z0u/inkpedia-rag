But with the Sprinkler sub and Crab Tank special, the loadout is still a powerhouse. Give it a try if you want to see how far a scope can take you!\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- Promotional image of the Splatlands Collection - Barazushi weapons\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Splatterscope_CAM-O_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nPromotional video (link to file)\n\n- The original tweet announcing this weapon accidentally used the Japanese suffix \"FRST\" to refer to  Splat Charger CAM-O instead of the localized \"CAM-O\".\n\n- The Splatterscope CAM-O's appearance could be a reference to the Kelp Splatterscope, given the kelp stuck to the side of the ink tank.\n\nThe brand stylization suffix \"CAM-O\" could be interpreted as camo or camouflage."
