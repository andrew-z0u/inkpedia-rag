    "The Fresh Squiffer is a main weapon in Splatoon and Splatoon 2. It is a Classic Squiffer with a different loadout and a dusty red appearance instead of the normal blue.",
    "The Fresh Squiffer shares its overall design with the Classic Squiffer. However, the part that usually connects the bottle to the trigger is red on the Fresh Squiffer, and the sticker on the bottle is pink and green. Interestingly, the starburst sticker present on the New Squiffer is also seen on the Fresh Squiffer.",
    "The Fresh Squiffer was first announced during the Nintendo Direct on 3 March 2016. It is one of eight weapons included in Sheldon's Picks Vol. 1 and was released at  02:00 UTC on 13 April 2016.[1] It comes in a set with Suction Bombs and Kraken.",

    "The new and improved Fresh Squiffer is a Classic Squiffer retooled to allow a different approach. If your foes are laying low, Suction Bombs will let you easily smoke them out from wherever they're cowering. But if they're going on the offensive instead, no need to worry! Turn the tables on them with the Kraken! This is definitely not a set for squids who are afraid to get their tentacles dirty!(NA)",

    "The Fresh Squiffer is a retooled version of its Classic Squiffer cousin with an eye for introducing a squiffy new way to play! Use the Suction Bombs to flush out finnicky foes, then clean them up with the patented Squiffer spray! For those who refuse to come out and play, flip on your Inkjet special and rain on their parade from the skies! If you're someone with an aggressive streak who lives the spicy life on the front lines, this set may just be for you!",
