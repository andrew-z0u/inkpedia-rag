    "The Splatterscope is a main weapon in the Splatoon series.",
    "The Splatterscope is a Splat Charger with a scope attached. Compared to the scopeless version, it has enhanced range and a zoomed view for greater aiming precision, but players have their field of vision limited by the scope, and it can not store its charge in swim form. Besides all of this, all other stats are the same as the Splat Charger, and it shares its sub and special weapons.",
    "The Splatterscope is nearly identical in appearance to the Splat Charger. The only difference between the two is that the Splatterscope has a scope attached to the back end of the barrel.",
    "The Splatterscope comes with Splat Bombs and the Bomb Rush.",

    "- As of Fresh Season 2023, the Splatterscope is the only weapon (besides the Splat Charger) to receive only new variants, with its old variants not returning.",
    "- The 2D icon for the Splatterscope displays the scope portion as being yellow, when normally it changes color to match the player's ink.\nUnlike other weapons whose 2D icon colors are inconsistent with their in-game appearance, such as Dread Wringer, the coloring of the scope is not present in the 3D version of its icon."
