  "content": "The Goo Tuber is a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3. It is a charger with a few unique properties - it can hold a charge for an exceptionally long time in comparison to other chargers, allowing greater versatility, has the ability to store incomplete charges, and is able to splat opponents with a single partially charged shot (dealing over 100 points of damage at roughly 70% charge).\n\nThe ink consumption of the Goo Tuber is better than average, though not exceptional. To compensate for its strengths, the Goo Tuber's charge speed and range are close to the lowest in the weapon class.\n\nWith this weapon, the player can come out of ink and fire faster while having a stored charge. Using this property, they can press  repeatedly while storing a charge to \"roll\" across the ground, which will allow quicker movement than other chargers while keeping a stored charge. This technique is similar to sub strafing and weapon strafing.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Splatoon 2\n\n2.1 Data\n2.2 Version history\n2.3 Quotes\n2.4 Gallery\n2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3 Splatoon 3\n\n3.1 Data\n3.2 Version history\n3.3 Quotes\n3.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n3.5 Gallery\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 3.5 Gallery\n\n- 4 Strategy\n\n- 5 Trivia\n\n- 6 Etymology\n\n6.1 Names in other languages\n6.2 Translation notes\n\n- 6.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 6.2 Translation notes\n\n- 7 References\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 3.5 Gallery\n\n- 6.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 6.2 Translation notes\n\nThe main part of the Goo Tuber is the long white tube that wraps around itself multiple times to connect the pump to the nozzle. The Goo Tuber, unlike other chargers, is not exceptionally long. At the back end of the Goo Tuber is a red pump, and at the front end is a black nozzle. The trigger is black and attached a few inches forward from the pump.\n\nThe Goo Tuber comes with Suction Bombs and Splashdown.\n\nIt appears in one Octo Expansion station:\n\n- G08 Freakazoid Station\n\nEver since the change made to the Goo Tuber in version 2.2.0, its minimal damage for a non-charged shot is 40.0 at 8 frames, and the theoretical damage for a 99.9% charged shot is 130.0 at 74.9 frames. However, due to the game operating in complete frames, it is impossible to have a partial charge at any more than 74 frames, or 98.51% (66 effective charging frames out of a possible 67). This also means that the minimum charge time for a one-shot splat is 53 frames (45 charging frames out of a possible 67), for a 67.16% charge dealing 100.4 damage. With three mains of Main Power Up, the Goo Tuber can reduce the amount it needs to charge to splat to just over half charge.\n\n- The Goo Tuber is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 210. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- Ink consumption scales from 2% to 15% depending on the charge level.\nThe full-charge ink consumption of 15% allows players to fire 6 shots before needing to refill the ink supply.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- The full-charge ink consumption of 15% allows players to fire 6 shots before needing to refill the ink supply.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- The Goo Tuber can store its charge while submerged in ink.\nA stored charge can be held for up to 5 seconds.\nThe Goo Tuber can store incomplete charges.\n\n- A stored charge can be held for up to 5 seconds.\n\n- The Goo Tuber can store incomplete charges.\n\n- The delay between being submerged in ink with a stored charge and being able to fire the charge is 15 frames.\nThe delay between being submerged in ink with a stored charge and the laser appearing is 10 frames.\n\n- The delay between being submerged in ink with a stored charge and the laser appearing is 10 frames.\n\n- It takes 1.25 seconds to fully charge the weapon.\nIt takes 0.88 seconds to reach 100 damage.

It offers high-pressure ink storage for extended periods, allowing you to stay submerged while you wait for the perfect shot! In exchange, it takes a bit longer to charge, but this baby can store a partial charge, giving you the ultimate in flexibility. For instance, while you use a Torpedo to reveal enemy positions, you can be comfortably charging away in a safe spot. Then, when you're ready to ink 'em up, zip to the most advantageous spot and snipe away! If you miss, you have Tenta Missiles in your back pocket to finish the job. If you want to take your strategy to the next level by storing charges and taking advantage of each stage's unique terrain with your mobility, this set is for you!\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- Tableturf Battle card art\n\n- The Goo Tuber's charge display after version 4.1.0\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Goo_Tuber_charge_10.0.0.mp4\n\n\nThe Goo Tuber's charge animation since 10.0.0 (link to file)\n\nFor competitive tips about the Goo Tuber\n\n- The Goo Tuber's design is based on a siphon pump, a red pump that is mainly popular in Japan.\n\n- The Goo Tuber is the only charger since Splatoon that can deal enough damage to splat a player with a partial charge.\n\n- After the version 4.1.0 update in Splatoon 3, the Goo Tuber is technically the first charger to have two levels of charge.\n\n- The Goo Tuber has never had a repeated sub weapon across any of its kits.\nWhen considering weapons that have been available across multiple games, this trait is shared only with the Ballpoint Splatling.\n\n- When considering weapons that have been available across multiple games, this trait is shared only with the Ballpoint Splatling.\n\n- Since 10.0.0 of Splatoon 3, the Goo Tuber's loading animation is quite inconsistent, with the ink not animating in the \"pipes\" correctly and even passing into other parts of the weapon.\n\n- When considering weapons that have been available across multiple games, this trait is shared only with the Ballpoint Splatling.\n\n- Goo Tuber's Japanese name is \"Soy Tuber\".
