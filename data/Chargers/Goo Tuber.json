    "The Goo Tuber is a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3. It is a charger with a few unique properties - it can hold a charge for an exceptionally long time in comparison to other chargers, allowing greater versatility, has the ability to store incomplete charges, and is able to splat opponents with a single partially charged shot (dealing over 100 points of damage at roughly 70% charge).",
    "The ink consumption of the Goo Tuber is better than average, though not exceptional. To compensate for its strengths, the Goo Tuber's charge speed and range are close to the lowest in the weapon class.",
    "With this weapon, the player can come out of ink and fire faster while having a stored charge. Using this property, they can press  repeatedly while storing a charge to \"roll\" across the ground, which will allow quicker movement than other chargers while keeping a stored charge. This technique is similar to sub strafing and weapon strafing.",
    "The main part of the Goo Tuber is the long white tube that wraps around itself multiple times to connect the pump to the nozzle. The Goo Tuber, unlike other chargers, is not exceptionally long. At the back end of the Goo Tuber is a red pump, and at the front end is a black nozzle. The trigger is black and attached a few inches forward from the pump.",
    "The Goo Tuber comes with Suction Bombs and Splashdown.",
    "It appears in one Octo Expansion station:",

    "Ever since the change made to the Goo Tuber in version 2.2.0, its minimal damage for a non-charged shot is 40.0 at 8 frames, and the theoretical damage for a 99.9% charged shot is 130.0 at 74.9 frames. However, due to the game operating in complete frames, it is impossible to have a partial charge at any more than 74 frames, or 98.51% (66 effective charging frames out of a possible 67). This also means that the minimum charge time for a one-shot splat is 53 frames (45 charging frames out of a possible 67), for a 67.16% charge dealing 100.4 damage. With three mains of Main Power Up, the Goo Tuber can reduce the amount it needs to charge to splat to just over half charge.",

    "As of Drizzle Season 2023, this weapon has a second charge ring that appears after the charge has hit 100 damage, similar to a splatling.",

    "For competitive tips about the Goo Tuber",
    "- The Goo Tuber's design is based on a siphon pump, a red pump that is mainly popular in Japan.",
    "- The Goo Tuber is the only charger since Splatoon that can deal enough damage to splat a player with a partial charge.",
    "- After the version 4.1.0 update in Splatoon 3, the Goo Tuber is technically the first charger to have two levels of charge.",
    "- The Goo Tuber has never had a repeated sub weapon across any of its kits.\nWhen considering weapons that have been available across multiple games, this trait is shared only with the Ballpoint Splatling.",
    "- Since 10.0.0 of Splatoon 3, the Goo Tuber's loading animation is quite inconsistent, with the ink not animating in the \"pipes\" correctly and even passing into other parts of the weapon.",
    "- Goo Tuber's Japanese name is \"Soy Tuber\". This weapon resembles a siphon pump aka shōyu pump (醤油ちゅるちゅる Shōyu Churu-churu)."
