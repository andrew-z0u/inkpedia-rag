The main part of the gun is black with lime-green highlights, resembles early AR-15 designs, and has a big suppressor and a paintball hopper as the ink tank.\n\nThe Hero Charger used by Agent 4 has an identical overall design to the Splat Charger from Splatoon 2, with the ink tank being replaced by a paintball hopper and the gun being recolored to match other hero weapons.\n\nAgent 3's Hero Charger behaves similarly to the Splat Charger, with great range, accuracy and damage. It cannot be upgraded with Power Eggs like the Hero Shot can be, and unlike the Hero Shot, it only comes with Splat Bombs. It is exclusively used by the player during the Inkling Girl amiibo challenges, and completing them all unlocks the Hero Charger Replica for purchase at Ammo Knights.\n\n- The Hero Charger is a  weapon.\n\n- Ink consumption scales from 1.6% to 12% depending on the charge level.\nThe full-charge ink consumption of 12% allows players to fire 8 shots before needing to refill the ink supply.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- The full-charge ink consumption of 12% allows players to fire 8 shots before needing to refill the ink supply.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- The Hero Charger cannot store its charge.\n\n- It takes 1 second to fully charge the weapon.\nIt takes 0.57 seconds to reach 100 damage.

It comes equipped with switchable sub weapons of Splat Bombs, Curling Bombs and Autobombs, like every other Hero weapon. It is loaned by Sheldon during the level Octozeppelin Invasion, and can be used in all other missions after beating the level. Completing all the missions in Octo Canyon with the Hero Charger unlocks the Hero Charger Replica for purchase at Ammo Knights.\n\nIn Octo Canyon's final mission Bomb Rush Blush, a cutscene occurs between phases 3 and 4 where Marie uses a Hero Charger (identical in appearance to the one used by Agent 3) to shoot \"low-tide ink\" to knock Callie's Hypnoshades away, curing her out of Octavio's brainwashing.\n\nWhile Hero Charger does not appear as a usable main weapon, Agent 4's Hero Charger appears in a banner in Splatoon 3.\n\nThe Hero Charger Replica is a reward in Splatoon and Splatoon 2 unlocked through various means. It is a charger-type main weapon that is visually identical to the Hero Charger from their respective games, but share the same stats, sub weapon, and special weapon as the Splat Charger from their respective games.\n\n- Agent 3 using the Hero Charger in the Inkling Girl amiibo missions.\n\n- Blueprints collected from bosses with amiibo\n\n- Promotional art of Marie with a Hero Charger for the Show No Mercy! vs. Focus on Healing Splatfest\n\n- Hero Charger Lv. 1\n\n- Hero Charger Lv. 2\n\n- Marie preparing to shoot Callie's Hypnoshades in Bomb Rush Blush"
