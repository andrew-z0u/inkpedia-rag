    "Hero Charger refers to chargers used by player characters Agent 3 and Agent 4 in single-player modes as well as Marie.",
    "The Hero Charger used by Agent 3 and Marie has a futuristic design with a black and lime-green color scheme shared with all hero weapons, and many blue lights that leave a small trail as Agent 3 moves. The main part of the gun is black with lime-green highlights, resembles early AR-15 designs, and has a big suppressor and a paintball hopper as the ink tank.",
    "The Hero Charger used by Agent 4 has an identical overall design to the Splat Charger from Splatoon 2, with the ink tank being replaced by a paintball hopper and the gun being recolored to match other hero weapons.",
    "Agent 3's Hero Charger behaves similarly to the Splat Charger, with great range, accuracy and damage. It cannot be upgraded with Power Eggs like the Hero Shot can be, and unlike the Hero Shot, it only comes with Splat Bombs. It is exclusively used by the player during the Inkling Girl amiibo challenges, and completing them all unlocks the Hero Charger Replica for purchase at Ammo Knights.",
    "[1]",
    "A promotional artwork for Marie's team in Show No Mercy! vs. Focus on Healing Splatfest depicts a Hero Charger inside a semi-opened case near Marie.",
    "Agent 4's Hero Charger is usable in Octo Canyon's base campaign (without the need of amiibo, unlike in Splatoon) and can be upgraded one level. It comes equipped with switchable sub weapons of Splat Bombs, Curling Bombs and Autobombs, like every other Hero weapon. It is loaned by Sheldon during the level Octozeppelin Invasion, and can be used in all other missions after beating the level. Completing all the missions in Octo Canyon with the Hero Charger unlocks the Hero Charger Replica for purchase at Ammo Knights.",
    "In Octo Canyon's final mission Bomb Rush Blush, a cutscene occurs between phases 3 and 4 where Marie uses a Hero Charger (identical in appearance to the one used by Agent 3) to shoot \"low-tide ink\" to knock Callie's Hypnoshades away, curing her out of Octavio's brainwashing.",
    "While Hero Charger does not appear as a usable main weapon, Agent 4's Hero Charger appears in a banner in Splatoon 3.",
    "The Hero Charger Replica is a reward in Splatoon and Splatoon 2 unlocked through various means. It is a charger-type main weapon that is visually identical to the Hero Charger from their respective games, but share the same stats, sub weapon, and special weapon as the Splat Charger from their respective games.",
