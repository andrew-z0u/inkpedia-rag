The 5B is made from softer material than the 5H, making it even easier to learn. Throw out a Splash Wall for cover while you're charging up or unloading a full charge — or use it to distract from your Ink Storm special. With the capacity for five shots on a full charge, the Snipewriter 5B makes a great first charger, because there's not so much pressure on aiming one powerful shot perfectly. Of course, with the luxury of hiding out behind that Splash Wall, maybe you CAN aim perfectly!

A 5B-graded pencil is made of extremely soft graphite and marks in black. It is also likely short for \"5 bullets\" in a similar vein to the Snipewriter 5H's \"5 hits\" referencing the number of shots on one full charge."
