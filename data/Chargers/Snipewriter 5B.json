    "The Snipewriter 5B is a main weapon in Splatoon 3. It is the Nouveau-branded variant of the Snipewriter 5H.",
    "The Snipewriter 5B is similar in design to the Snipewriter 5H. Notable differences are that the drawing compass is red instead of blue and the presence of a sticker of the Nouveau logo placed near the tip of the pencil.",
    "The Snipewriter 5B was first revealed through social media networks on 17 November 2023, and was released on 1 December 2023 as part of the Chill Season 2023 update. Its kit features Splash Wall as the sub weapon and Ink Storm as the special weapon.",

    "- The Snipewriter 5B is the only Nouveau-branded variant to not follow the naming scheme of appending Nouveau after the weapon name.",
    "- When the Snipewriter 5B was revealed on social media, Nintendo's SplatoonNA Twitter account erroneously mistranslated SplatoonJP's previous tweet and stated that the weapon's kit would have the Splattercolor Screen special weapon as a sub weapon, rather than Splash Wall.[3]",
    "Similar to the Snipewriter 5H, the 5B in the name of the Snipewriter 5B is based on the pencil grading of the same name. A 5B-graded pencil is made of extremely soft graphite and marks in black. It is also likely short for \"5 bullets\" in a similar vein to the Snipewriter 5H's \"5 hits\" referencing the number of shots on one full charge."
