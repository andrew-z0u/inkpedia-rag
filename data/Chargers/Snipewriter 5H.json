    "The Snipewriter 5H is a main weapon in Splatoon 3, created by the weapon brand Nouveau. It is a charger with the unique property of, when fully charged, loading five low-damage rounds that it can fire consecutively.",
    "It was revealed in the Chill Season 2022 trailer on 14 November 2022 and was released on 1 December 2022.",
    "The Snipewriter 5H is designed to look like an eraser pencil held in a drawing compass. A window cut into its side facing the user shows its internals are shaped like the points of a stacking-point pencil. There is also a rack above the grip that shows the ink rounds to be loaded into the barrel; as charged shots are fired, these rounds can be seen individually disappearing.",
    "When  is held, five charges of hardened ink are stored, which can be released in rapid succession by releasing and re-pressing  for each charge. Each shot's power is low and leaves it unable to splat with a single fully charged shot; it also lacks piercing ability. Its range is comparable to that of the Splatterscope, meaning it shares its spot with the Splatterscope as the third highest range of any charger in the game, just behind the E-liter 4K and E-liter 4K Scope.",
    "It charges at about the same speed as the Splat Charger, and it fires thin trails of ink, similar to the Bamboozler. It also does not have a charge hold, and any remaining rounds held when changing to swim form are lost (but the player will regain the equivalent amount of ink).",
    "The Snipewriter 5H has a Sprinkler and the Tacticooler for its set. It was added along with Chill Season 2022 on 1 December 2022.",

    "- The Snipewriter 5H is not included in Return of the Mammalians due to it being added post-release.",
    "- The Snipewriter 5H is the only charger that can splat a Drizzler on a single charge before it ducks back beneath its armor.",
    "- The Snipewriter 5H is one of the few weapons for which it is not apparent by its name that it is the first kit released for that weapon. Some other weapons that share this distinction are the Classic Squiffer, Dark Tetra Dualies, Nautilus 47, and the Mint Decavitator.",
    "Snipewrite is a portmanteau composed of snipe (as in \"sniper\") and writer (referring to the pencil). It is also a pun on the word \"typewriter\".",
    "5H refers to the pencil grading of the same name, signifying a very hard graphite, and also is likely short for \"5 hits\", the maximum number of shots in one full charge."
