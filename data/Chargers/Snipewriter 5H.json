    "The Snipewriter 5H is a main weapon in Splatoon 3, created by the weapon brand Nouveau. It is a charger with the unique property of, when fully charged, loading five low-damage rounds that it can fire consecutively.",
    "It was revealed in the Chill Season 2022 trailer on 14 November 2022 and was released on 1 December 2022.",
    "The Snipewriter 5H is designed to look like an eraser pencil held in a drawing compass. A window cut into its side facing the user shows its internals are shaped like the points of a stacking-point pencil. There is also a rack above the grip that shows the ink rounds to be loaded into the barrel; as charged shots are fired, these rounds can be seen individually disappearing.",
    "When  is held, five charges of hardened ink are stored, which can be released in rapid succession by releasing and re-pressing  for each charge. Each shot's power is low and leaves it unable to splat with a single fully charged shot; it also lacks piercing ability. Its range is comparable to that of the Splatterscope, meaning it shares its spot with the Splatterscope as the third highest range of any charger in the game, just behind the E-liter 4K and E-liter 4K Scope.",
    "It charges at about the same speed as the Splat Charger, and it fires thin trails of ink, similar to the Bamboozler. It also does not have a charge hold, and any remaining rounds held when changing to swim form are lost (but the player will regain the equivalent amount of ink).",
    "The Snipewriter 5H has a Sprinkler and the Tacticooler for its set. It was added along with Chill Season 2022 on 1 December 2022.",
    "[1][2]",
    "Salmon Run Next Wave:",
    "If you use chargers but wish they were a little more...prolific...enter the Snipewriter 5H! It's a charger-style weapon that can fire shots in quick succession. Hold down  to charge, and then release to fire. Then you can press  to fire again and again—up to five shots on a single charge! Now, there's always a catch, and here's the catch on this weapon—each shot is a bit less powerful than some other chargers, and you can't store a charge. But when you have the Sprinkler to help with coverage and a Tacticooler to power up your friends, those may be catches you can live with.",
    "For competitive tips about the Snipewriter 5H",
    "Snipewrite is a portmanteau composed of snipe (as in \"sniper\") and writer (referring to the pencil). It is also a pun on the word \"typewriter\".",
    "5H refers to the pencil grading of the same name, signifying a very hard graphite, and also is likely short for \"5 hits\", the maximum number of shots in one full charge.",
