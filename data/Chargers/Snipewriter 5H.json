  "content": "The Snipewriter 5H is a main weapon in Splatoon 3, created by the weapon brand Nouveau. It is a charger with the unique property of, when fully charged, loading five low-damage rounds that it can fire consecutively.\n\nIt was revealed in the Chill Season 2022 trailer on 14 November 2022 and was released on 1 December 2022.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Description\n\n- 3 Splatoon 3\n\n3.1 Data\n3.2 Version history\n3.3 Quotes\n3.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n3.5 Gallery\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 3.5 Gallery\n\n- 4 Strategy\n\n- 5 Trivia\n\n- 6 Etymology\n\n6.1 Names in other languages\n6.2 Translation notes\n\n- 6.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 6.2 Translation notes\n\n- 7 References\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 3.5 Gallery\n\n- 6.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 6.2 Translation notes\n\nThe Snipewriter 5H is designed to look like an eraser pencil held in a drawing compass. A window cut into its side facing the user shows its internals are shaped like the points of a stacking-point pencil. There is also a rack above the grip that shows the ink rounds to be loaded into the barrel; as charged shots are fired, these rounds can be seen individually disappearing.\n\nWhen  is held, five charges of hardened ink are stored, which can be released in rapid succession by releasing and re-pressing  for each charge. Each shot's power is low and leaves it unable to splat with a single fully charged shot; it also lacks piercing ability. Its range is comparable to that of the Splatterscope, meaning it shares its spot with the Splatterscope as the third highest range of any charger in the game, just behind the E-liter 4K and E-liter 4K Scope.\n\nIt charges at about the same speed as the Splat Charger, and it fires thin trails of ink, similar to the Bamboozler. It also does not have a charge hold, and any remaining rounds held when changing to swim form are lost (but the player will regain the equivalent amount of ink).\n\nThe Snipewriter 5H has a Sprinkler and the Tacticooler for its set. It was added along with Chill Season 2022 on 1 December 2022.\n\n- The Snipewriter 5H is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 25. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- Ink consumption scales from 1.97% to 35% depending on the charge level.\nThe full-charge ink consumption of 35% allows players to fully charge 2 times before running out of ink.\n\n- The full-charge ink consumption of 35% allows players to fully charge 2 times before running out of ink.\n\n- The Snipewriter 5H cannot store its charge.\n\n- Fully charging the weapon allows it to fire 5 times before needing to recharge.\n\n- When fully charged, the weapon can fire every 17 frames.\n\n- It takes 1.2 seconds to fully charge the weapon (72 frames).\nWhen charging a shot with an empty tank, the charge rate is 33.33%, permitting the player to fully charge a shot in 3.6 seconds.\nWhen charging a shot while in the air, the charge rate is 33.33%, permitting the player to fully charge a shot in 3.6 seconds.\nThe weapon must charge for at least 8 frames before it can release its charge.\n\n- When charging a shot with an empty tank, the charge rate is 33.33%, permitting the player to fully charge a shot in 3.6 seconds.\n\n- When charging a shot while in the air, the charge rate is 33.33%, permitting the player to fully charge a shot in 3.6 seconds.\n\n- The weapon must charge for at least 8 frames before it can release its charge.\n\n- The full-charge ink consumption of 35% allows players to fully charge 2 times before running out of ink.\n\n- When charging a shot with an empty tank, the charge rate is 33.33%, permitting the player to fully charge a shot in 3.6 seconds.\n\n- When charging a shot while in the air, the charge rate is 33.33%, permitting the player to fully charge a shot in 3.6 seconds.\n\n- The weapon must charge for at least 8 frames before it can release its charge.\n\n- The interval between firing and being able to submerge in ink is 15 frames.\n\n- Fully charged shots will not pierce opponents.\n\n- When charging while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.068 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 20 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Damage scales from 40 to 68 depending on the charge level.\n\n- Shot distance scales from 10.76 units to 25.77 units depending on the charge level. At full charge, the distance is 27.77 units.\nThe range of charger weapons is impacted by the position of the weapon's muzzle in its model file.

It's a charger-style weapon that can fire shots in quick succession. Hold down  to charge, and then release to fire. Then you can press  to fire again and again—up to five shots on a single charge! Now, there's always a catch, and here's the catch on this weapon—each shot is a bit less powerful than some other chargers, and you can't store a charge. But when you have the Sprinkler to help with coverage and a Tacticooler to power up your friends, those may be catches you can live with.\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- An Octoling holding the Snipewriter 5H.\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Snipewriter 5H.\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Snipewriter_5H_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nPromotional video (link to file)\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Snipewriter_5H_firing.mp4\n\n\nClose-up view of the Snipewriter 5H charging and firing; the rounds in the tray can be seen being loaded and depleting.

Some other weapons that share this distinction are the Classic Squiffer, Dark Tetra Dualies, Nautilus 47, and the Mint Decavitator.\n\nSnipewrite is a portmanteau composed of snipe (as in \"sniper\") and writer (referring to the pencil). It is also a pun on the word \"typewriter\".\n\n5H refers to the pencil grading of the same name, signifying a very hard graphite, and also is likely short for \"5 hits\", the maximum number of shots in one full charge."
