The weapon's charge speed is almost instantaneous and the damage it deals is higher than the Bamboozler but is still lower than other chargers; it is unable to burst a Steelhead's bomb in one shot. Movement speed while charging is 20% higher than that of the Bamboozler. Its ink consumption is between the Goo Tuber's and the Splat Charger's, consuming 13% of the player's ink tank per shot.\n\nThe Grizzco Charger is similar in appearance to the Bamboozler 14 Mk I. However, the Grizzco Charger is colored dark brown, reinforced by some metal parts, and has four yellow pill bottles with white caps sticking out of the main body. It is also modified to resemble a bicycle pump: the bamboo handle is replaced by a black metal one, the front sight is replaced by an iron rectangular frame pump base, and there is a black pump base under the muzzle, coming out of which are a metal tube bearing the Grizzco logo and a red hose that hangs near the handle.\n\nThe Grizzco Charger is a rare weapon only available during Salmon Run wildcard rotations.
