    "The E-liter 4K is a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3, a successor to Splatoon's E-liter 3K. It is a charger-type weapon that sacrifices mobility, ink consumption and charge time for extreme range that is only outclassed by its scoped variant.",
    "Like most chargers, this weapon can store a fully charged shot in swim form for a short amount of time, and a fully charged shot will pierce through opponents.",
    "In general, the E-liter 4K is based on a plastic gas pump handle with a metallic ink tank on the back and an elongated metallic spout with a plastic attachment and a black sight which acts as the barrel.",
    "In Splatoon 2, the plastic parts are yellow and the ink tank changes color to match the user's ink.",
    "In Splatoon 3, the plastic parts are blue, the handle also has a seven-segment LCD display, and the tube connecting the handle to the ink tank and a spring on the barrel change color to match the user's ink.",
    "The E-liter 4K comes with Ink Mines and Ink Storm. It can store a charge for one second.",
    "It appears in four Octo Expansion stations:",
    "[1]",
    "With its pressurized polymer construction, the E-liter 4K has a remarkably long range, even for a charger! This model offers a more compact design than the original, which has cut into its range slightly, but it still has plenty of reach! Use the accompanying Ink Mines to cover your tracks, and then bring the Ink Storm special to expose anyone who dares hide from you!",
    "The E-liter 4K returns in Splatoon 3 with a new design and comes with Ink Mines and the Wave Breaker.",
    "It appears in two missions in Return of the Mammalians:",
    "[2][3]",
    "With its pressurized polymer construction, the E-liter 4K has a remarkably long range, even for a charger! To get the most out of it, you can set Ink Mines for opponents who get too close, then use the Wave Breaker special to reveal those who are slinking around in the ink. Still, this set is all about long-range accuracy, and in the right hands, it will definitely hit the target. I hope it goes to a good home!",
    "E-liter is a pun on elite and liter (the metric unit of volume by which gasoline is sold in many countries). The 4K in the name refers to the number of fully charged shots the weapon can fire before running out of ink, which is four.",
