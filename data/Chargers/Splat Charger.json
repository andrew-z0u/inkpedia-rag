  "content": "The Splat Charger is a main weapon in the Splatoon series.\n\nThe Splat Charger, like other charger-type weapons, can be charged up before firing. The more it is charged, the farther the ink will go and the more damage it will deal. Only a fully charged shot will splat an enemy in one hit. It also creates a thick line of ink, rather than many small blobs like shooter-class weapons do. This weapon is the most basic form of charger in the Splatoon series, with all-around average performance, and longer range than most weapons (though not the highest in the class). This weapon has a scoped variant.\n\nFrom Splatoon 2 onwards, this weapon can store a fully charged shot in swim form for a short amount of time, and a fully charged shot will pierce through opponents.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Splatoon\n\n2.1 Data\n2.2 Version history\n2.3 Quotes\n2.4 Gallery\n2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3 Splatoon 2\n\n3.1 Data\n3.2 Version history\n3.3 Quotes\n3.4 Gallery\n3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 4 Splatoon 3\n\n4.1 Data\n4.2 Version history\n4.3 Quotes\n4.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n4.5 Gallery\n\n- 4.1 Data\n\n- 4.2 Version history\n\n- 4.3 Quotes\n\n- 4.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 4.5 Gallery\n\n- 5 Strategy\n\n- 6 Trivia\n\n- 7 Names in other languages\n\n- 8 Notes\n\n- 9 References\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 4.1 Data\n\n- 4.2 Version history\n\n- 4.3 Quotes\n\n- 4.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 4.5 Gallery\n\nThe Splat Charger, like many other chargers, has an ink tank at the back and a long barrel with the handle and trigger situated at the back end of the barrel. The ink tank changes color to match the user's ink. In Splatoon, the handle is yellow, the trigger, nozzle, and the back part of the barrel are red, and there is a large, dark green block in the middle of the barrel, leaving the rest of the barrel white. In Splatoon 2, the Splat Charger's appearance is less blocky and more stylized to fit the rest of the game. The barrel is completely white with some empty purple and green scope mounts, the handle is mainly blueish purple, and there is a green sight mounted to the end of the barrel.\n\nIn Splatoon 3, an additional sight is present above the barrel, a pump handle extends behind the trigger, and a blue cap is attached to the back end of the ink tank. The barrel is now completely black, the base is purple, and the trigger, pump, rail and both sights are yellow.\n\nThe Splat Charger comes with Splat Bombs and the Bomb Rush.\n\n- The Splat Charger is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- Ink consumption scales from 2.4% to 18% depending on the charge level.\nThe full-charge ink consumption of 18% allows players to fire 5 shots before needing to refill the ink supply.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- The full-charge ink consumption of 18% allows players to fire 5 shots before needing to refill the ink supply.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- The Splat Charger cannot store its charge.\n\n- It takes 1 second to fully charge the weapon.\nWhen charging a shot with an empty tank, the charge rate is 33.33%, permitting the player to fully charge a shot in 3 seconds.\n\n- When charging a shot with an empty tank, the charge rate is 33.33%, permitting the player to fully charge a shot in 3 seconds.\n\n- Shots cannot pierce through enemies.\n\n- When charging while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.2 units per frame.\n\n- Damage scales from 40 to 100 depending on the charge level.

And with Splat Bombs to flush out hiding enemies and the Ink Vac to turn the tables on invaders, this set is impressively well-balanced.

This is a pattern that holds true across all three games, as none of its historical variants have ever returned in subsequent games besides the unbranded, vanilla variant.\nBecause of this, it is also the weapon with the most distinguished variants across the series: if the repeat kits within the same game do not count separately (for example the Order Charger Replica, and the base Splat Charger are counted as one because they both have Splat Bomb and Ink Vac), then the Splat Charger has had 6 variants across the series.\n\n- Because of this, it is also the weapon with the most distinguished variants across the series: if the repeat kits within the same game do not count separately (for example the Order Charger Replica, and the base Splat Charger are counted as one because they both have Splat Bomb and Ink Vac), then the Splat Charger has had 6 variants across the series.\n\n- Across all three games, the Splat Charger has had Splat Bomb as its sub weapon.\n\n- When chargers and the Ink Vac come up on Judd's trials, the player is equipped with the Splat Charger on both occasions.\n\n- Because of this, it is also the weapon with the most distinguished variants across the series: if the repeat kits within the same game do not count separately (for example the Order Charger Replica, and the base Splat Charger are counted as one because they both have Splat Bomb and Ink Vac), then the Splat Charger has had 6 variants across the series."
