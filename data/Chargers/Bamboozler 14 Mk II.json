    "The Bamboozler 14 Mk II is a main weapon in the Splatoon series. It is a Bamboozler 14 Mk I with the Cuttlegear logo plastered onto it and a different loadout.",
    "The Bamboozler 14 Mk II is nearly identical to the Bamboozler 14 Mk I. The only difference between the two is that the Bamboozler 14 Mk II has a sticker bearing the Cuttlegear logo on the back of the barrel.",
    "In Splatoon 3, the Bamboozler 14 Mk II features a cooler green for the color of the bamboo.",
    "The Bamboozler 14 Mk II was released on 18 November 2015 at 02:00 UTC.[1] It comes in a set with Disruptors and the Echolocator.",
    "[2]",
    "The Bamboozler 14 Mk II has the same stats as the Mk I, but its new look is super snazzy! Use the Echolocator to find enemies, disable them with Disruptor, then finish them off with the Bamboozler! Such terrifying efficiency is only right for a legendary weapon. Use it to relive the Great Turf War days of old!\n(NA)",
    "The Bamboozler 14 Mk II was released on 1 July 2018 at 00:00 UTC.[3] It comes with Toxic Mist and the Burst-Bomb Launcher.",
    "[4]",
    "The Bamboozler 14 Mk II brings back all the function of the original but with a cool new decal the squidkids are sure to love! Like the other 'boozler, it can't store charged shots, but Toxic Mist will let you slow down foes and pick them off! The Burst-Bomb Launcher special let's(sic) you ink a big swath of turf in one go, which is great for keeping opponents in their place. This set does the legendary squad leader proud if you ask me. Get out there and relive the memory of the Great Turf Wars of old!",
    "The Bamboozler 14 Mk II returns in Splatoon 3 as part of Sizzle Season 2024. Its kit consists of Fizzy Bomb and Super Chump. Its design has changed somewhat from past games; the bamboo color is now a much darker, deeper, cooler variant of green, rather than the traditional lighter green of the Mk I. Otherwise, the design remains unchanged, with a Cuttlegear logo on the side of the weapon.",
    "[5][6]",
    "The Bamboozler 14 Mk II brings back all the function of the original but with a cool new decal today's youth are sure to love! Like the other 'boozler, it can't store charged shots, but its Fizzy Bomb commands enemy attention as you pick them off! You can also pick off foes whose hands are full dealing with the Super Chump special! Isn't it so satisfying when your weapons combo like that? This set does the legendary squad leader proud, if you ask me. Get out there, and relive the memory of the Great Turf War of old!",
