    "The E-liter 3K Scope is nearly identical in appearance to the E-liter 3K. However, the E-liter 3K Scope has a dark-blue scope attached to the barrel, along with a black metal sight.",
    "The E-liter 3K Scope was released on 22 July 2015 at 02:00 UTC.[1]",

    "[2]",
    "The E-liter 3K Scope is an E-liter 3K with an added scope for effective long-distance aiming. It's great for hitting far-off targets, but your view is narrow while charging, so careful where you use it!(NA)",
