    "The E-liter 3K Scope (NA), or E-Litre 3K Scope (EU/OC), is a main weapon in Splatoon.",
    "The E-liter 3K Scope is an E-liter 3K with a scope attached. Compared to the scopeless version it has enhanced range and a zoomed view for greater aiming precision, but players have their field of vision limited by the scope. Besides this, all other stats are the same as the E-liter 3K, and it shares its sub and special weapons.",
    "In later installments, this weapon was replaced with an updated version called the E-liter 4K Scope.",
    "The E-liter 3K Scope is nearly identical in appearance to the E-liter 3K. However, the E-liter 3K Scope has a dark-blue scope attached to the barrel, along with a black metal sight.",
    "The E-liter 3K Scope was released on 22 July 2015 at 02:00 UTC.[1]",
    "It comes with the same set as the un-scoped E-liter 3K, Burst Bombs and the Echolocator.",
