Compared to the scopeless version it has enhanced range and a zoomed view for greater aiming precision, but players have their field of vision limited by the scope. Besides this, all other stats are the same as the E-liter 3K, and it shares its sub and special weapons.\n\nIn later installments, this weapon was replaced with an updated version called the E-liter 4K Scope.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Splatoon\n\n2.1 Data\n2.2 Version history\n2.3 Quotes\n2.4 Gallery\n2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3 Trivia\n\n- 4 Names in other languages\n\n- 5 Notes\n\n- 6 References\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\nThe E-liter 3K Scope is nearly identical in appearance to the E-liter 3K.
