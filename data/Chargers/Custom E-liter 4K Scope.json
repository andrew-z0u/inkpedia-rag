    "The Custom E-liter 4K Scope is a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3. It is the scoped version of the Custom E-liter 4K.",
    "The Custom E-liter 4K Scope is nearly identical in appearance to the Custom E-liter 4K. The only difference between the two is that the Custom E-liter 4K Scope has a scope attached to the back end of the barrel.",
    "The Custom E-liter 4K Scope was released on 14 October 2017 at 02:00 UTC.[1] It comes with Squid Beakons and the Bubble Blower.",
    "[2]",
    "The Custom E-liter 4K Scope gives you everything you loved about the Custom 4K with the added ability to zoom in on distant opponents! A word of warning though: you'll be trading unparalleled shot range and accuracy for a limited view and the inability to store a charged shot! Just like with the Custom 4K, you've got Squid Beakons and the Bubble Blower, so rally your allies and support them from a distance!",
    "The Custom E-liter 4K Scope returns in Splatoon 3 with a new design. It comes with Squid Beakons and Kraken Royale, which matches the Custom E-liter 4K. It was added in the Fresh Season 2024 update. The weapon's plastic grips and supports are now red instead of blue, unlike the original E-liter 4K Scope.",
    "[3][4]",
    "The Custom E-liter 4K Scope gives you everything you loved about the Custom E-liter 4K with the added ability to zoom in on distant opponents! While it boasts the longest range of any charger, be extra aware that you have a reduced field of vision while charging and you won't be able to store your charge. Find a safe spot to establish a Squid Beakon for your allies, then give your enemies a surprise with the Kraken Royale! There's no better charger for those with the skill!",
