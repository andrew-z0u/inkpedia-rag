  "content": "The Custom Goo Tuber is a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3. It is a Custom-branded version of the Goo Tuber.\n\nThis weapon can hold a charge for an exceptionally long time in comparison to other chargers, being able to hold a charge for five seconds as opposed to other chargers which only last one second. This allows players to get to a better vantage point or sneak up on enemies with a full charge. The weapon also bears the ability to store incomplete charges. Its charging time takes slightly longer than a Splat Charger, and the range is slightly shorter. Each fully charged shot consumes 15% of the ink tank, allowing users to fire six shots before needing to refill.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Splatoon 2\n\n2.1 Data\n2.2 Version history\n2.3 Quotes\n2.4 Gallery\n2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3 Splatoon 3\n\n3.1 Data\n3.2 Version history\n3.3 Quotes\n3.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n3.5 Gallery\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 3.5 Gallery\n\n- 4 Strategy\n\n- 5 Etymology\n\n5.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 5.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 6 References\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 3.5 Gallery\n\n- 5.1 Names in other languages\n\nThe Custom Goo Tuber is nearly identical in appearance to the Goo Tuber.

You've got the Ultra Stamp special in your back pocket! It's so satisfying to turn the tables like that... And remember—stored charges are great, but this weapon still packs a punch on a partial charge. Don't be shy with that trigger button!\n\n- Promotional render\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Custom Goo Tuber.\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Custom_Goo_Tuber_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nModel of the Custom Goo Tuber rotating (Link to file)\n\nFor competitive tips about the Custom Goo Tuber\n\nGoo Tuber's Japanese name is \"Soy Tuber\".
