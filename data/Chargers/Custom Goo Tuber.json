    "The Custom Goo Tuber is a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3. It is a Custom-branded version of the Goo Tuber.",
    "This weapon can hold a charge for an exceptionally long time in comparison to other chargers, being able to hold a charge for five seconds as opposed to other chargers which only last one second. This allows players to get to a better vantage point or sneak up on enemies with a full charge. The weapon also bears the ability to store incomplete charges. Its charging time takes slightly longer than a Splat Charger, and the range is slightly shorter. Each fully charged shot consumes 15% of the ink tank, allowing users to fire six shots before needing to refill.",
    "The Custom Goo Tuber is nearly identical in appearance to the Goo Tuber. The only difference between the two is that the Custom Goo Tuber has a sticker bearing the Custom logo stuck on the pump.",
    "In Splatoon 3, the color of the Custom Goo Tuber's pump has been changed from orange to light blue.",
    "The Custom Goo Tuber was released on 9 February 2018 at 02:00 UTC.[1] It comes with Curling Bombs and the Inkjet.",
