    "The Bamboozler 14 Mk I is a main weapon in the Splatoon series. It is a mobile and very short range charger with the highest charge rate and lowest ink consumption of any weapon in its class. This allows shots to be fired in quick succession, at the cost of having much lower damage than most other chargers, requiring more than one full charge to splat an opponent.",
    "Although this weapon has a very short range for a charger, its range remains constant regardless of its charge. Additionally, to compensate for its fast fire rate, the ink trail it leaves on the ground is very thin. It cannot store a fully charged shot in swim form, and its fully charged shots cannot pierce opponents, qualities most other chargers have starting in Splatoon 2.",
    "The Bamboozler 14 Mk I resembles a simple hand-operated reciprocating pump constructed from bamboo. Both the handle and the entire body of the weapon are colored green. A circular pink cap is connected to the bottom of the muzzle. The front sight and rear sight of the weapon are both black, resembling detachable ironsights used by contemporary firearms, with the rear sight being connected to the body via a black cylinder-like link, while the front sight is triangle-shaped. The inside of the weapon is cream-colored.",
    "The Bamboozler 14 Mk I was released on 29 August 2015 at 02:00 UTC.[1] It comes in a set with Splash Walls and the Killer Wail.",
    "[2]",
    "The Bamboozler 14 Mk I is a modernized working replica of a weapon once used by a legendary commander! Its nostalgic appearance is faithful to the weaponry of the time, but its range and firepower aren't great. However, it charges quickly and is pretty powerful at max range, so set up that Splash Wall and get sniping! Oh, and it also features the powerful Killer Wail! Step into the shoes of the legendary captains with this classic!(NA)",
    "The Bamboozler 14 Mk I returns in Splatoon 2, looking identical to how it did in the first game. It was released on 7 October 2017 at 02:00 UTC[3]. It comes with Curling Bombs and Tenta Missiles.",
    "The Bamboozler 14 Mk I is an exception to the piercing mechanic that other charger-type weapons in Splatoon 2 have. Shots do not pierce through enemies, even if fully charged. Although it cannot store a charge like other chargers, it receives a lighter mid-air charge penalty.",
    "It appears in seven Octo Expansion stations:",
    "[4]",
    "The Bamboozler 14 Mk I is a tribute to a weapon used by the leader of a legendary squid squad, but it's been retooled for the battles of today! I've used bamboo in my version to remain faithful to the original design, but as a trade-off it can't store a charged shot. It lacks the damage of some other chargers, but it has a good rate of fire and provides decent mobility when fully charged! With the included Curling Bombs, you can be effective at any range! When the time's right, you can also unleash the Tenta Missiles!",
    "The Bamboozler 14 MK I returns in Splatoon 3. Its kit is the Autobomb and Killer Wail 5.1.\nIt appears in two missions in Return of the Mammalians:",
    "[5][6]",
    "The Bamboozler 14 Mk I is a tribute to a weapon used by the leader of the famous Squidbeak Splatoon, but retooled for the battles of today! I've used bamboo in my version to remain faithful to the original design, but as a trade-off, it can't store a charged shot. Is it the most powerful charger? No. Is it the most mobile charger? Also no. But with \"good enough\" power and charging speed, I think this is a compromise that WORKS. Plus, when you have Autobombs to sniff out enemy positions, you can put yourself in the perfect spot to charge up and attack! For the coup de grâce, activate your Killer Wail 5.1 and take a moment to pay tribute to the legendary leader who inspired this weapon.",

    "To bamboozle can have two meanings:",
    "By extension, a bamboozler is one who perpetrates any of the aforementioned acts. It is also a pun on the weapon's bamboo (from a different word root) construction.",
    "14 may refer to the number of charged shots that can be sequentially fired with a full tank (Splatoon, earlier versions of Splatoon 2, and Splatoon 3 only), or possibly 2014, the year of Splatoon's initial reveal. \"Mark\" (often abbreviated as \"Mk.\") is a designation system for different versions of products, especially military technology and firearms. The use of Roman numerals for the Bamboozler series of weapons may reference their relative age as a weapon over 100 years old (Roman numerals have largely been retired for these designations in the real world in favor of Arabic numerals).",
