    "The Bamboozler 14 Mk I is a main weapon in the Splatoon series. It is a mobile and very short range charger with the highest charge rate and lowest ink consumption of any weapon in its class. This allows shots to be fired in quick succession, at the cost of having much lower damage than most other chargers, requiring more than one full charge to splat an opponent.",
    "Although this weapon has a very short range for a charger, its range remains constant regardless of its charge. Additionally, to compensate for its fast fire rate, the ink trail it leaves on the ground is very thin. It cannot store a fully charged shot in swim form, and its fully charged shots cannot pierce opponents, qualities most other chargers have starting in Splatoon 2.",
    "The Bamboozler 14 Mk I resembles a simple hand-operated reciprocating pump constructed from bamboo. Both the handle and the entire body of the weapon are colored green. A circular pink cap is connected to the bottom of the muzzle. The front sight and rear sight of the weapon are both black, resembling detachable ironsights used by contemporary firearms, with the rear sight being connected to the body via a black cylinder-like link, while the front sight is triangle-shaped. The inside of the weapon is cream-colored.",
    "The Bamboozler 14 Mk I was released on 29 August 2015 at 02:00 UTC.[1] It comes in a set with Splash Walls and the Killer Wail.",

    "The Bamboozler 14 Mk I is an exception to the piercing mechanic that other charger-type weapons in Splatoon 2 have. Shots do not pierce through enemies, even if fully charged. Although it cannot store a charge like other chargers, it receives a lighter mid-air charge penalty.",

    "- The Bamboozler 14 Mk I is a modernized version of the Bamboozler used in the Great Turf War.",
    "- Cuttlefish uses an old Bamboozler as a cane.",
    "- In Splatoon and Splatoon 3, the Bamboozler 14 family can fire exactly fourteen fully charged shots before the user needs to refill their ink tank.\nSince version 5.3.0 of Splatoon 2, the weapon can only shoot 11 fully charged shots per tank in that game.\nAs of version 2.1.0 of Splatoon 3, the number of shots it can fire per tank is back to 14.",
    "- The Bamboozler has the highest charge rate of any charger in the game, excluding the Grizzco Charger.",
    "- The Bamboozler is the only charger that does not glow when fully charged.",
    "- Until the introduction of the Snipewriter 5H in Chill Season 2022 of Splatoon 3:\nThe Bamboozler was the only un-scoped charger to have the inability to hold a charge.\nThe Bamboozler was the only charger to not have the ability to splat an opponent in one shot with a full charge.",
    "- With a full set of Damage Up in Splatoon, or three mains and four subs of Main Power Up in Splatoon 2, this weapon is able to reach 99.9 damage with only about 5/6 of a charge, or at full charge, respectively. Due to this, if an enemy steps in the player's ink, they can be splatted with only one shot.",
    "- The Tableturf Battle card art for the Bamboozler 14 Mk I is similar to a piece of official art from Splatoon, with both Inklings striking the same pose while half-submerged in ink.",
    "- The Bamboozler appears to be based on a type of children's toy called a bamboo gun.",
    "To bamboozle can have two meanings:",
    "By extension, a bamboozler is one who perpetrates any of the aforementioned acts. It is also a pun on the weapon's bamboo (from a different word root) construction.",
    "14 may refer to the number of charged shots that can be sequentially fired with a full tank (Splatoon, earlier versions of Splatoon 2, and Splatoon 3 only), or possibly 2014, the year of Splatoon's initial reveal. \"Mark\" (often abbreviated as \"Mk.\") is a designation system for different versions of products, especially military technology and firearms. The use of Roman numerals for the Bamboozler series of weapons may reference their relative age as a weapon over 100 years old (Roman numerals have largely been retired for these designations in the real world in favor of Arabic numerals)."
