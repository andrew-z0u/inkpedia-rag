    "The Kensa Charger is a main weapon in Splatoon 2. It is a Toni Kensa-branded variant of the Splat Charger.",
    "The Kensa Charger is a black-and-white Splat Charger with a large Toni Kensa signature red clothespin attached to the body of the weapon. Unlike the Splat Charger and the Firefin Splat Charger, the ink reservoir of the Kensa Charger does not change with the user's ink color and is always black.",
    "The Kensa Charger was released on 14 September 2018 at 02:00 UTC. It comes with Sprinklers and the Baller. It has the ability to store a charge for one second.",
    "- Unlike Damage Up in Splatoon, while Main Power Up increases damage, it does not allow shots below full charge to reach 100.0 damage.",

    "- Promotional render.",
    "- Inkling girl with Kensa Charger and Kensa Splatterscope.",
    "For competitive tips about the Kensa Charger",
    "- Oddly, the English name for this weapon omits specifying the weapon as a Splat Charger, referring to the weapon as the \"Kensa Charger\" as opposed to the \"Kensa Splat Charger\".\nThis may be because the Kensa Charger is the only charger-type weapon (apart from its counterpart the Kensa Splatterscope) in the Kensa Collection, as opposed to the dualie class also having the Kensa Glooga Dualies and the roller class also having the Kensa Dynamo Roller. The specification of this weapon being a \"Splat Charger\" is not necessary, unlike the other Kensa/Splat weapons."
