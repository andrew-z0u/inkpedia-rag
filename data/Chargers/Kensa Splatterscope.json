    "The Kensa Splatterscope is basically a Kensa Splat Charger with a scope attached for long-range sniping! While it's got the same specs as a standard Splatterscope, it comes with a Sprinkler for supporting your teammates. And when the time comes, use the Baller special to flip the script and take the fight directly to the enemy! If you're a scoped charger user who's looking for something new, look no further than this set!",
