Its earthy tones and matte texture help it blend into the background. Here, it comes with the Sprinkler sub, which can be used to lure enemies out of hiding for easy splatting. Add the Crab Tank special, and you've got something, well, special. Overall, the loadout is a tactician's dream. I recommend it to any player who thinks of the battlefield like a chessboard.\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- Promotional image for Version 10.0.0\n\n- Promotional image of the Splatlands Collection - Barazushi weapons\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Splat_Charger_CAM-O_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nPromotional video (link to file)\n\n- The Splat Charger CAM-O's appearance could be a reference to the Kelp Splat Charger, given the kelp stuck to the side of the ink tank.\n\nThe brand stylization suffix \"CAM-O\" could be interpreted as camo or camouflage."
