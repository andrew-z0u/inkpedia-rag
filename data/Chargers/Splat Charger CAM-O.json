    "The Splat Charger CAM-O is a main weapon in the Splatoon series. It is a Barazushi-branded variant of the the Splat Charger from the Splatlands Collection and features a different sub and special weapon.",
    "The Splat Charger CAM-O makes its first appearance in Splatoon 3 with identical stats to the Splat Charger.",
    "[1][2]",
    "If a Splat Charger is a sniper rifle at heart, then the Splat Charger CAM-O from Barazushi is a natural evolution. Its earthy tones and matte texture help it blend into the background. Here, it comes with the Sprinkler sub, which can be used to lure enemies out of hiding for easy splatting. Add the Crab Tank special, and you've got something, well, special. Overall, the loadout is a tactician's dream. I recommend it to any player who thinks of the battlefield like a chessboard.",
    "The brand stylization suffix \"CAM-O\" could be interpreted as camo or camouflage.",
