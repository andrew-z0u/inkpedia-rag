In Splatoon 2, it is identical to the Level 1 Hero Charger.\n\nThe Hero Charger is not available during regular Octo Valley missions but can be used at the amiibo stand in Inkopolis Plaza with an Inkling Girl amiibo. When using this amiibo, the player is given the chance to go through some of the previous Octo Valley levels that they have beaten and replay them using a charger rather than a shooter.\n\nVisually, it is based on the Hero Charger found in Octo Valley, but stats-wise it is identical to the Splat Charger.\n\nWhen the blueprints are obtained and given to Sheldon in Ammo Knights, he gives the player the Hero Charger Replica as he cannot copy the technology shown on the blueprints. It, therefore, loses the specially-designed Agent 3 Splat Bombs.\n\nThe Hero Charger looks slightly similar to the real-life M16 Rifle, an iconic weapon and the standard service rifle for many armies in the world; however, the M16 is an assault rifle rather than a sniper rifle.\n\nThe Hero Charger Replica comes with Splat Bombs and the Bomb Rush.\n\nTo unlock the Hero Charger Replica, the player must play the last set of missions from the Inkling Girl amiibo:\n\n- 23. Spongy Observatory\n\n- 25. Far-Flung Flooders\n\n- 27.

However it is once again a re-skinned Splat Charger, which therefore now comes with Splat Bombs and Sting Ray, along with the newfound ability to store a charge for one second. To unlock the Hero Charger Replica, the player must now complete every level with the Hero Charger in Octo Canyon.\n\n- Unlike Damage Up in Splatoon, while Main Power Up increases damage, it does not allow shots below full charge to reach 100.0 damage.\n\n- The Hero Charger Replica is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 260.

This weapon came about after I made a breakthrough in my research and managed to create the ultimate weapon! Sadly, it never made it to mass production because the guys at the factory couldn't wrap their heads around my advanced schematics... So instead they just slapped some shiny parts on a standard Splat Charger and called it the Hero Charger Replica. Give it a shot!\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- Hero weapons with the Hero Charger Replica in the top-right\n\n- Marie using the Hero Charger that the replica is based on during Bomb Rush Blush (Note that her weapon seems to be the Splatoon version)\n\n- A Splashtag banner with the Hero Charger Replica in the top-right corner.\n\nFor competitive tips about the Hero Charger Replica\n\nNote: the strategy advice for Splat Charger also applies to Hero Charger Replica, so they share the same strategy page.\n\n- Marie's main weapon is shown to be the Hero Charger as it appears in Splatoon or its replica, likely from her time in the role of Agent 2. This is shown in her artwork for the Show No Mercy! vs. Focus on Healing Splatfest.\n\n- Along with the Order Charger Replica, the Hero Charger Replica is the only variant of the Splat Charger to not have a scoped version."
