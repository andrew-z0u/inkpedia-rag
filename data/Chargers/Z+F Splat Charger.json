Now, that cool brand doesn't make the weapon any more powerful, or anything, but you will get an entirely new loadout to play around with! Take, for example, the Splash Wall. It's a great accessory for a charging weapon because it allows you to take cover while the main weapon, well, charges up! And it comes with the fearsome Triple Inkstrike special! Whether you use it to probe for hiding enemies or holding down the fort, it's a beast. If you want to be THAT charger user, give this set a try.\n\n- Promotional render\n\n- The Z+F Splat Charger shown in the Fresh Season 2023 promotional poster\n\n- The Inkling on the right wields the Z+F Splat Charger\n\n- 2D icon.\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Z+F Splat Charger.\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Z%2BF_Splat_Charger_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nModel of the Z+F Splat Charger rotating (link to file)"
