    "The New Squiffer is a main weapon in the Splatoon series. It is the same as the Classic Squiffer, but with a changed appearance and a different sub weapon and special weapon.",
    "In Splatoon and Splatoon 2, the New Squiffer is nearly identical in appearance to the Classic Squiffer. The only difference between the two is that the New Squiffer has a red and yellow starburst sticker with some white Inkling text stuck on the bottle.",
    "In Splatoon 3, the New Squiffer features a new thinner, rectangular bottle design. As opposed to the usual blue of the Classic Squiffer, the New Squiffer features a more green color. The red and yellow sticker is still present, however.",
    "The New Squiffer comes with the Ink Mines and the Inkzooka.",
    "[1]",
    "My grandpappy's blueprints inspired me to update the Classic Squiffer set. I call it the New Squiffer! Use the Inkzooka to keep foes at bay as you surround your territory with deadly Ink Mines! Charger-type weapons are generally offensive, but a defensive style can be surprisingly effective too!",
    "The New Squiffer was released on 25 April 2018 at 02:00 UTC.[2] It comes with Autobombs and the Baller.",
    "[3]",
    "The New Squiffer offers the same main stats as the Classic Squiffer, but it offers a more offensive style! Pressure your opponents with an Autobomb, and splat 'em when they come out into the open! And when you're under pressure, use the Baller to rush the enemy or retreat. This baby is made for ultra-aggressive players.",
    "The New Squiffer returns in Splatoon 3, featuring a new design and color. It was added in the Fresh Season 2024 update. Its kit features Autobombs and the Zipcaster special.",
    "[4][5]",
    "The New Squiffer boasts the same main stats as the Classic Squiffer, but it offers a more offensive style! Between your charged shots and the Autobomb sub weapon, there'll be nowhere for your opponents to hide. And if they do find a place to hunker down, your Zipcaster special can get you repositioned in a flash. Charge while you're in the air, and splat 'em before they can blink! There are lots of ways to go on the offensive with this kit. If you love chargers but don't want to stick to the back line, give it a shot!",
