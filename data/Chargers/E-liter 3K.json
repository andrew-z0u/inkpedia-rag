    "The E-liter 3K(NA), or E-Litre 3K(EU/OC), is a main weapon in Splatoon.",
    "The E-liter 3K is a charger-type weapon that sacrifices mobility, ink consumption and charge time for extreme range. Like most other chargers, it can instantly splat with a high enough charge. This weapon has a scoped variant.",
    "In later installments, this weapon was replaced with an updated version called the E-liter 4K.",
    "The E-liter 3K consists of a metal ink tank connected to a long metal tube that serves as a barrel via a dark-green attachment that also houses the trigger and handhold. A black tube connects the ink tank to the attachment. On the barrel just above the attachment are six stripes that change color to match the user's ink. About halfway up the barrel is another green attachment.",
    "The E-liter 3K comes with the Burst Bomb sub and the Echolocator special.",

    "- SplatNet icon",
    "- The E-liter 3K is designed to look like a gas pump.",
    "- A disassembled E-liter 3K can be seen in Splatoon 2's test range.",
    "- The E-liter 3K and E-liter 3K Scope are the only main weapons that have ever consumed more ink than their sub weapon. Prior to Splatoon version 2.7.0, Burst Bombs consumed 25% of an ink tank, which is less than the 30% for full charge shots.",
    "- The E-liter 3K and its variants are created by Custom.",
    "- Across all three games, the E-Liter 3K (4K in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3) has the same special as the Custom Splattershot Jr.",
    "- Excluding Dual Squelcher, E-liter 3K (and 4K) is the only weapon from the original Splatoon to have never recieved a third variant.",
    "E-liter is a pun between elite and liter (the metric measurement). The 3K in E-liter 3K refers to number of fully charged shots the weapon can make before running out of ink, three."
