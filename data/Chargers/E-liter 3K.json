    "The E-liter 3K(NA), or E-Litre 3K(EU/OC), is a main weapon in Splatoon.",
    "The E-liter 3K is a charger-type weapon that sacrifices mobility, ink consumption and charge time for extreme range. Like most other chargers, it can instantly splat with a high enough charge. This weapon has a scoped variant.",
    "In later installments, this weapon was replaced with an updated version called the E-liter 4K.",
    "The E-liter 3K consists of a metal ink tank connected to a long metal tube that serves as a barrel via a dark-green attachment that also houses the trigger and handhold. A black tube connects the ink tank to the attachment. On the barrel just above the attachment are six stripes that change color to match the user's ink. About halfway up the barrel is another green attachment.",
    "The E-liter 3K comes with the Burst Bomb sub and the Echolocator special.",
    "[1]",
    "The E-liter 3K is designed to withstand extreme pressure, allowing you to charge it up even further! As a result, it has incredible range and truly fearsome attack power! It's great for forging a path forward. Hit nearby foes with Burst Bombs, and then make sure they've got nowhere to hide with the Echolocator!(NA)",
    "E-liter is a pun between elite and liter (the metric measurement). The 3K in E-liter 3K refers to number of fully charged shots the weapon can make before running out of ink, three.",
