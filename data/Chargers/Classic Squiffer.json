    "The Classic Squiffer is a main weapon in the Splatoon series, manufactured by the \"D\" brand.",
    "The Classic Squiffer is a charger-type weapon that charges faster than a Splat Charger, and uses less ink, but has less range.",
    "At the back end of the Classic Squiffer is a light-blue bottle of cleaning spray with a blue label sticker. Said sticker has the Dolphin logo on it. The part of the spray bottle that attaches the bottle to the nozzle is blue and much longer than usual, extending almost to the end of the nozzle and then wrapping around and going almost all the way back. The handle and trigger have been combined with and situated at the back end of the attaching piece. The nozzle itself is white with supports that change color to match the user's ink.",
    "In Splatoon 3, the weapon's spray bottle now has a different design. There is now duct tape wrapped around the bottom and near the cap and a rubber band around the barrel and the now transparent blue frame.",
    "The Classic Squiffer comes with a set of Point Sensor and Bubbler.",
    "[1]",
    "The Classic Squiffer - for a charge weapon, it's lacking in range, but in return it can charge up much faster. Use the Bubbler to get in close after zeroing in on your opponents with the Point Sensor! This set is an excellent choice for fighters who are confident taking out foes with a decisive shot.(NA)",
    "The Classic Squiffer was released on 19 August 2017 at 02:00 UTC.[2] It comes with Point Sensors and Ink Armor.",
    "Starting with Splatoon 2 version 2.2.0, the Squiffer has the unique property among chargers of charging at full speed in the air.",
    "It appears in five Octo Expansion stations:",
    "[3]",
    "The Classic Squiffer. For a charger, it's a bit short on range, but in return it can charge up much quicker. Use the Point Sensor to sniff out hidden opponents, allowing you and your allies to overrun and outnumber marked enemies! Even though it's a charger, the short charge time and the power when using the Ink Armor special allow you to jump into the fray! This set is great for the Inkling who's confident with a charger in close quarters.",
    "The Classic Squiffer returns in Splatoon 3, showing a new design. Its kit consists of Point Sensor and Big Bubbler.",
    "It appears in six missions in Return of the Mammalians:",
    "[4][5]",
    "Ah, the Classic Squiffer. For a charger, it's a bit short on range, but in return it can charge up much more quickly. That allows you to use it in a more offensive way! I mean... being on the offense. Not that the weapon is offensive... except to your opponents. Anyway, I'd take advantage of the Point Sensor sub to coordinate an attack with my teammates. And if my home turf was invaded, I'd deploy the Big Bubbler and hide inside, using that Classic Squiffer action to snipe enemies. Comfy in close range with a charger? This set is for you!",

    "Squiffer is a portmanteau of \"squid\" and \"Swiffer\", an American brand of cleaning products, while Classic denotes that it is the default variant of the Squiffer.",
