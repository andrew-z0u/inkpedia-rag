Said sticker has the Dolphin logo on it. The part of the spray bottle that attaches the bottle to the nozzle is blue and much longer than usual, extending almost to the end of the nozzle and then wrapping around and going almost all the way back. The handle and trigger have been combined with and situated at the back end of the attaching piece. The nozzle itself is white with supports that change color to match the user's ink.\n\nIn Splatoon 3, the weapon's spray bottle now has a different design. There is now duct tape wrapped around the bottom and near the cap and a rubber band around the barrel and the now transparent blue frame.\n\nThe Classic Squiffer comes with a set of Point Sensor and Bubbler.\n\n- The Classic Squiffer is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- Ink consumption scales from 1.87% to 10.5% depending on the charge level.\nThe full-charge ink consumption of 10.5% allows players to fire 9 shots before needing to refill the ink supply.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- The full-charge ink consumption of 10.5% allows players to fire 9 shots before needing to refill the ink supply.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- The Classic Squiffer cannot store its charge.\n\n- It takes 0.75 seconds to fully charge the weapon.\nWhen charging a shot with an empty tank, the charge rate is 25%, permitting the player to fully charge a shot in 3 seconds.\n\n- When charging a shot with an empty tank, the charge rate is 25%, permitting the player to fully charge a shot in 3 seconds.\n\n- Shots cannot pierce through enemies.\n\n- When charging while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.3 units per frame.\n\n- Damage scales from 40 to 70 depending on the charge level.

Use the Bubbler to get in close after zeroing in on your opponents with the Point Sensor! This set is an excellent choice for fighters who are confident taking out foes with a decisive shot.(NA)\n\n- A promotional image of the Classic Squiffer.\n\n- An Inkling using the Classic Squiffer.\n\n- An Inkling (center) holding the Classic Squiffer.\n\n- Sunken Scroll 18, with the Classic Squiffer at the lower right.\n\n- Official art of an Inkling holding the Classic Squiffer.\n\n- A pre-release screenshot with the original name and sub weapon of the Classic Squiffer.\n\n- Render of an Inkling aiming the Classic Squiffer.\n\n- Render of the Classic Squiffer.\n\n- SplatNet icon\n\nThe Classic Squiffer was released on 19 August 2017 at 02:00 UTC.[2] It comes with Point Sensors and Ink Armor.\n\nStarting with Splatoon 2 version 2.2.0, the Squiffer has the unique property among chargers of charging at full speed in the air.\n\nIt appears in five Octo Expansion stations:\n\n- C03A08 Bumpin' 8-Ball Station\n\n- C06 Bust 'n' Move Station\n\n- F02 Slow Ride Station\n\n- F06 Duh-Oh Station\n\n- I04 Can't Touch This Station\n\n- The Classic Squiffer is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 185.

That allows you to use it in a more offensive way! I mean... being on the offense. Not that the weapon is offensive... except to your opponents. Anyway, I'd take advantage of the Point Sensor sub to coordinate an attack with my teammates. And if my home turf was invaded, I'd deploy the Big Bubbler and hide inside, using that Classic Squiffer action to snipe enemies. Comfy in close range with a charger?

Some other weapons that share this distinction are the Dark Tetra Dualies, the Nautilus 47, Snipewriter 5H, and the Mint Decavitator.\n\n- The Squiffer was originally called \"Quick Ink Rifle\", as seen in an image from before Splatoon's release, and it came with Splat Bombs and Bubbler. This set was later given to the Splattershot Jr. and Splat Bombs were given to the Splat Charger and Splatterscope.\n\n- In all three games, the Classic Squiffer has had Point Sensor as its sub weapon and various forms of a protection-based special weapon.\n\n- When Point Sensor comes up on Judd's trials, the player is equipped with the Classic Squiffer.\n\nSquiffer is a portmanteau of \"squid\" and \"Swiffer\", an American brand of cleaning products, while Classic denotes that it is the default variant of the Squiffer."
