    "The Herobrush Replica is a main weapon in Splatoon 2.",
    "The Herobrush Replica shares its overall design with the Octobrush. However, the Herobrush Replica has a mainly black handle with lime and blue highlights instead of a brown handle with highlights that match the user's ink color. The Herobrush Replica also has darker bristles.",
    "The Herobrush Replica is visually identical to the Level 1 Herobrush but is simply a re-skinned Octobrush. Therefore, unlike the switchable sub weapons of the Herobrush, it comes with Autobombs and the Inkjet. To unlock the Herobrush Replica, the player must complete every level with the Herobrush in Octo Canyon, in which it becomes available for purchase at Ammo Knights.",
