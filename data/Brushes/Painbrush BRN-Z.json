Whitish text is stamped under the joint of the swiveling brush head in a hyphenated format, possibly resembling a serial number. A packet resembling a field ration packet stamped with Barazushi's logo is attached to the side of the weapon, and the small ring separating the handle from the rest of the weapon is a dark green. This small ring never changes color to match the user's ink, unlike the original Painbrush.\n\nThe Painbrush BRN-Z was added as part of the Splatlands Collection on 12 June 2025. It comes with the Splash Wall sub and Trizooka special weapon.\n\n- The Painbrush BRN-Z is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 13.1. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- Ink consumption per second while sliding is 10.8%.\n\n- While sliding, the player's movement speed is set to 0.18 units per frame.\n\n- After sliding, there is a 20 frame second cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Hitting an opponent while sliding deals 30 damage.\n\n- While sliding, the Painbrush BRN-Z leaves an ink trail that is 2.6 units wide.\n\n- The ink consumption of 4.8% allows players to attack 20 times before needing to refill the ink supply.\n\n- When attacking, it takes 23 frames to start swinging the brush.\n\n- The weapon can be swung every 13 frames (4.62 times per second).\n\n- When attacking while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.024 units per frame.\n\n- After swinging, there is a 50 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Attacks have a base damage of 60.\n\n- For normal attacks, ink loses damage based on distance traveled. Ink starts losing damage at 5.0 units and stops losing damage at 13.0 units. The minimum damage before time-based falloff is applied is 31.\n\n- If a glob of ink is in the air for more than 24 frames after being flung, it loses damage each frame until frame 45, at which point it will deal 50% of its original damage. Thus, the minimum damage that can be dealt per glob is is 15.5.\n\n- Damage does not change based on the angle of the ink.\n\n[1][2]\n\n- ▼ Points to fill special gauge: 180 → 190.\n\nThe Painbrush BRN-Z from Barazushi features a stunning bronze design, but this is not a weapon that's willing to accept third place! With the Splash Wall sub weapon to stake out a safe spot and the Trizooka special to add range and power, this loadout is well-balanced and reliable. If you can patiently wait for the right moment to turn the tables all at once, I'd recommend that you give this set a try!\n\n- Promotional render\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- Holographic sticker\n\n- Promotional image of the Splatlands Collection - Barazushi weapons\n\n- Another promotional image, with Painbrush BRN-Z down\n\n- The Painbrush BRN-Z on the Splatlands Collection first trailer\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Painbrush_BRN-Z_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nPromotional video (link to file)\n\n- The original tweet announcing this weapon accidentally refers to it as the Paintbrush BRN-Z.\n\n- The Painbrush BRN-Z shares its rusty design and its Barazushi field ration with other weapons in the Splatlands Collection: the Tri-Slosher ASH-N and the Splatana Wiper RUS-T.\n\nThe suffix \"BRN-Z\" is a stylized spelling of the word bronze, referencing the weapon's design."
