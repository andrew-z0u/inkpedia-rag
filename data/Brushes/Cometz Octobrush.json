The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- Ink consumption per second while sliding is 9%.\n\n- While sliding, the player's movement speed is set to 0.168 units per frame.\n\n- After sliding, there is a 20 frame second cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Hitting an opponent while sliding deals 25 damage.\n\n- While sliding, the Cometz Octobrush leaves an ink trail that is 1.8 units wide.\n\n- The ink consumption of 3% allows players to attack 33 times before needing to refill the ink supply.\n\n- When attacking, it takes 1 frame to start swinging the brush.\n\n- The weapon can be swung every 10 frames (6 times per second).\n\n- When attacking while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.03 units per frame.\n\n- After swinging, there is a 30 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Attacks have a base damage of 40.\n\n- For normal attacks, ink loses damage based on distance traveled. Ink starts losing damage at 3.3 units and stops losing damage at 14.3 units. The minimum damage before time-based falloff is applied is 20.\n\n- If a glob of ink is in the air for more than 24 frames after being flung, it loses damage each frame until frame 45, at which point it will deal 50% of its original damage. Thus, the minimum damage that can be dealt per glob is is 10.\n\n- Damage does not change based on the angle of the ink.\n\n[1][2]\n\n- ▲ Points to fill special gauge: 200 → 190.\n\nWhat if you had a heavy Octobrush that was still light enough to whip through the night sky? Enter the Cometz Octobrush, an Emberz collab that sparkles with possibility! As with other brushes, this weapon shines brightest in close combat, so be sure to use your Autobomb sub to not-so-gently nudge your foes into the open. And when the moment is right? Release the Kraken Royale for an invincible burst of firepower. It should be obvious, but I recommend this set for aggressive players!\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- Promotional image of the Emberz collection\n\nThe word cometz is a stylized spelling of the word comets."
