    "What if you had a heavy Octobrush that was still light enough to whip through the night sky? Enter the Cometz Octobrush, an Emberz collab that sparkles with possibility! As with other brushes, this weapon shines brightest in close combat, so be sure to use your Autobomb sub to not-so-gently nudge your foes into the open. And when the moment is right? Release the Kraken Royale for an invincible burst of firepower. It should be obvious, but I recommend this set for aggressive players!",
