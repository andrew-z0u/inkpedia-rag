    "The Inkbrush is a main weapon in the Splatoon series.",
    "As a brush, when  is pressed, it flicks weak, short-ranged ink in front of the user, which can be done repeatedly at a fast rate to ink turf or splat opponents. If  is held, the user pushes the Inkbrush along the ground, leaving a thin trail of ink as the user runs at a fast speed.",
    "Compared to the Octobrush, the Inkbrush has faster movement and swing speed and lower ink consumption at the cost of less range, damage, and painted turf per swing and thinner ink trail when running.",
    "The Inkbrush is designed with a paint tube in the middle, connected to paintbrush bristles and a blue handle with a textured black grip. The paint tube shows the player's ink color on the label, and a glob of the player's ink coats the bristles.",
    "The Inkbrush was released on 6 June 2015 at 02:00 UTC,[1] under the roller class. It comes with Sprinklers and the Inkstrike.",
    "When using the Inkbrush, the player's Inkling holds the weapon on the right-hand side of its body. Usually, this does not affect the gameplay, but if a player makes a sharp left turn while in enemy ink, they get stuck in the ink.",
    "When flicking the Inkbrush, there is a random chance that more than one glob of ink hits the opponent.",
