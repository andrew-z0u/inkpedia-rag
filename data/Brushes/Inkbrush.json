    "The Inkbrush is a main weapon in the Splatoon series.",
    "As a brush, when  is pressed, it flicks weak, short-ranged ink in front of the user, which can be done repeatedly at a fast rate to ink turf or splat opponents. If  is held, the user pushes the Inkbrush along the ground, leaving a thin trail of ink as the user runs at a fast speed.",
    "Compared to the Octobrush, the Inkbrush has faster movement and swing speed and lower ink consumption at the cost of less range, damage, and painted turf per swing and thinner ink trail when running.",
    "The Inkbrush is designed with a paint tube in the middle, connected to paintbrush bristles and a blue handle with a textured black grip. The paint tube shows the player's ink color on the label, and a glob of the player's ink coats the bristles.",
    "The Inkbrush was released on 6 June 2015 at 02:00 UTC,[1] under the roller class. It comes with Sprinklers and the Inkstrike.",
    "When using the Inkbrush, the player's Inkling holds the weapon on the right-hand side of its body. Usually, this does not affect the gameplay, but if a player makes a sharp left turn while in enemy ink, they get stuck in the ink.",
    "When flicking the Inkbrush, there is a random chance that more than one glob of ink hits the opponent.",
    "[2]",
    "The Inkbrush is similar to roller weapons, but it inks the ground as fast as you can dash! It's weak and a bit narrow, but you can make up for that with Sprinklers and Inkstrikes! I would recommend this weapon to anyone who wishes to try out a new type of fighting style!(NA)",
    "This is the Inkbrush! It's similar to Roller weapons, but it paints the ground as fast as a squid can dash! It's weak and a bit narrow, but you can make up for that with Sprinklers and Inkstrikes! I would recommend this weapon to anyone who wishes to try out a new type of fighting style!(EU/OC)",
    "The Inkbrush returns in Splatoon 2. It was released on 23 July 2017 at 02:00 UTC.[3] It comes with Splat Bombs and Splashdown.",
    "It appears in five Octo Expansion stations:",
    "[4][5]",
    "The Inkbrush is a super-light brush weapon that lets you ink your way forward with blistering speed! It's not terribly strong, but you can make up for that by pairing that lightning speed with a Splat Bomb to confound your opponents! Splashdown will further stir up the front lines, so I'd put this set in the hands of those who like to disrupt the battlefield.",
    "The Inkbrush returns in Splatoon 3, now classified as a separate brush class. It comes with Splat Bombs and the Killer Wail 5.1. It was originally shown in a New Year 2022 teaser on Twitter,[6] looking similar to how it does in the previous games, with the difference being that its bristles are darker, resembling the Permanent Inkbrush's bristles, but more saturated.",
    "It appears in three missions in Return of the Mammalians:",
    "[7][8]",
    "The Inkbrush is a super-light brush weapon that lets you ink your way forward with blistering speed! There's not much room for power when you're moving that fast, but you can keep counterattacks at bay with plenty of Splat Bombs. Add the Killer Wail 5.1 to the mix, and you've got a combo that will confuse and annoy your opponents into submission! I can see it now... You blaze across battle lines... toss a Splat Bomb, and trigger the Killer Wail just in time to headbang along as the clock runs out. Whew! That's inking outside the box!",
    "For competitive tips about the Inkbrush",
    "The Inkbrush appears as Inkling's forward smash attack in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, alongside a variety of other weapons that she uses in her attacks.",
    "When attacking, she charges up and swings the Inkbrush forwards to deal damage. This also coats opponents in ink but does not ink the ground. It deals much lower damage if Inkling is out of ink.",
    "Inkbrush is literally ink + brush, and may be taken from real-life ink brushes used for calligraphy.",
    "Additionally, when taken alongside the name of its fellow brush-class weapon, the Octobrush, it may be meant to reflect the name of Inklings.",
