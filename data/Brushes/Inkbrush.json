  "content": "The Inkbrush is a main weapon in the Splatoon series.\n\nAs a brush, when  is pressed, it flicks weak, short-ranged ink in front of the user, which can be done repeatedly at a fast rate to ink turf or splat opponents. If  is held, the user pushes the Inkbrush along the ground, leaving a thin trail of ink as the user runs at a fast speed.\n\nCompared to the Octobrush, the Inkbrush has faster movement and swing speed and lower ink consumption at the cost of less range, damage, and painted turf per swing and thinner ink trail when running.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Splatoon\n\n2.1 Data\n2.2 Version history\n2.3 Quotes\n2.4 Gallery\n2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3 Splatoon 2\n\n3.1 Data\n\n3.1.1 Flinging ink\n\n\n3.2 Version history\n3.3 Quotes\n3.4 Gallery\n3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n3.1.1 Flinging ink\n\n- 3.1.1 Flinging ink\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 4 Splatoon 3\n\n4.1 Data\n\n4.1.1 Flinging ink\n\n\n4.2 Version history\n4.3 Quotes\n4.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n4.5 Gallery\n\n- 4.1 Data\n\n4.1.1 Flinging ink\n\n- 4.1.1 Flinging ink\n\n- 4.2 Version history\n\n- 4.3 Quotes\n\n- 4.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 4.5 Gallery\n\n- 5 Strategy\n\n- 6 Super Smash Bros.

The paint tube shows the player's ink color on the label, and a glob of the player's ink coats the bristles.\n\nThe Inkbrush was released on 6 June 2015 at 02:00 UTC,[1] under the roller class. It comes with Sprinklers and the Inkstrike.\n\nWhen using the Inkbrush, the player's Inkling holds the weapon on the right-hand side of its body. Usually, this does not affect the gameplay, but if a player makes a sharp left turn while in enemy ink, they get stuck in the ink.\n\nWhen flicking the Inkbrush, there is a random chance that more than one glob of ink hits the opponent.\n\n- The Inkbrush is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- Ink consumption while rolling is 8.1% per second.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- Ink consumption per attack is 2%.\nThis allows players to attack 50 times before needing to refill the ink supply.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This allows players to attack 50 times before needing to refill the ink supply.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This allows players to attack 50 times before needing to refill the ink supply.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- When attacking with a depleted ink tank, ink will not be flung until enough ink has recovered.\n\n- Rolling with a depleted ink tank will not leave a trail or damage opponents.\n\n- The Inkbrush can be swung every 6 frames (10 swings per second).\n\n- When rolling, the player's movement speed is set to 1.92 units per frame.\n\n- When rolling on an uninkable surface or with a depleted ink tank, the player's movement speed is set to 0.96 units per frame.\n\n- After rolling, there is a 0.33 second cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- After swinging, there is a 0.5 second cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Hitting an opponent while rolling deals 20 damage.\n\n- Attacks have a base damage of 28.\nThis weapon has a critical damage mechanic, so the damage dealt with one swing may be higher than this value.\n\n- This weapon has a critical damage mechanic, so the damage dealt with one swing may be higher than this value.\n\n- For normal attacks, ink loses damage based on distance traveled.

It's weak and a bit narrow, but you can make up for that with Sprinklers and Inkstrikes! I would recommend this weapon to anyone who wishes to try out a new type of fighting style!(NA)\n\nThis is the Inkbrush!

Splashdown will further stir up the front lines, so I'd put this set in the hands of those who like to disrupt the battlefield.\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- An Inkling boy swinging an Inkbrush\n\n- An Inkling boy rolling an Inkbrush\n\n- An Inkbrush found behind the Inkling girl on the right\n\n- A render of an Inkling holding an Inkbrush\n\n- An Inkling girl holding an Inkbrush\n\nThe Inkbrush returns in Splatoon 3, now classified as a separate brush class. It comes with Splat Bombs and the Killer Wail 5.1. It was originally shown in a New Year 2022 teaser on Twitter,[6] looking similar to how it does in the previous games, with the difference being that its bristles are darker, resembling the Permanent Inkbrush's bristles, but more saturated.\n\nIt appears in three missions in Return of the Mammalians:\n\n- 0305 Conveyor-Belt Tightening\n\n- 0412 The Path to Perfect Penmanship\n\n- 0505 A Compulsive Collector's Paradise\n\n- The Inkbrush is a lightweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 7.

There's not much room for power when you're moving that fast, but you can keep counterattacks at bay with plenty of Splat Bombs. Add the Killer Wail 5.1 to the mix, and you've got a combo that will confuse and annoy your opponents into submission! I can see it now... You blaze across battle lines... toss a Splat Bomb, and trigger the Killer Wail just in time to headbang along as the clock runs out. Whew!

Ultimate, alongside a variety of other weapons that she uses in her attacks.\n\nWhen attacking, she charges up and swings the Inkbrush forwards to deal damage. This also coats opponents in ink but does not ink the ground. It deals much lower damage if Inkling is out of ink.\n\n- The ink reservoir below the brush's head seems to made from an oil paint tube, fitting in with the art theme.\n\n- In Splatoon, this weapon and its variants are tied with the Luna Blaster and its variant for the shortest range stat in the game. It also has the shortest range stat in Splatoon 2.\n\n- According to The Art of Splatoon, around every ten matches, the Inkbrush's tube needs to be replaced.\n\n- In Splatoon 2, the Inkbrush was the first post-release weapon to added.\n\n- As of version 4.1.0, the Inkbrush has the lowest possible damage output of all main, sub and special weapons in Splatoon 2 at 7.5 damage per swing.\n\n- In Splatoon 2, the Inkbrush is tied with the Undercover Brella for the lowest base special cost in Splatoon 2, at 150p, being the cheapest special in the entire Splatoon series.\n\n- Despite appearing in numerous trailers and promotional art before the release of Splatoon, the Inkbrush was not available to use until it was added in a post-launch update.\n\n- In the trailer for Splatoon 3, multiple Inkbrushes are displayed hanging in the Ammo Knights building interior, visible through the glass window to the right of the door.\n\n- The Inkbrush was one of the weapons available to use in the Splatoon 3 Splatfest World Premiere.\n\nInkbrush is literally ink + brush, and may be taken from real-life ink brushes used for calligraphy.\n\nAdditionally, when taken alongside the name of its fellow brush-class weapon, the Octobrush, it may be meant to reflect the name of Inklings."
