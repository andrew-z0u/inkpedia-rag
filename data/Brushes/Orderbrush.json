  "content": "The Orderbrush is a brush in Splatoon 3 that is exclusively used in Side Order.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Description\n\n- 3 Gallery\n\n- 4 Names in other languages\n\nThe Orderbrush has a minimalist appearance, with a white molded support and bristles for the body of the weapon, as well as a metallic silver handle. Its appearance is similar to that of a Octobrush. When used, ring-shaped holograms manifest around the handle of the brush.\n\nThe Orderbrush is a weapon unlocked in Side Order, and is part of Sheldon's Palette. Its base set consists of Ink Mines and Ultra Stamp, notably identical to the Inkbrush Nouveau's set in Splatoon 3. However, this can be changed in the Spire of Order by using a vending machine.\n\nIt has lower stats in comparison to the Octobrush, with a slower ink flick, strafe speed, brush speed, ink efficiency, ink coverage, and range, but has higher damage. However, this can be upgraded through color chips in the Spire of Order.\n\n- The clear screen for the Orderbrush\n\n- The fail screen for the Orderbrush"
