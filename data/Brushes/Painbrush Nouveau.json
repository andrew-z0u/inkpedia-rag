    "The Painbrush Nouveau is a main weapon in Splatoon 3. It is the Nouveau-branded version of the Painbrush.",
    "The Painbrush Nouveau looks similar to the Painbrush, however it has brown bristles and a gold tint similar to that of the Gold Dynamo Roller. It has a Nouveau sticker wrapped around the handle just below the brush head. The ring separating the handle from the rest of the weapon never changes color, unlike the original version. The handle itself is a much darker wood than the original Painbrush.",
    "The Painbrush Nouveau was added as part of Chill Season 2023. It comes with the Point Sensor sub and Tenta Missiles special weapon.",
