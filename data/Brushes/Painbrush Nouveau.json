It has a Nouveau sticker wrapped around the handle just below the brush head. The ring separating the handle from the rest of the weapon never changes color, unlike the original version. The handle itself is a much darker wood than the original Painbrush.\n\nThe Painbrush Nouveau was added as part of Chill Season 2023. It comes with the Point Sensor sub and Tenta Missiles special weapon.\n\n- The Painbrush Nouveau is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 13.1. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- Ink consumption per second while sliding is 10.8%.\n\n- While sliding, the player's movement speed is set to 0.18 units per frame.\n\n- After sliding, there is a 20 frame second cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Hitting an opponent while sliding deals 30 damage.\n\n- While sliding, the Painbrush Nouveau leaves an ink trail that is 2.6 units wide.\n\n- The ink consumption of 4.8% allows players to attack 20 times before needing to refill the ink supply.\n\n- When attacking, it takes 23 frames to start swinging the brush.\n\n- The weapon can be swung every 13 frames (4.62 times per second).\n\n- When attacking while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.024 units per frame.\n\n- After swinging, there is a 50 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Attacks have a base damage of 60.\n\n- For normal attacks, ink loses damage based on distance traveled. Ink starts losing damage at 5.0 units and stops losing damage at 13.0 units. The minimum damage before time-based falloff is applied is 31.\n\n- If a glob of ink is in the air for more than 24 frames after being flung, it loses damage each frame until frame 45, at which point it will deal 50% of its original damage. Thus, the minimum damage that can be dealt per glob is is 15.5.\n\n- Damage does not change based on the angle of the ink.\n\n[1][2]\n\n- ▲ Increased inking width when holding  to ink while moving forward by approximately 18%: 2.2 units → 2.6 units.\n\n- ▲ Shortened the time before ink starts recovering after holding  to ink while moving forward by approximately 1/6th of a second: 30 frames → 20 frames.\n\n- ▲ Shortened the interval between continuous swings by approximately 1/30th of a second: 15 frames → 13 frames.\n\nYou wouldn't paint a house and a miniature with the same paintbrush, would you? Well, the same applies to battle, and that's why I offer the Painbrush Nouveau! Granted, it technically IS the same as the base Painbrush, but with a new loadout, it offers a totally different battle experience. I'll explain, of course! The Point Sensor sub allows you to mark enemies, making it all the easier to glide up and splat them with your brush. Didn't get 'em all? Wipe the canvas clear with Tenta Missiles! I think you'll find the other team has nowhere to hide when you master the use of this powerful brush loadout.\n\n- Promotional render\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- Holographic sticker\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Painbrush Nouveau\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Painbrush_Nouveau_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nModel of the Painbrush Nouveau rotating (link to file)\n\n\"Nouveau\" is the brand which created the original Painbrush."
