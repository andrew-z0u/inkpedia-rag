    "The Octobrush Nouveau is a main weapon in the Splatoon series. It is the Nouveau-branded version of the Octobrush.",
    "The Octobrush Nouveau is nearly identical to the Octobrush. In Splatoon and Splatoon 2, the only difference between the two is that the Octobrush Nouveau has a sticker bearing the Nouveau logo near the front of the handle.",
    "In Splatoon 3, the wooden handle is a lighter color.",
    "The Octobrush Nouveau was released on 1 January 2016 at 10:00 UTC.[1] The Octobrush Nouveau is a variation of the Octobrush, maintaining the same stats, but instead comes with Splat Bombs and the Inkzooka. This weapon has a critical damage mechanic, sometimes allowing for two-hit splats. The probability of scoring a two-hit splat can be increased using Damage Up.",
    "[2]",
    "The Octobrush Nouveau matches the Octobrush in stats but features an all-new Sub and Special setup!\nMore specifically, it comes with the versatile Splat Bomb and Inkzooka for maximum ease of use.\nBrushes are a fun weapon type to use, so I'd use this set to get the hang of using brushes.(NA)",

    "The Octobrush Nouveau was released on 2 January 2018 at 02:00 UTC.[3] It comes with Squid Beakons and the Tenta Missiles for a more support-focused playstyle.",
    "[4][5]",
    "The Octobrush Nouveau matches the Octobrush in stats but encourages a more supportive play style!\nPlace Squid Beakons carefully and strategically, allowing your team to coordinate offensively and rush the enemy together!\nYou can support your buds on the front line using the Tenta Missiles, making this weapon set perfect for the true team player.",
    "The Octobrush Nouveau returns in Splatoon 3 as part of the Drizzle Season 2023. Its design is slightly updated, with its base now being a different type of wood. Its kit consists of Squid Beakon and Ink Storm.",
    "[6][7]",
    "Nouveau means \"new,\" and Octobrush means \"Octobrush,\" so the Octobrush Nouveau is like a \"new Octobrush\"! That said, it offers the same level of performance you may already know from the Octobrush but with a loadout designed for teamwork. Use your Squid Beakons to rally teammates to critical spots on the map, whether attacking or retreating. Nothing zips you back to the fray as quickly! And when you're on the front line, the Ink Storm special is a great way to hold your position. I recommend this set for aggressive players who splat and get splatted up front!",
    "For competitive tips about the Octobrush Nouveau",
    "Octobrush is a combination of octo (Latin for \"eight\"; likely referring the octopus-shaped ink reservoir) and brush. The suffix Nouveau is used to differentiate it from the Octobrush and might also referring the Art Nouveau. This trait is shared among the other alternate sets of the Nouveau brand.",
