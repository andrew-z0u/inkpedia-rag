    "The Painbrush is a main weapon in Splatoon 3, manufactured by Nouveau. It is a brush with higher power and range than other weapons in its class.",
    "The Painbrush resembles a fan brush with a slit in its bristles. Its silver, metallic handle resembles a palette cup. On the handle near the bristles, the Nouveau logo can be seen, colored white. The ring separating the handle from the rest of the weapon changes color matching user's color. The handle is made of wood.",
    "The Painbrush was revealed on 16 May 2023 in the Sizzle Season 2023 trailer[1] and was released on 1 June 2023. Its kit consists of Curling Bomb and Wave Breaker.",
    "As a brush, when  is pressed, it rapidly flicks splashes of ink in front of the user with higher damage and longer range compared with other brushes, but as a tradeoff it possesses a long windup on the first of a series of swings and a narrower spread of ink left on surfaces with each swing. If  is held, the user will push the Painbrush along the ground, leaving a trail of ink as the user runs at a fast speed comparable to that of the Octobrush, but with a wider ink trail.",

    "- The Painbrush is not included in Return of the Mammalians due to being added post-release.",
    "- The Painbrush is the first new entry in the brush class since the original roster from Splatoon.",
    "- The Painbrush is the only brush since the original Splatoon to have the ability to splat an enemy in two hits.",
    "- Despite its metallic appearance similar to the Dynamo Roller, the Aerospray and the Nautilus, the Painbrush isn't an Ammo Knights weapon, but a Nouveau one.",
    "Painbrush is a combination of the words pain, referencing the high damage of the weapon, and brush while also being a pun on paintbrush."
