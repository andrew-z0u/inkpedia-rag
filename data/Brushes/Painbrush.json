It is a brush with higher power and range than other weapons in its class.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Splatoon 3\n\n2.1 Data\n\n2.1.1 Flinging ink\n\n\n2.2 Version history\n2.3 Quotes\n2.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n2.5 Gallery\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n2.1.1 Flinging ink\n\n- 2.1.1 Flinging ink\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 2.5 Gallery\n\n- 3 Strategy\n\n- 4 Trivia\n\n- 5 Etymology\n\n5.1 Names in other languages\n5.2 Translation notes\n\n- 5.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 5.2 Translation notes\n\n- 6 References\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n2.1.1 Flinging ink\n\n- 2.1.1 Flinging ink\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 2.5 Gallery\n\n- 2.1.1 Flinging ink\n\n- 5.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 5.2 Translation notes\n\nThe Painbrush resembles a fan brush with a slit in its bristles. Its silver, metallic handle resembles a palette cup. On the handle near the bristles, the Nouveau logo can be seen, colored white. The ring separating the handle from the rest of the weapon changes color matching user's color. The handle is made of wood.\n\nThe Painbrush was revealed on 16 May 2023 in the Sizzle Season 2023 trailer[1] and was released on 1 June 2023. Its kit consists of Curling Bomb and Wave Breaker.\n\nAs a brush, when  is pressed, it rapidly flicks splashes of ink in front of the user with higher damage and longer range compared with other brushes, but as a tradeoff it possesses a long windup on the first of a series of swings and a narrower spread of ink left on surfaces with each swing. If  is held, the user will push the Painbrush along the ground, leaving a trail of ink as the user runs at a fast speed comparable to that of the Octobrush, but with a wider ink trail.\n\n- The Painbrush is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 13.1. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- Ink consumption per second while sliding is 10.8%.\n\n- While sliding, the player's movement speed is set to 0.18 units per frame.\n\n- After sliding, there is a 20 frame second cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Hitting an opponent while sliding deals 30 damage.\n\n- While sliding, the Painbrush leaves an ink trail that is 2.6 units wide.\n\n- The ink consumption of 4.8% allows players to attack 20 times before needing to refill the ink supply.\n\n- When attacking, it takes 23 frames to start swinging the brush.\n\n- The weapon can be swung every 13 frames (4.62 times per second).\n\n- When attacking while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.024 units per frame.\n\n- After swinging, there is a 50 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Attacks have a base damage of 60.\n\n- For normal attacks, ink loses damage based on distance traveled. Ink starts losing damage at 5.0 units and stops losing damage at 13.0 units. The minimum damage before time-based falloff is applied is 31.\n\n- If a glob of ink is in the air for more than 24 frames after being flung, it loses damage each frame until frame 45, at which point it will deal 50% of its original damage. Thus, the minimum damage that can be dealt per glob is is 15.5.\n\n- Damage does not change based on the angle of the ink.\n\n[2][3]\n\n- ▲ Reduced the amount of ink consumed when swinging the brush by approximately 25%: 6.4% → 4.8%.\n\n- ▲ Reduced the amount of ink consumed when holding the  Button to paint while moving ahead by approximately 25%: 14.4%/s → 10.8%/s.\n\n- ▲ Reduced the amount of time it takes for ink to begin recovering after swinging the brush by about 1/6th of a second: 60 frames → 50 frames.\n\n- ▲ The reduction in damage based on how far a shot travels before hitting an enemy has been adjusted, allowing the weapon to deal 50.0 damage/33.4 damage farther than it did before.\nMinimum swing damage: 25.0 → 31.0.\n\n- Minimum swing damage: 25.0 → 31.0.\n\n- Minimum swing damage: 25.0 → 31.0.\n\n- ▲ Increased inking width when holding  to ink while moving forward by approximately 18%: 2.2 units → 2.6 units.\n\n- ▲ Shortened the time before ink starts recovering after holding  to ink while moving forward by approximately 1/6th of a second: 30 frames → 20 frames.\n\n- ▲ Points to fill special gauge: 200 → 190.\n\n- ▲ Shortened the interval between continuous swings by approximately 1/30th of a second: 15 frames → 13 frames.\n\nIf you like brushes but wish they had a bit more range and power, then you've got to experience the Painbrush for yourself! It's all thanks to a unique 90 degree rotation by the brush head, giving this weapon the most range of ANY brush out there. The trade-off is that each swing is a bit slower, but this is still a brush we're talking about. You'll be flying across the map, and you can use Curling Bomb to blaze your path. Add in the Wave Breaker special to light up your enemies, and you've got a potent set designed for speed and extreme range!\n\nAnd here it is in action! Note how the first swing is slow, but subsequent swings fling ink fast and wide. Plus, you can hold down the  Button to advance quickly as needed. If battling is an art, this brush could be... an art tool? IDK. We're scientists, not artists.\n\n- Promotional render\n\n- 2D icon.\n\n- Holographic sticker\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Painbrush.\n\n- Japanese promotional image\n\n- The Painbrush's reveal from the trailer\n\n- Flinging ink with the Painbrush\n\n- The Painbrush showing the Nouveau logo\n\n- The top right card is for the Painbrush\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Painbrush_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nModel of the Painbrush rotating (link to file)\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Painbrush_demonstration.mp4\n\n\nThe Painbrush in action (link to file)\n\nFor competitive tips about the Painbrush\n\n- The Painbrush is not included in Return of the Mammalians due to being added post-release.\n\n- The Painbrush is the first new entry in the brush class since the original roster from Splatoon.\n\n- The Painbrush is the only brush since the original Splatoon to have the ability to splat an enemy in two hits.\n\n- Despite its metallic appearance similar to the Dynamo Roller, the Aerospray and the Nautilus, the Painbrush isn't an Ammo Knights weapon, but a Nouveau one.\n\nPainbrush is a combination of the words pain, referencing the high damage of the weapon, and brush while also being a pun on paintbrush."
