    "The Octobrush is a main weapon in the Splatoon series.",
    "Classified as a brush, when  is pressed, it flicks weak, short-ranged ink in front of the user, which can be done repeatedly at a fast rate to ink turf or splat opponents. If  is held while moving, the user pushes the Octobrush along the ground, leaving a thin trail of ink as the user runs at a fast speed.",
    "Compared to the Inkbrush, the Octobrush has a slightly wider ink trail when running and more range, damage, and painted turf with each swing than the Inkbrush at the cost of higher ink consumption and slower movement and swing speed.",
    "The Octobrush's handle is dark brown varnished wood with an antique look, with a small octopus-shaped ink reservoir carved out of it. The wood is more smooth and varnished in Splatoon 3, prior to that it is rougher and darker. The ink reservoir has a tube that changes color to match the user's ink attached to its head, leading to the bristles. The way the handle is carved gives the appearance of the octopus holding the brush's handle, while the actual handle used by the wielder is attached underneath it, and has a gold cap. Like the Inkbrush, the Octobrush has an ink splotch on the end of its bristles that changes color to match the user's ink, and disappears while the wielder is out of ink. Unlike the Inkbrush, the Octobrush's bristles are white and arranged in a flat rectangular shape.",
    "The Octobrush was released on 18 July 2015 at 02:00 UTC,[1] under the roller class. It comes in a set with Squid Beakons and the Kraken.",
    "The Octobrush has a critical damage mechanic, allowing it to sometimes splat opponents in two hits.[2] The likelihood of this can be increased by using Damage Up.",
