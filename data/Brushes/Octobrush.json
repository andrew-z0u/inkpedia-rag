  "content": "The Octobrush is a main weapon in the Splatoon series.\n\nClassified as a brush, when  is pressed, it flicks weak, short-ranged ink in front of the user, which can be done repeatedly at a fast rate to ink turf or splat opponents. If  is held while moving, the user pushes the Octobrush along the ground, leaving a thin trail of ink as the user runs at a fast speed.\n\nCompared to the Inkbrush, the Octobrush has a slightly wider ink trail when running and more range, damage, and painted turf with each swing than the Inkbrush at the cost of higher ink consumption and slower movement and swing speed.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Splatoon\n\n2.1 Data\n2.2 Version history\n2.3 Quotes\n2.4 Gallery\n2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3 Splatoon 2\n\n3.1 Data\n\n3.1.1 Flinging ink\n\n\n3.2 Version history\n3.3 Quotes\n3.4 Gallery\n3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n3.1.1 Flinging ink\n\n- 3.1.1 Flinging ink\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 4 Splatoon 3\n\n4.1 Data\n\n4.1.1 Flinging ink\n\n\n4.2 Version history\n4.3 Quotes\n4.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n4.5 Gallery\n\n- 4.1 Data\n\n4.1.1 Flinging ink\n\n- 4.1.1 Flinging ink\n\n- 4.2 Version history\n\n- 4.3 Quotes\n\n- 4.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 4.5 Gallery\n\n- 5 Strategy\n\n- 6 Trivia\n\n- 7 Etymology\n\n7.1 Names in other languages\n7.2 Translation notes\n\n- 7.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 7.2 Translation notes\n\n- 8 References\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n3.1.1 Flinging ink\n\n- 3.1.1 Flinging ink\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3.1.1 Flinging ink\n\n- 4.1 Data\n\n4.1.1 Flinging ink\n\n- 4.1.1 Flinging ink\n\n- 4.2 Version history\n\n- 4.3 Quotes\n\n- 4.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 4.5 Gallery\n\n- 4.1.1 Flinging ink\n\n- 7.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 7.2 Translation notes\n\nThe Octobrush's handle is dark brown varnished wood with an antique look, with a small octopus-shaped ink reservoir carved out of it. The wood is more smooth and varnished in Splatoon 3, prior to that it is rougher and darker. The ink reservoir has a tube that changes color to match the user's ink attached to its head, leading to the bristles. The way the handle is carved gives the appearance of the octopus holding the brush's handle, while the actual handle used by the wielder is attached underneath it, and has a gold cap. Like the Inkbrush, the Octobrush has an ink splotch on the end of its bristles that changes color to match the user's ink, and disappears while the wielder is out of ink. Unlike the Inkbrush, the Octobrush's bristles are white and arranged in a flat rectangular shape.\n\nThe Octobrush was released on 18 July 2015 at 02:00 UTC,[1] under the roller class. It comes in a set with Squid Beakons and the Kraken.\n\nThe Octobrush has a critical damage mechanic, allowing it to sometimes splat opponents in two hits.[2] The likelihood of this can be increased by using Damage Up.\n\n- The Octobrush is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- Ink consumption while rolling is 10.8% per second.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- Ink consumption per attack is 3.2%.\nThis allows players to attack 31 times before needing to refill the ink supply.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This allows players to attack 31 times before needing to refill the ink supply.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This allows players to attack 31 times before needing to refill the ink supply.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- When attacking with a depleted ink tank, ink will not be flung until enough ink has recovered.\n\n- Rolling with a depleted ink tank will not leave a trail or damage opponents.\n\n- The Octobrush can be swung every 10 frames (6 swings per second).\n\n- When rolling, the player's movement speed is set to 1.68 units per frame.\n\n- When rolling on an uninkable surface or with a depleted ink tank, the player's movement speed is set to 0.96 units per frame.\n\n- After rolling, there is a 0.33 second cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- After swinging, there is a 0.5 second cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Hitting an opponent while rolling deals 25 damage.\n\n- Attacks have a base damage of 37.\nThis weapon has a critical damage mechanic, so the damage dealt with one swing may be higher than this value.\n\n- This weapon has a critical damage mechanic, so the damage dealt with one swing may be higher than this value.\n\n- For normal attacks, ink loses damage based on distance traveled.
