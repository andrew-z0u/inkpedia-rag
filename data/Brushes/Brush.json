    "Brushes are one of the main weapon classes in the Splatoon series.",
    "Broadly similar to rollers, brushes feature the same style of swinging the weapon to flick splashes of ink and the ability to push them along the ground while moving to create a trail of ink, although they possess less ink concentration and a much thinner trail respectively.",
    "Taps of  will allow quick side-to-side flicks of a brush, spreading globs of ink in a wide radius. If  is held, the player can then proceed to push the brush in front of them while moving, creating an ink trail and dealing damage to enemies that contact the brush. Compared to rollers, all damage is considerably weaker across the board and leaves players incapable of a one-hit splat regardless of brush choice.\nInk consumption when moving while holding the  button is also different from that of rollers. Rollers consume a different amount of ink depending on the movement speed, but brushes always consume the same amount of ink, regardless of the running speed.",
    "While brushes have been in the Splatoon series since Splatoon, games prior to Splatoon 3 classified them as rollers because the two classes share a few technical characteristics. In Splatoon 3, brushes are classified as a separate weapon class.",
