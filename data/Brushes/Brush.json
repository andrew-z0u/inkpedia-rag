  "content": "Brushes are one of the main weapon classes in the Splatoon series.\n\nBroadly similar to rollers, brushes feature the same style of swinging the weapon to flick splashes of ink and the ability to push them along the ground while moving to create a trail of ink, although they possess less ink concentration and a much thinner trail respectively.\n\n- 1 General mechanics\n\n- 2 Classification\n\n- 3 List of brushes\n\n3.1 Special brushes\n\n- 3.1 Special brushes\n\n- 4 Sets\n\n- 5 Animations\n\n5.1 Splatoon\n5.2 Splatoon 2\n5.3 Splatoon 3\n\n- 5.1 Splatoon\n\n- 5.2 Splatoon 2\n\n- 5.3 Splatoon 3\n\n- 6 Quotes\n\n- 7 Gallery\n\n7.1 SplatNet icons\n7.2 2D icons\n7.3 Art\n7.4 Promotional renders for Splatoon 2\n7.5 Promotional renders for Splatoon 3\n7.6 Tableturf Battle cards for Splatoon 3\n\n- 7.1 SplatNet icons\n\n- 7.2 2D icons\n\n- 7.3 Art\n\n- 7.4 Promotional renders for Splatoon 2\n\n- 7.5 Promotional renders for Splatoon 3\n\n- 7.6 Tableturf Battle cards for Splatoon 3\n\n- 8 Trivia\n\n- 9 Names in other languages\n\n- 10 References\n\n- 3.1 Special brushes\n\n- 5.1 Splatoon\n\n- 5.2 Splatoon 2\n\n- 5.3 Splatoon 3\n\n- 7.1 SplatNet icons\n\n- 7.2 2D icons\n\n- 7.3 Art\n\n- 7.4 Promotional renders for Splatoon 2\n\n- 7.5 Promotional renders for Splatoon 3\n\n- 7.6 Tableturf Battle cards for Splatoon 3\n\nTaps of  will allow quick side-to-side flicks of a brush, spreading globs of ink in a wide radius. If  is held, the player can then proceed to push the brush in front of them while moving, creating an ink trail and dealing damage to enemies that contact the brush. Compared to rollers, all damage is considerably weaker across the board and leaves players incapable of a one-hit splat regardless of brush choice.\nInk consumption when moving while holding the  button is also different from that of rollers. Rollers consume a different amount of ink depending on the movement speed, but brushes always consume the same amount of ink, regardless of the running speed.\n\nWhile brushes have been in the Splatoon series since Splatoon, games prior to Splatoon 3 classified them as rollers because the two classes share a few technical characteristics. In Splatoon 3, brushes are classified as a separate weapon class.\n\nNote: The series are arranged by their respective order in the weapon select screen with the Main filter.\n\nThe following brushes are only available outside of battles as part of other modes:\n\nVictory:\n\n- Both genders sway their weapon side to side a few times before posing while resting the weapon on their shoulder.\n\nDefeat:\n\n- Both genders rest their weapon on their shoulder while shaking their head in disappointment.\n\nSpawning in before a match starts:\n\n- Both Inklings and Octolings hold their weapon over their shoulder.\n\nVictory:\n\n- Inkling girl: Does a few stretches while holding her weapon before positioning it behind her back.\n\n- Inkling boy: Does a \"pop-off\" while resting his weapon on his shoulder before striking a pose.\n\n- Octoling girl: Raises her weapon off the ground to rest it on her shoulder before wiping her forehead and striking a pose.\n\n- Octoling boy: Similar to the Octoling girl's, but instead ends with pointing his thumb towards his chest.\n\nDefeat:\n\n- Inklings: Hold their weapon on the ground while holding their head in disappointment, pausing to shake their head.\n\n- Octoling girl: Holds her hand up to her face, falls forward and shakes her head, before looking up while winking.\n\n- Octoling boy: Shakes his fist, kneels down and shakes his head, before looking up and winking.\n\nIn Ammo Knights (Clicking ):\n\n- Inklings: Raises their weapon up and down while looking it over, puts roller on the ground as if to start rolling, before returning to idle position.\n\n- Octolings: Holds their roller out in front of them and bounces it twice, looks weapon over from behind, raises the weapon up and brings it down into a crouched position before returning to idle.\n\nSpawner pose:\n\n- All styles: Jumps from the spawner, swings the brush and then holds it in a ready-to-battle pose.\n\nVictory:\n\n- Flip Out: Swings the weapon in full circles many times, swapping it back and forth between their hands three times, before posing with it.\n\n- Reppin' Inkopolis: The player gleefully swings their weapon from side to side, hoists it over their right shoulder, and puts their hand on their hip.\n\n- The Square Show-Off: The player holds their weapon behind their neck while gleefully facing both sides, before waving with their left arm and holding their weapon with their right.\n\nIn Ammo Knights (Clicking ):\n\n- Inklings: The player will swish their brush to angle it upwards at a roughly 45Â° angle, moving it back before making motions as if inking turf, bouncing the brush on their palm twice after.\n\n- Octolings: The player will briefly look over the brush before spinning it and pretending to paint on a wall, looking back down at the weapon and bobbing their head before going back into their idle pose.\n\n- The Inkbrush.\n\n- The Inkbrush Nouveau.\n\n- The Permanent Inkbrush.\n\n- The Octobrush.\n\n- The Octobrush Nouveau.\n\n- Inkbrush\n\n- Inkbrush Nouveau\n\n- Octobrush\n\n- Octobrush Nouveau\n\n- Cometz Octobrush\n\n- Orderbrush Replica\n\n- Painbrush\n\n- Painbrush Nouveau\n\n- Painbrush BRN-Z\n\n- A pink Inkling Girl using the Inkbrush.\n\n- Inkbrush\n\n- Inkbrush Nouveau\n\n- Octobrush\n\n- Octobrush Nouveau\n\n- Inkbrush\n\n- Inkbrush Nouveau\n\n- Permanent Inkbrush\n\n- Octobrush\n\n- Octobrush Nouveau\n\n- Kensa Octobrush\n\n- Herobrush Replica\n\n- Inkbrush\n\n- Inkbrush Nouveau\n\n- Octobrush\n\n- Octobrush Nouveau\n\n- Painbrush\n\n- Painbrush Nouveau\n\n- Inkbrush\n\n- Inkbrush Nouveau\n\n- Octobrush\n\n- Octobrush Nouveau\n\n- Painbrush\n\n- Painbrush Nouveau\n\n- Brushes are not affected by Run Speed Up while pushing them on the ground.\nHowever, brush users are affected by the ability while running, flicking, or doing both at once.\n\n- However, brush users are affected by the ability while running, flicking, or doing both at once.\n\n- Unlike rollers, brushes do not have an acceleration dash when sliding on the ground, but instead reach their maximum movement speed directly.\n\n- Brushes have the fewest weapons of any class in Splatoon (with five) and Splatoon 2 (with seven).\n\n- In Splatoon 2, brushes are the only class in which all of the members have a third variant (even though there are only two of them).\n\n- Brushes are the only weapon class from Splatoon to have no new members introduced in Splatoon 2.\n\n- However, brush users are affected by the ability while running, flicking, or doing both at once."
