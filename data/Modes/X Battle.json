    "X Battle is a multiplayer mode in Splatoon 3. It was originally announced as one of two battle modes to be added in free post-launch updates (along with League Battle) and launched on 1 December 2022 as part of the Chill Season 2022 update.[1]",
    "X Battles are similar to X Rank in Splatoon 2's Ranked Battles and use many of the same mechanics, such as X Power. However, while Splatoon 2 featured rank progression from S+ to X within the Ranked Battle game mode, Splatoon 3 offers X Battle as a separate mode from Anarchy Battles. In X Battle, players have season-long (three-month) sessions to play matches against other skilled players to increase their X Power. There are five placement matches at the beginning of the season to determine starting X Power. After placement, players take on series of matches which end after 3 wins or 3 losses, with X Power points being gained or lost at the end depending on the outcome.[2]  Players in the top 500 will also be recognized. As of update 6.0, players that have an X Power above 2000 will only play against other players with an X Power of above 2000 in X Battles.",
    "X Battles are separated into two divisions, each sponsored by a gear brand:[3][4]",
    "- Takoroka Division covers players from Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand",
    "- Tentatek Division covers players from North America, South America, and Europe",
    "Players choose their division the first time they play X Battles in a given season, and are unable to change the division until the next season.[2]",
    "As of version 6.0.0, the X power changes work according to the next table.",
    "To play X Battles, one must have a rank in Anarchy Battle of S+0 or higher. Players will need to keep this in mind with the rank reset mechanic. If a player wants to play X Battles at the beginning of the new season, they must have an Anarchy Battle Rank of S+10 or higher before the old season ends, since all ranks S+10 and above are reset to S+0 each season, while S+9 and lower are reset below the S+0 threshold. In version 8.0.0, an alternate condition was added for players who reach rank 1,000 or better on the X Battle leaderboards in any mode, granting them an Anarchy Battle rank of S+0 for the next season and maintaining their access to X Battles, regardless of the Anarchy Battle rank with which they ended the previous season.",
    "Unlike Anarchy Battle, which has a single rank for all ranked game modes, X Battle features separate rankings for each of them. X Power is tracked separately for Splat Zones, Tower Control, Rainmaker, and Clam Blitz.",
    "Call signs have been added in the version 10.0.0 update. They are names based on the players gear or hairstyle and appear during matches in X Battle instead of the actual nicknames.",
    "Locker trophies and badges are available as rewards for X Battle. The trophies are based on an in-game mode and are given to players when their final X rank standings and catalog levels are revealed.",
    "Reaching certain positions will reward the player with special badges that they can use on their Splashtag.",
    "The following pages contain the X Battle rankings of past seasons:",
    "- X Battle data/Chill Season 2022",
    "- Alternative icon with a dark blue \"X\".",
    "- SplatNet 3 icon",
    "- SplatNet 3 icon (black)",
    "- Top 500 crown",
    "- Icon used for the Top 500 list on SplatNet 3",
    "- Promotional image",
    "- Promotional image showing the  two modes available for X rank.",
    "- The two divisions for X Battle, Tentatek and Takoroka.",
    "- With the post-launch addition of X Battle joining Anarchy Battle (Series) and Anarchy Battle (Open), Splatoon 3 achieved a first for the series by making three different ranked rotations available simultaneously to solo players."
