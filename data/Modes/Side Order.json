    "Side Orderâ€‹",
    "Side Order is a single-player mode in Splatoon 3. It is the second wave of the Splatoon 3: Expansion Pass paid downloadable content. It was revealed through a teaser trailer during the February 2023 Nintendo Direct and released on 22 February 2024. The mode is designed to be highly replayable.[4][5]",
    "During the Splatoon 3 Direct on 10 August 2022, large-scale paid downloadable content involving Off the Hook was announced to arrive in a later Splatoon 3 update. A tweet was put out by Nintendo of Europe the same day reiterating Off the Hook's association with the DLC.",
    "During the 8 February 2023 Direct, Side Order was revealed as Wave 2 of the Splatoon 3: Expansion Pass, without a release date. The teaser trailer features Agent 8 in a bleached-out version of Inkopolis Square. Shortly after the Direct, some brief information about Side Order was listed on official Nintendo websites detailing the Splatoon 3: Expansion Pass.",
    "A longer gameplay trailer was shown during the 14 September 2023 Nintendo Direct, in which the Octoling player character seen in the teaser trailer was confirmed for the first time to be the Octo Expansion's Agent 8; additionally, Pearl and Acht were revealed as major supporting characters. The mode's floor progression system and Palette skill tree system were briefly demonstrated. After the trailer was shown, the Spire of Order's name was revealed, and the mode's release date was stated as Spring 2024 at the earliest.",
    "The same day as the trailer's release, an official Japanese website went online.",
    "On 21 November 2023, an online version of the 2023 winter issue of the Japanese Nintendo Magazine was made available for free; pages 42-43 of this issue cover Side Order. An English language version of the issue is also available, though its translation is noted to possibly differ from official localization choices, as the magazine is not intended for the international market.",
    "On 24 January 2024, Nintendo social media accounts posted a release date trailer for the DLC, which was shown to be 22 February 2024. It also revealed the vertical artwork for the DLC, similar to past artworks revealed for the series' other campaigns.",
    "On 13 February 2024, Nintendo posted a longer overview trailer, containing extended new gameplay footage accompanied by a voiceover. On the same day, a Fresh Season 2024 trailer was released, which included a short Side Order teaser at the end. The Japanese website was also updated.",
    "At an unknown time before the 13 February 2024 trailer's release, Nintendo invited journalists and influencers to play Side Order early at Nintendo headquarters locations in San Francisco and London for ninety minutes to two hours depending on the location. These reviewers subsequently released reviews for the mode immediately upon the overview trailer's release. Participants of the early access demo include content creators ThatSrb2DUDE,[6] Good Vibes Gaming,[7] AbdallahSmash[8] and God is a Geek,[9] as well as journalists writing for GameSpot,[10] Video Games Chronicle,[11] The Mercury News[12] and Nintendo Life.[13][14] Early reviewers claim Nintendo accommodated all travel expenses, though they were not allowed to record footage of the demo event nor share story details. Within the reviews the mode was noted as fun, difficult, and frenetic, often compared to Salmon Run Next Wave or the roguelite genre.",
    "All promotional material leading up to Side Order's release notably excluded Marina to not reveal her role in the mode's story.",
    "On 22 February 2024, Side Order was released.",
    "A teaser trailer revealing Side Order was shown in the latter half of the Splatoon 3: Expansion Pass trailer shown in the February 2023 Nintendo Direct. The teaser trailer opens with a slow pan across a dull, stark white version of Inkopolis Square from Splatoon 2, slowly focusing on Agent 8, who is wearing new gear. This altered version of Inkopolis Square features presumed dead or bleached coral; Deca Tower has been replaced with the Spire of Order. A swarm of fish-like objects \"swim\" around Agent 8 towards the end of the clip shown.",
    "Throughout the trailer, various cryptic static images and short video clips briefly flicker on-screen; the images primarily depict Agent 8 in strange bright white locations, as well as Off the Hook, while the clips seemingly depict biological components such as cells, blood, and organs.",
    "A dull, slightly out-of-tune music box melody with steady electronic percussion accompanies the teaser trailer, which slowly grows more intense; towards the end, someone can be heard speaking.",
    "A second Side Order trailer which focused on gameplay was shown in the September 2023 Nintendo Direct. The trailer opens with Agent 8 in an updated version of the dull, stark white version of Inkopolis Square alongside the Pearl Drone, a drone resembling Pearl, as the same out-of-tune music box melody featured in the first trailer plays.",
    "Agent 8 is shown descending into an unknown floor via a grappling attachment on the Pearl Drone. The Pearl Drone, Agent 8's equipment, and Jelletons are revealed, and then gameplay footage of Agent 8 in combat with Jelletons is shown. The Jelletons are seen spawning from portals.",
    "Cutscene footage of Agent 8 and Pearl encountering Acht in an elevator is then shown; within it, Acht introduces themself as an old friend of Marina's. The floor selection and Palette screens are shown, then Agent 8 enters the Exposed Winding floor, which is not in final game. Gameplay footage of several different floors is shown in quick succession, then the trailer abruptly cuts to a clip of Agent 8's octopus ghost entering a crystalized shell resembling their form, respawning into a floor. After a cut to black, Agent 8 is shown running in slow motion alongside the Pearl Drone towards Asynchronous Rondo. After another cut to black, the mode's title is shown with glitch and black coral effects.",
    "Throughout the trailer, various scenes depict the Spire of Order's floors seemingly spontaneously generating with a Matrix-style code effect. Many floors shown appear to have blocky, black holes in their walls reminiscent of a greeble effect. Additionally, armor pickups and canned specials can be spotted within certain floors.",
    "Agent 8's ink color is significantly paler compared to the previous trailer; their ink color tint appears to change between clips, being affected by different color chips. Their gear appears at various stages of upgrade throughout the trailer; the seemingly well-upgraded version includes thin, bright, hologram-like extensions on their dualies, as well as an eyepiece similar to the See-an-Enemy HUD.",
    "The trailer opens with the same musical box tune heard in the teaser trailer, then cuts to a slow-paced electronic glitch song with prominent industrial percussion called rout1nes. Midway, the song swaps for a more intense electronic song, that being demoli2h. Then at the end, the music transitions into a slow, echoed version of Spectrum Obligato.",
    "A third Side Order trailer revealing the mode's release date as well as new key artwork was posted to Twitter and YouTube on 24 January 2024.",
    "The trailer opens with the train cutscene seen in Splatoon 3's tutorial; the player's character is instead listening to Muck Warfare (rather than Anarchy Rainbow) alongside a sleeping Smallfry and other passengers. As the player dozes off, the music becomes more and more distorted, accompanied by glitch effects. The yellow Matrix-style code seen in the second trailer slowly fills the screen.",
    "The scene cuts to what is presumably Agent 8's point of view upon waking in the Order Sector version of Inkopolis Square. Pearl calls out to wake them, as the Square is seemingly generated on the spot by the yellow code effect. The glitch effects seen in the previous scene intermittently appear. The music box theme from the previous trailers plays as someone can be heard speaking, similar to the first trailer's ending.",
    "The trailer then cuts to the campaign's key artwork, which unfolds from the upper section, gradually descending to the lower portion: at the zenith, Marina and Pearl (in her Inkling form) are displayed, alongside Parallel Canon. The middle segment showcases Jelletons circling Asynchronous Rondo, with Pinging Marciale directly below it, as well as Acht and Cipher. The lower segment highlights Agent 8 and the Pearl Drone. During the descent, the 22 February 2024 release date slowly fades in.",
    "A fourth Side Order trailer showing an overview of the gameplay was posted to Twitter[15] and YouTube on 13 February 2024.",
    "The trailer features a voiceover explaining the mode's basic gameplay loop, which consists of floor selection, color chip enhancement, and objective completion.",
    "New floor objective types, Jelleton types, bosses, color chips, and available weapons were revealed in this trailer. Additionally, the Membux and Prlz currencies were introduced.",
    "At the end of the trailer, various footage of Side Order gameplay and cutscenes is shown, along with the announcement of replica gear and main weapons that can be used in multiplayer battles.",
    "A brief teaser for Side Order was shown after the fake-out ending in the Fresh Season 2024 trailer posted to Twitter[16] and YouTube.",
    "The teaser is a fast-paced montage of new floor and boss gameplay footage, cutscenes, close-ups of stage details, and a brief look at a customization screen for Agent 8. Most notably, it briefly shows Pearl in her regular Inkling form speaking, as well as Acht at their DJ table.",
    "Agent 8 has been unexpectedly transported to the Order Sector, a mysterious world that is built out of its own unique rules.[17] Agent 8 wakes up to find what appears to be Inkopolis Square, suddenly drained of color and uninhabited.[5] They are challenged to ascend the Spire of Order, a tower that changes floor structure each time it is entered, which has mysteriously replaced Deca Tower, as \"something wants to make the entire world orderly\".[13] Pearl, having been transformed into[17] a drone called the Pearl Drone, accompanies Agent 8 and assists them in combat.",
    "Acht, also known as Dedf1sh, has \"wandered into\" the Order Sector,[17] and appears to travel between floors alongside Agent 8 inside an elevator within the Spire of Order.",
    "After reaching the Spire's Control Room, Agent 8 encounters Marina, who has been mind-controlled through a Controller VM and wired into a large tentacle blob as Marina Agitando. Agent 8 destroys the tentacle blob, freeing Marina, before Agent 8 and Pearl are confronted by a being calling itself Order. They are booted out of the Spire after it declares its goal to establish a world of pure order. When they end up back in the Order Sector, Order fully reconfigures the Spire, and Marina reveals that the Sector is part of a prototype virtual reality system she designed called the Project Memverse, which was originally intended to reverse the sanitizing process. After Order seized control of the Memverse, it began forcibly connecting people to the system by Grayscaling them to begin building a world of perfect order where independent thought does not exist. By Grayscaling its victims, it will eventually be able to impose its ideal world upon reality.",
    "Agent 8 re-enters the Spire, albeit with Marina supporting them from the elevator while providing them with Marina's Hacks. While they ascend the Spire accompanied by Off the Hook and Acht, they encounter tons of hostile Jelletons, at least 30 floors, and at least two bosses as they ascend back up to the Control Room, where they confront Order. Marina tries to explain to Order why its idea of a perfect world is dysfunctional, however, Order malfunctions over the concept of its creator denying it before it decides that Agent 8 must be destroyed, enters a grate in the floor, and reappears as the Magistrate of Order, Overlorder. Agent 8 battles the Overlorder in three phases while playing New World Order, but it survives, and activates a program that activates a mass Grayscaling, knocking out Agent 8.",
    "The player \"brings back the beat\" in a small rhythm minigame, and wakes up Agent 8. Marina and Acht, in an act of resistance to Overlorder, start playing Spectrum Obligato ~ Ebb & Flow (Out of Order). Pearl declares that the \"show don't stop\" and lets out an immensely powerful \"Booyah!\" that destroys the Control Room. Agent 8 throws themselves into a battle against the Overlorder but they find out that Overlorder emptied their Palette and placed the color chips inside some portals. They destroy the portals and grab the chips, which are revealed to be oversaturated, causing their effects to be heavily amplified. As Overlorder's barrier is destroyed, Pearl activates a Color Wail using the chips and fires it at Overlorder, causing it to malfunction and implode as a result of color overload.",
    "After the destruction of the Overlorder, a tiny octopus form of a heavily damaged and restricted Order named Smollusk appears and gets upset that Agent 8 \"wuined[sic] [its] perfect world of order.\" Pearl and Marina jokingly declare that \"there's not much to worry about here,\" and leave with Agent 8 and Acht on an elevator that appears in the middle of the Control Room, as the credits roll.",
    "After the defeat of the Overlorder, Agent 8 returns back to the Memverse, where Off the Hook greets them and Marina explains that Agent 8's work is not done yet. She explains that the Palettes are the souls of those that were Grayscaled and that Agent 8 must set them free. To set a Palette's soul free, Agent 8 needs to re-ascend the Spire and reach the now-destroyed Control Room for the Palette to be manually reconfigured, which Agent 8 has to do with all the Palettes to set every soul free. Smollusk is not on board with Marina's plan to free the souls, and actively tries to prevent Agent 8 from reaching the Control Room and reconfiguring the Palettes. Every time Agent 8 gets to the top of the Spire, Smollusk transforms into Overlorder to try and stop Agent 8 as the final boss of the run. Agent 8 scales the Spire and defeats Smollusk ten more times to free the souls, obtaining every reward in the lockers including all Marina's Dev Diary entries, until they receive their own Palette. Meanwhile, they meet Cipher, a lucifer shrimp that runs a stall located in the Order Sector called Cipher's Siftings[18].",
    "Once they have obtained their Palette, Agent 8 re-ascends the Spire and defeats Smollusk for the last time to reconfigure it. Agent 8's Palette has the special properties of being able to skip floors using Membux (except for boss floors), while the number of active hacks decreases the maximum number of chips in their Palette. During the last ride up the Spire, Agent 8 also receives three additional entries for Marina's Dev Diary, which are letters from Acht to Marina.",
    "Although Eight reconfigured all the Palettes, they can still scale to the Spire to \"pway\"[sic] with Smollusk again with no limits.",
    "The mode's missions take place in the Spire of Order's many different floors; the Spire contains thirty floors total, where a boss is encountered every ten floors.[10] Players can unlock different main weapons, which are assigned to individual Palettes. Palettes are unlocked by obtaining keys dropped by bosses on the 10th, 20th, and 30th floors, and using them to open the Lockers in the Memverse version of Inkopolis Square.",
    "While the Locker cubbies containing Palettes are set (which are indicated by pulsing rings around them), the exact contents are randomized, so individual players may unlock specific Palettes earlier or later than others (except for Eight's Palette, which will always be found in the final locker).",
    "Before each floor begins, the player may select one of three objectives to complete; harder objectives yield greater rewards. After selecting a floor, the player is given color chips. The color chips provide many different enhancements, some of which are similar to gear abilities, like Ink Saver (Main) or Run Speed Up. By default, the Pearl Drone can scout sight enemies, glide with Agent 8, and activate the Step-Off Song after collecting three Disc pieces. All of her other abilities are unlockable,[10] which means her aid will be limited without the collection of Drone-tone color chips.",
    "Clearing floors rewards the player with Membux, which can be used as a currency on floors containing vending machines.[13] However, if the player loses all their lives, they will lose all their color chips and must restart from the first Floor. When this happens, the accumulated Color chips and Membux will be converted into Prlz, which can be used to buy permanent upgrades via Marina in the Square[8] that will subsequently apply to all future runs through the Spire.",
    "Permanent upgrades can be purchased with Prlz via Marina hacking them into effect and will aid the player in reaching the top of the Spire.",
    "Each Palette (excluding Eight's Palette) can unlock up to three  keys used to unlock various rewards by using them on the lockers located near the entrance of the Spire of Order.",
    "Side Order's level system consists of individual floors within the Spire of Order, which are randomly selected in subsequent runs after the first climb.",
    "Throughout Side Order, it is possible to unlock replicas of the weapons and gear used throughout the mode.",
    "Additionally, clearing Side Order for the first time unlocks Inkopolis Square for the player character to traverse to.",
    "Badges can be obtained by completing certain objectives in Side Order. An example is the color chip badges, which can be obtained by collecting the data for all of the color chips of the same tone. A list of badges from Side Order and how to obtain them can be found below.",
    "Unique chips (unstackable) only need to be acquired once.",
    "The Lockers, located in plain sight of spawning distance, hold various rewards, used both within Side Order and in multiplayer.",
    "Within the Lockers are Palettes which are weapon sets to be used to climb the Spire of Order, entries of Marina's Dev Diary which serve as the Sunken Scrolls of Side Order with each entries' backgrounds becoming locker stickers once read, Prlz to spend on Marina's hacks or Cipher's wares, and even Splashtag banners.",
    "To access the Lockers, players need keys, which can only be earned by defeating the bosses found on the 10th, 20th, and 30th floors for the first time with any given weapon (barring Eight's Palette, which instead gives the final three Dev Diary entries). Completing a run with any given Palette unlocks replica versions of that weapon for multiplayer battle usage.",
    "Cipher's Siftings is a shop found within the Order Sector run by the enigmatic Cipher, located in the corner where the Tableturf Battle Dojo is located in the actual Inkopolis Square.",
    "Items available for purchase in the store include locker decorations, locker stickers, Splashtag banners, and gear in exchange for Prlz.[19]",
    "Cipher only appears after clearing Side Order for the first time. Additionally, Cipher's wares expand for every three locker keys that Agent 8 collects, with its full selection unlocked with all thirty-six keys.",
    "Located around Cipher's Siftings are what appear to be individual parts of a Marching Andante.",
    "After purchasing all available items, players can use Â 100 once per day to receive one of the following rewards from the terminal:[20]",
    "Receiving decorations via this method is the only way to receive duplicates of decorations obtained in Side Order. A total of Â 4,042 Prlz must be spent to unlock this function. Unlike with the Shel-drone, players will only start receiving refunds of Â 2,000 for locker figurines and stickers when they obtained the maximum number for each.",
    "Some of Side Order's music is based on or made by Off the Hook, as they are major characters in the DLC. Songs like Spectrum Obligato ~ Ebb & Flow (Out of Order) and Short Order show a heavy emphasis on the duo. Marina also produces a new solo song called Unconscience, played during the Marina Agitando boss battle.",
    "In addition, Acht (a.k.a. Dedf1sh) has a heavy musical influence, with some of their songs from Octo Expansion influencing songs in Side Order, like #0.1 style being a remix of #0 shell and #12.2 awakened being a remix of #12 awake.",
    "Much of the music in the mode is made by a group called Free Association and is used in floors. For normal levels, different songs play based on the objective of the level and area of the floor within the spire. Songs can be grouped by objective, using different names (\"demolish\", \"jesting\", \"routines\", \"souvenir\", and \"jitters\"), or by area, using numbers to replace letters in the titles (either a 1, 2, or 3), reflecting intensity. How numbers are inserted is like that of leetspeak, tying into the Memverse's themes of technology and internet culture. Songs using a 1 play in the first ten floors of the spire, songs using a 2 play in the second ten, and songs using a 3 play in the last ten. Each of the five groups of music has their own style and instruments.",
    "Different music plays on boss floors, also made by Free Association.",
    "A side order is another term for a side dish, a food item meant to accompany a larger main item as part of a meal. The title is a pun on the mode being a side story about Team Order, the Splatfest team led by Marina that lost the Final Fest in Splatoon 2.",

    "- Songs using \"demolish\" in the title (demol1sh, demoli2h, and d3molish) play on floors with the \"Destroy the portal!\" objective. These songs have very heavy, strong bass parts and are generally accompanied by synth background melodies. They keep a steady pulse as well.",
    "- Songs using \"jesting\" in the title (jest1ng, je2ting, and j3sting) play on floors with the \"Defeat the fleeing foe!\" objective. These songs mainly feature several fast groupings of notes, usually happening at the same time. The notes are very unpredictable, and each song features various sudden rhythmic and melodic changes. This may allude to the unpredictability of the Panicking Alla Mambo, the enemy Agent 8 must chase on these floors.",
    "- Songs using \"routines\" in the title (rout1nes, routine2, and routin3s) play on floors with the \"Protect the zone!\" objective. These songs are generally characterized by heavy layers of percussion and rhythmic lines, as well as various background melodies from synths. These songs also feature a sound effect which resembles a piece of metal clanging into an object.",
    "- Songs using \"souvenir\" in the title (souven1r, 2ouvenir, and souv3nir) play on floors with the \"Sink the âˆž-ball!\" objective. These songs are often the simplest of the five types and normally feature very airy and light melodies and layers. Nostalgic-sounding chords play in the background, while mellowed synths play a simple melody. Every so often, the track suddenly changes to a small, differing clip of music from what was previously played, then returns to the original melody. This may be meant to resemble a memory or flashback, alluding to either the name of the song (\"souvenir\" meaning \"to remember\" in French), to the Memverse and Marina's project to restore memories, or Agent 8's memories of 8-balls from the Octo Expansion, which are similar to âˆž-balls.",
    "- Songs using \"jitters\" in the title (j1tters, jitter2, and jitt3rs) play on floors with the \"Escort the turbine tower!\" objective. These songs feature short and frenzied piano excerpts, played at seemingly random times in the piece. The songs also feature dissonant background melodies and melodic elements.
