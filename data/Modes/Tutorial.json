Players can throw a bomb at the crate to blow them up or take down the crates one by one. The player is then told they can press  repeatedly to swim up walls faster. They can then ink up one side of the wall and climb up it. The next and final three balloons sit on top of the wall, ahead up the ramp, and ahead up another ramp on the left.
