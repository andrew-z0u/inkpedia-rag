They can be played solo or with a team, and feature two-hour ranked play windows similar to League Battle, but unlike League Battle's constant rotations, the windows only occur at a few specific times during a season. Winning five games in a Challenge awards the player with a Shell-Out Token.\nThe monthly event battles that appeared in Splatoon 2's League Battle returned as Monthly Challenges. Just like Anarchy Battles, Challenges unlock when a player reaches Level 10.\n\nAs of version 10.1.0, there are 33 known challenge modes, with one upcoming new mode. Challenges usually occur once per week, with the Monthly Challenge occurring once per month. The New Season Challenge occurred at the start of each season until Sizzle Season 2024.\n\nAll timeframes per Challenge feature a list of the Top 100 Teams, Duos, and Solo players respectively.\n\nList of rankings:\n\n- Challenge/Top 100 (Sizzle Season 2023)\n\n- Challenge/Top 100 (Drizzle Season 2023)\n\n- Challenge/Top 100 (Chill Season 2023)\n\n- Challenge/Top 100 (Fresh Season 2024)\n\n- Challenge/Top 100 (Sizzle Season 2024)\n\n- Challenge/Top 100 (Drizzle Season 2024)\n\nAfter a special Challenge has concluded, social media channels of three regions will generally announce the teams that placed first, second, and third with the highest Challenge Power for a certain timeslot. They will also announce the team with the middle-ranking among all teams as the Average Roe award. The announcement is accompanied by in-game screenshots of the teams posing on the stages that were available for the Challenge.\n\nThe special Challenges that have gotten these announcements are New Season Challenge and Monthly Challenge. To be eligible for announcements on social media, participants have to join and play as a group of 3 to 4 players where half or more have set their Splatfest region to one that matches one of the social media channels.\n\n- SplatoonNA (The Americas)\n\n- Nintendo UK VS (Europe)\n\n- SplatoonJP (Japan)\n\nA \"3 Challenges in a row\" Monthly Challenge[2] is a rerun of past Challenges with largely the same stages and modes scheduled for three consecutive days.
