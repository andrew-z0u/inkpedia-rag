    "Challenge mode is an event mode which was added in Sizzle Season 2023. Officially a replacement for Splatoon 2's League Battle,[1] Challenges are limited-time competitions of standard modes with unique in-match conditions. They can be played solo or with a team, and feature a two-hour ranked play window similar to League Battle, but unlike League Battle's constant rotations, the windows only occur at a few specific times during a season. Winning five games in a Challenge awards the player with a Shell-Out Token.",
