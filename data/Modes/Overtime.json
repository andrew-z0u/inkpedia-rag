    "Overtime(NA), or Extra Time in Splatoon(EU/OC), refers to a period right after the main timer reaches 0 in Ranked Battles, in which the losing team is given a final chance to win. The conditions in which Overtime begins vary between modes, but they generally revolve around the losing team having some sort of control over the main objective when regulation ends.",
    "Before a match of Ranked Battles starts, one team is assigned as team Alpha and the other is assigned as team Bravo. In the event that neither team is able to score points before time runs out, the win will be given to team Alpha as a 1-0 victory without starting Overtime. An exception to this is Clam Blitz games, in which a special 3-minute Overtime starts. The first team to score in this Overtime wins with a 20-0 victory, since it can be scored only by Power Clam, which is worth 20 points, if barrier is closed. If no player manages to score within these five minutes, the win is given to the team that created the most Power Clams. If both teams created the same amount of Power Clams, the win is given to team Alpha as a 1-0 victory.",
    "In Splat Zones, Overtime begins if the losing team (the team with a higher timer count[a]):",
    "- has full control of all zones",
    "- lost control less than ten seconds before the end of regulation and the zone has not been retaken by the winning team",
    "Overtime ends when:",
    "- The losing team lowers their timer below the winning team's timer, thereby giving the losing team the victory.",
    "- The losing team loses control of a Splat Zone (i.e. the Splat Zone was neutralized), and cannot regain control within ten seconds.\nOn maps where there are two Splat Zones, the winning team needs to neutralize (or capture) at least one zone for ten seconds to win the match.",
    "- The winning team retakes control of the Splat Zone.\nOn maps where there are two Splat Zones, the winning team has to take both of the Splat Zones in order to end the match immediately.",
    "In Tower Control, Overtime begins if the losing team (with a shorter distance traveled[b]) currently has control of the Tower. At this point, Overtime ends when:",
    "- The losing team rides the tower to a farther distance than the winning team, giving them the victory.",
    "- The winning team regains control of the Tower.\nThe number of players from the winning team on the tower must outnumber the players from the losing team on the tower.",
    "- The losing team loses control of the Tower.\nThis is marked by the indicator turning from the losing team's color to the neutral Ranked Battle symbol and happens five seconds after all players leave the Tower.",
    "In Rainmaker, Overtime begins when:",
    "- The latest carrier, who is on the winning team (the team with the farthest distance traveled), gets splatted less than fifteen seconds before the end of regulation.\nNote that the carrier getting splatted right after breaking through the checkpoint does not trigger this scenario.",
    "- The losing team is in control of the Rainmaker.",
    "- (in Splatoon 3) The latest carrier, who is on the losing team, breaks through the checkpoint less than a few seconds before the end of regulation.",
    "- The winning team regains control of the Rainmaker.",
    "- The losing team fails to pick up the Rainmaker 10 seconds after:\nOvertime commences.\n(in Splatoon 3) The losing team breaks through the checkpoint.",
    "- The carrier on the losing team gets splatted.\nNote that the carrier getting splatted right after breaking through the checkpoint does not trigger this scenario.",
    "- The losing team carries the Rainmaker past the winning team's score, giving them the victory.",
    "Other info:",
    "- The status of the Rainmaker shield (popped or not) does not matter.",
    "In Clam Blitz, when time runs out and at least one team has scored, Overtime begins when either:",
    "- The losing team has a Power Clam in their possession, or on the field that has not yet disappeared.[c]",
    "- The winning team's barrier is open.",
    "- The losing team's barrier is open but they were winning when it was opened.",
    "- The winning team's barrier closes.",
    "- The winning team scores.",
    "- The losing team loses all of their Power Clams before opening the winning team's barrier.",
    "- The losing team fails to open the winning team's barrier within twenty seconds.",
    "- The losing team takes the lead, therefore giving them the victory.",
    "If time runs out and neither team has scored, special Overtime begins. In this case, Overtime ends when either:",
    "- One team manages to score, giving them a 20-0 victory.",
    "- Five minutes of Overtime pass, after which the team that formed the most Power Clams throughout the match is awarded one point and a 1-0 victory. If both teams formed the exact same number of Power Clams, Team Alpha is awarded the victory.",
    "- There is an alarm like sound during Overtime if a team has control over the objective but does not have the lead. This acts as a warning for the team with the lead to try to prevent a loss.",
    "- In Splatoon 3, when Overtime is triggered, the black box behind the word \"Overtime!\" changes color to match the losing team's ink color. As time passes, the color will gradually drain from the box, serving as a visual indicator of how much time the losing team has left to either take the lead or in some cases regain full control over the objective before Overtime ends.\nIn Clam Blitz's special Overtime, box color changes to Team Bravo's ink color (i.e. The team be losing in the event of a complete tie, which includes the tie of the number of Power Clams formed.)"
