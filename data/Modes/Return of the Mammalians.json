It involves the player donning a Hero Suit and venturing into the Crater to defeat the Octarian army (which is now covered in hair), soon ending up in Alterna.\n\n- 1 Story\n\n- 2 Gameplay\n\n2.1 Mechanics\n\n- 2.1 Mechanics\n\n- 3 Missions\n\n- 4 Characters\n\n- 5 Enemies\n\n5.1 Regular enemies\n5.2 Bosses\n\n- 5.1 Regular enemies\n\n- 5.2 Bosses\n\n- 6 Quotes\n\n- 7 Badges\n\n- 8 Music\n\n- 9 Gallery\n\n9.1 Artwork\n9.2 Promotional images\n9.3 Other\n9.4 Screenshots\n\n- 9.1 Artwork\n\n- 9.2 Promotional images\n\n- 9.3 Other\n\n- 9.4 Screenshots\n\n- 10 Similarities with Octo Expansion\n\n10.1 Story mode progression\n10.2 Final stage\n\n10.2.1 Return of the Mammalians\n10.2.2 Octo Expansion\n\n\n10.3 Final stage bosses\n\n10.3.1 Return of the Mammalians\n10.3.2 Octo Expansion\n\n- 10.1 Story mode progression\n\n- 10.2 Final stage\n\n10.2.1 Return of the Mammalians\n10.2.2 Octo Expansion\n\n- 10.2.1 Return of the Mammalians\n\n- 10.2.2 Octo Expansion\n\n- 10.3 Final stage bosses\n\n10.3.1 Return of the Mammalians\n10.3.2 Octo Expansion\n\n- 10.3.1 Return of the Mammalians\n\n- 10.3.2 Octo Expansion\n\n- 11 Changes after completing the mode\n\n- 12 Trivia\n\n- 13 Names in other languages\n\n- 14 References\n\n- 15 External links\n\n- 2.1 Mechanics\n\n- 5.1 Regular enemies\n\n- 5.2 Bosses\n\n- 9.1 Artwork\n\n- 9.2 Promotional images\n\n- 9.3 Other\n\n- 9.4 Screenshots\n\n- 10.1 Story mode progression\n\n- 10.2 Final stage\n\n10.2.1 Return of the Mammalians\n10.2.2 Octo Expansion\n\n- 10.2.1 Return of the Mammalians\n\n- 10.2.2 Octo Expansion\n\n- 10.3 Final stage bosses\n\n10.3.1 Return of the Mammalians\n10.3.2 Octo Expansion\n\n- 10.3.1 Return of the Mammalians\n\n- 10.3.2 Octo Expansion\n\n- 10.2.1 Return of the Mammalians\n\n- 10.2.2 Octo Expansion\n\n- 10.3.1 Return of the Mammalians\n\n- 10.3.2 Octo Expansion\n\nAn Inkling or Octoling and their buddy Smallfry arrive in Splatsville, where Shiver, Frye, and Big Man of Deep Cut report in a special Anarchy Splatcast broadcast that the Great Zapfish that powers the city has gone missing. The Inkling or Octoling goes through a manhole leading to the Crater, where they meet Craig Cuttlefish. He recruits them as the new Agent 3 of the New Squidbeak Splatoon and gives them a Hero Suit, enlisting them to rescue the Great Zapfish from the Octarians, who stole it twice before.\n\nAgent 3 progresses through the Crater, rescuing Zapfish from the Octarians and clearing away Fuzzy Ooze by powering up Smallfry with Power Eggs. Along the way, Cuttlefish notices that the Octarians are now fuzzy and tries to contact Agent 1 and Agent 2 to provide backup. DJ Octavio intervenes in the communication, but Cuttlefish dismisses it as his radio being broken.\n\nWhen Agent 3 reaches the center of the Crater, DJ Octavio appears in his battle mech, the Octobot King L3.Gs, and accuses Cuttlefish of being behind the disappearance of his Octarian troops. After Agent 3 defeats him in battle, Cuttlefish taunts him for being easy to defeat, as though he was not using the Great Zapfish's power. However, Octavio then reveals that he did not steal the Great Zapfish this time, to Cuttlefish's shock. Suddenly, the ground beneath them collapses as Fuzzy Ooze flows out. A tentacle-shaped piece of Fuzzy Ooze takes Cuttlefish away from Agent 3, who loses their Hero Suit and Power Eggs in the fall. Meanwhile, Deep Cut watches from above.\n\nAgent 3 wakes up in the mysterious location of Alterna, where they are greeted by the New Squidbeak Splatoon, comprised of the Squid Sisters (Agents 1 and 2) and the Captain (the former Agent 3). They explain to Agent 3 that Alterna, which is also full of Fuzzy Ooze, consists of six sites, as well as a large rocket. Three of the sites are emitting strong signals that they suspect come from a tracking device they placed on Cuttlefish. Agent 3 is tasked with investigating these three areas in order to find Cuttlefish.\n\nAgent 3 progresses through Alterna, continuing to remove Fuzzy Ooze along the way. In order to get enough Power Eggs to do this, they complete missions set by an AI known as O.R.C.A.\n\nAs Agent 3 reaches the end of the first site, Future Utopia Island, Deep Cut suddenly appears. The three of them introduce themselves, revealing that they are actually bandits and declaring that the Splatlands are their turf and all the treasure in Alterna belongs to them, before departing.\n\nAgent 3 visits each of the three locations that are emitting signals. Each time, they encounter one of the three members of Deep Cut and defeat them in battle, only to find that the signal was coming from the treasure they were guarding, which Agent 3 takes. After the first treasure is collected, Cuttlefish manages to make contact with Agents 1 and 2 and reveals that he is locked in a dark room. After the second treasure is collected, he briefly makes contact again, until he is confronted by his unseen captor, Mr. Grizz. After the third treasure is collected, Cuttlefish makes contact again and deduces from his aching knee that he is high up before Mr. Grizz cuts him off.\n\nAgents 1 and 2 deduce that Cuttlefish is in the rocket, which they cannot reach due to the Fuzzy Ooze surrounding it. They assemble the treasures into a large tool, which the Captain uses to remove the Fuzzy Ooze, allowing the team to proceed to the Alterna Space Center, though the Captain ends up hurt from using the tool. Soon after this, Deep Cut appears again, trying to take back the treasure, but to their surprise, Agent 2 agrees to let them have it. Regretting their hostility, Deep Cut apologize and ask Agent 2 to be their boss, who reluctantly accepts.\n\nAgent 3 makes their way up the rocket. On their way, they overhear Mr. Grizz talking to Cuttlefish about his plans to use Golden Eggs (collected by his unwitting employees at Grizzco Industries) to \"restore the balance of the world\". Agent 1 also asks Deep Cut about their reason for hunting treasures, and they explain that they sell the treasure to help those in need in Splatsville while leaving little for themselves, which makes Agents 1 and 2 respect them. Agent 3 also passes by the Great Zapfish trapped in a container in the rocket.\n\nAs Agent 3 nears the top of the rocket, they overhear Mr. Grizz attacking Cuttlefish, claiming his brain contains the \"beautiful essence\" he needs. At the top, Agents 1, 2 and 3 find Cuttlefish dried up and lifeless as a result of being dehydrated by Mr. Grizz, who finally confronts them, revealing him to be a grizzly bear. The Captain arrives, and soon afterwards Mr. Grizz escapes on the rocket as it takes off, announcing his intention to spread Fuzzy Ooze all over the planet and bring forth a new era of mammalian dominance.\n\nThe Captain sheds a tear on Cuttlefish's body, which moistens him enough to awaken him, albeit still with his dried-up appearance. Deep Cut helps Agent 3 and Smallfry reach the rocket in space, where they fight Mr. Grizz. After having the Fuzzballs on his body splatted, Mr. Grizz knocks Agent 3 and Smallfry off of the rocket as he absorbs the Fuzzy Ooze and plans to unleash it on Earth himself. However, DJ Octavio flies in with his Octobot King to save them, wanting to help stop Mr. Grizz's plan. He, the Squid Sisters, and Deep Cut then perform Calamari Inkantation 3MIX together, and Smallfry becomes Hugefry. In the final battle, Hugefry fights Mr. Grizz as DJ Octavio and Agent 3 vacuum the Fuzzballs on his body. After vacuuming all of the Fuzzballs, they fire the fuzz back at him, defeating him in a large explosion. Smallfry returns to normal and joins DJ Octavio and Agent 3 as they return to Earth.\n\nIn an Anarchy Splatcast broadcast, Deep Cut reports that the Great Zapfish has returned to Splatsville and that the Squid Sisters have released a new single, Wave Goodbye. After realizing that Agents 1 and 2 are in fact the Squid Sisters, they set aside their disdain for the Squid Sisters and play the song. When Agent 3 returns to Alterna, they are congratulated by Agents 1 and 2, Cuttlefish, and the Captain for saving the world.\n\nCompared to the Hero Mode of the previous two games, Return of the Mammalians has a less linear progression similar to the Octo Expansion. When the player enters a mission, O.R.C.A. explains the premise of the level with dialogue and prompts the player to select one of the sets of weapons available. Different sets of weapons may have different Power Eggs rewards. Some missions also cost Power Eggs to play, and/or have special conditions that will cause the player to get splatted if they fail.\n\nThe areas in this mode are covered in Fuzzy Ooze, which serves as the obstacle blocking the path to other areas, rather than having the missions locked themselves. The player needs to use the Power Eggs they collect from the missions to clear them and progress.\n\nThe map screen in each of the sites tracks how many of each type of item the player has found on the overworld (loot anchors that contain decorations, golden records, Sardinium, and Sunken Scrolls). The map highlights areas with unobtained items to find in green, labeled as Areas of Interest, whereas it marks areas which the player has not been to yet with black striped squares labeled Parts Unknown. If the player fully collects all items in a site and goes to every possible part of the map so that there are no longer any black squares, the site becomes marked as \"Surveyed\". Marie will award the player with a piece of the map of Alterna as a sticker if they survey that site.\n\nFully surveying all sites causes a Shel-drone to appear. Each day the player can charge this drone by using 999 power eggs. The following day, the drone will send an item to the lobby terminal. These items include cash, ability chunks, and meal tickets, as well as decorations that can only be found in Alterna. This is currently the only way to get duplicates of these decorations. If the Shel-drone does not appear after the player surveys every area, they will need to go back to Splatsville, and then Alterna again.\n\nPrologue: The Crater\n\nNo. 1 Octarians in the Crater?

So you can sharpen your skills AND take advantage of a weapon's particular strengths to survive. That said, sometimes you'll have nothing to rely on but your wits... and maybe a Zipcaster.\n\nCompleting certain objectives in Return of the Mammalians rewards the player with badges that they can use on their Splashtag.\n\nOctoplush\n\nOctoplush\n\n- Mode icon\n\n- Logo\n\n- Key art (vertical)\n\n- Transparent version\n\n- Key art (horizontal, no logo)\n\n- Agent 3 and Smallfry\n\n- Agent 3\n\n- Agent 3\n\n- Agent 3\n\n- Smallfry and Power Eggs\n\n- Smallfry\n\n- Smallfry\n\n- Smallfry\n\n- New Squidbeak Splatoon (Callie, the Captain, and Marie)\n\n- New Squidbeak Splatoon - Holidays 2021\n\n- New Squidbeak Splatoon\n\n- Craig Cuttlefish\n\n- Craig Cuttlefish\n\n- Octotrooper\n\n- Icon for bosses\n\n- Agent 3 with the first style of the Hero Suit\n\n- Agent 3 with the second style of the Hero Suit\n\n- An Octotrooper\n\n- A view of Alterna, as seen in the opening\n\n- Agent 3 and Smallfry near some of the Fuzzy Ooze\n\n- Agent 3, immediately after touching the Fuzzy Ooze\n\n- Agent 3, fully trapped in Fuzzy Ooze\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Smallfry_consuming_Fuzzy_Ooze.mp4\n\n\nSmallfry eating some Fuzzy Ooze via a Fuzzball (link to file)\n\n- Callie, Marie, and the Captain\n\n- An Octarian and Smallfry\n\n- Cuttlefish, as seen in Splatoon 3\n\n- Octostamps and an Amped Octostamp in Return of the Mammalians\n\n- A group of Octohoppers\n\n- A group of Octopods with an Oversized Octopod\n\n- A group of Octarians\n\n- Enemy Octolings\n\n- A world map taken from the Earth's model as seen in the final boss\n\n- An image of Agent 3 wielding a Sloshing Machine, with Smallfry in the back.\n\n- Agent 3 battling an Octarian with the Splatana Stamper.\n\nReturn of the Mammalians bears multiple similarities to Octo Expansion.\n\n- The player can use non-Hero weapons, and most missions give the player a choice of which weapon to use.\n\n- Both modes have a similar interface, a variety of mission conditions and heightened freedom as opposed to the previous two story modes' linear progression.\n\n- Both modes have a form of currency\nReturn of the Mammalians has Power Eggs.\nOcto Expansion has CQ Points.\nUse of in-game currency is required to unlock or attempt missions, progressing the campaign.\nIn Return of the Mammalians, Power Eggs are also used to clear Fuzzy Ooze that blocks the way.\n\n- Return of the Mammalians has Power Eggs.\n\n- Octo Expansion has CQ Points.\n\n- Use of in-game currency is required to unlock or attempt missions, progressing the campaign.\n\n- In Return of the Mammalians, Power Eggs are also used to clear Fuzzy Ooze that blocks the way.\n\n- Both modes have a key NPC that guides the player throughout an area or splats them if they fail certain objectives (such as running out of ink or time).\nReturn of the Mammalians has O.R.C.A.\nOcto Expansion has C.Q.

Cumber\n\nIn both Octo Expansion and Return of the Mammalians, the player must face a longer final stage made up of multiple sections before attempting to face the final boss of each campaign. Both stages:\n\n- Start with the player having no weapons, requiring them to re-equip their gear along the way.\n\n- Have a section that allows unlimited special weapon use without losing special power.\n\n- Feature two tracks by the game's main idol group, who are also characters in the mode's story.\n\nThe final stage in Return of the Mammalians is the Alterna Space Center. At the beginning of the first part, Alterna Space Center: Entrance, the player has no gear.\n\nThe section for unlimited special weapon use is The Spirit Lifter: First Class with the Zipcaster.\n\nDeep Cut's song Hide and Sleek plays during Alterna Space Center Hangar and Alterna Space Center Lift. Smeared Canvas plays during the missions that take place in the Spirit Lifter: The Spirit Lifter: Steerage and The Spirit Lifter: First Class.\n\nThe first part of Octo Expansion's final stage, Coccyx Phase, starts with the player having no weapons. They get their weapons back during the second section, Villi Phase.\n\nThe section for unlimited special weapon use is Diaphragm Phase with Inkjet as the weapon.\n\nOff the Hook's Nasty Majesty plays during Villi Phase, Belly Phase and Intestinal Phase, and Shark Bytes plays during Diaphragm Phase and Peristalsis Phase.\n\nBoth games' final stages include two sections at the end featuring different boss fights. The penultimate boss has a modified version of the enemy's theme playing in the background, and the final boss features a song by the game's main idol group.\n\nIn both final missions, the successful final attack grows so powerful that the attack damages the game UI in some way.\n\nIn both final missions, being splatted or running out of time will show an additional cutscene of the world being destroyed before showing the 'Continue?' screen.\n\nThe penultimate boss is The Ursine Anomaly - #03, using Bear with Me as the theme.\n\nThe final mission is Return of the Mammalians (mission), using Calamari Inkantation 3MIX as the theme. DJ Octavio's Ink Vac destroys the game UI as the attack power increases.\n\nThe penultimate boss is the brainwashed Agent 3 using Splattack! (Octo) as the the theme.\n\nThe final mission is Turf War (Octo Expansion) using Fly Octo Fly ~ Ebb & Flow (Octo) as the theme. Pearl's Princess Cannon destroys the game UI as the attack power increases.\n\nAfter the player completes Return of the Mammalians, the following changes occur:\n\n- The Great Zapfish can be seen in Splatsville.\n\n- Li'l Judd starts to wear a headset.\n\n- Deep Cut in Splatsville and the Squid Sisters in Inkopolis Plaza both have more enthusiastic animations when the player zooms in on them in their studios.\n\n- The statue used by Mr. Grizz in Grizzco buildings changes from a bear eating a fish to a large fish eating a miniature bear, though his dialogue icon remains the same. The original Mr. Grizz statue appears in Alterna behind the Squid Sisters Camp, and can be interacted with to replay the final Alterna Space Center section or watch the credits again via memories.\n\n- Cuttlefish, in his dried-up form, joins the Squid Sisters and the Captain at the Squid Sisters Camp, where he can be spoken to.\n\n- The Spirit Lifter in Alterna is replaced by a near-identical rocket that is blue rather than orange.\n\n- If the player has fully surveyed all of Alterna by visiting all of the space on the map, the Shel-drone appears on the platform near the Squid Sisters Camp.\n\n- If the player has completed every level in Alterna, the secret kettle for After Alterna appears at the spot where the player first arrived in Alterna.\n\n- Return of the Mammalians is the first single-player mode in the Splatoon series:\nto not have \"Octo\" in its title.\nto not feature any levels based on multiplayer stages.\nto not feature multiple levels focused on Octolings, and to not introduce the Octolings via a mini-cutscene.\n\n- to not have \"Octo\" in its title.\n\n- to not feature any levels based on multiplayer stages.\n\n- to not feature multiple levels focused on Octolings, and to not introduce the Octolings via a mini-cutscene.\n\n- Return of the Mammalians is the only single-player mode in the Splatoon series in which the player can play as either an Inkling or an Octoling, without being restricted to one or the other.\nCuttlefish's quotes about Octarians and squid references do not change when the player is an Octoling.\n\n- Cuttlefish's quotes about Octarians and squid references do not change when the player is an Octoling.\n\n- Agent 3 has two styles of the Hero Suit. A post on Nintendo's official website hinted that they are \"each suited to different situations\".[4]\nIn-game, the torn down version is a \"standard\" form while the other is part of the upgradable Hero set.\n\n- In-game, the torn down version is a \"standard\" form while the other is part of the upgradable Hero set.\n\n- Many mysterious sounds can be heard in Alterna, but are hard to hear and are distorted. This ambient noise includes announcement messages sent over a loudspeaker system to the Alterna Space Center, with various notification sounds and human speech in English reporting on the status of the rocket launch.\n\n- The Booyah Bomb and Tacticooler special weapons are the only ones in the game that were available at the game's launch to not appear in any way in Return of the Mammalians. Big Bubbler, while not available for use by the player, is used by Octolings in the final section of After Alterna.\n\n- Before version 1.1.1, if the player closed the game or entered sleep mode during Deep Cut's news broadcast directly after beating the final boss, they would be forced to replay the entire final section due to a glitch.\n\n- As level progression in Return of the Mammalians is linked to collecting Power Eggs rather than completing levels, the ending can be reached by completing a minimum of 15 levels (the five Crater levels, the three Deep Cut bosses, and the seven stages in the final Alterna Space Center sequence). This is the fewest required levels of any single-player mode in the series, with one fewer than the Octo Expansion.\n\n- to not have \"Octo\" in its title.\n\n- to not feature any levels based on multiplayer stages.\n\n- to not feature multiple levels focused on Octolings, and to not introduce the Octolings via a mini-cutscene.\n\n- Cuttlefish's quotes about Octarians and squid references do not change when the player is an Octoling.\n\n- In-game, the torn down version is a \"standard\" form while the other is part of the upgradable Hero set.\n\n- Splatoon 3 – \"Return of the Mammalians\" – Nintendo Switch"
