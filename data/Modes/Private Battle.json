Private Battles allow groups of two to eight friends to play together in customized matches, where the host selects the mode and stage. It was made available in Splatoon as part of version 2.0.0.[1] Private Battles do not reward players with Battle Points and players' ranks are not affected.[2] Since points are not rewarded, any ticket used from Crust Bucket is not affected. Painting counts toward Turf Inked with the equipped weapon.\n\n- 1 In Splatoon\n\n- 2 In Splatoon 2\n\n2.1 Turf War (Splatfest)\n\n2.1.1 Ink color options\n\n- 2.1 Turf War (Splatfest)\n\n2.1.1 Ink color options\n\n- 2.1.1 Ink color options\n\n- 3 In Splatoon 3\n\n- 4 Quotes\n\n- 5 Gallery\n\n5.1 Icons\n5.2 Screenshots\n5.3 Videos\n5.4 Promotional\n\n- 5.1 Icons\n\n- 5.2 Screenshots\n\n- 5.3 Videos\n\n- 5.4 Promotional\n\n- 6 Trivia\n\n- 7 Names in other languages\n\n- 8 Notes\n\n- 9 References\n\n- 2.1 Turf War (Splatfest)\n\n2.1.1 Ink color options\n\n- 2.1.1 Ink color options\n\n- 2.1.1 Ink color options\n\n- 5.1 Icons\n\n- 5.2 Screenshots\n\n- 5.3 Videos\n\n- 5.4 Promotional\n\nPrivate Battles can have any number of players from two to eight. The host can create even battles (such as 1 vs. 1 or 4 vs. 4) or uneven battles (such as 1 vs. 4 or 3 vs. 2). However, there can only be up to four players per team, and the host cannot assign everyone to the same team. Lobbies created with Private Battle can only be joined by the host's Wii U friends and their Wii U friends. The host can set a four-digit password for the lobby so that uninvited friends cannot join.\n\nThe host of a Private Battle chooses the stage and mode that will be used. There is also a random stage option. All stages and modes are available, and new stages and modes were added as soon as they were released. Players get sixty seconds to ready themselves in the lobby after teams have been selected before the match starts. Like with Squad Battles, players can change their equipped weapon and gear in-between matches without having to leave the lobby and teammates' weapon selections are shown.\n\nIn Splatoon 2, Private Battles can be accessed either online via the menu in Deca Tower or locally via The Shoal. Online and wired LAN options now allow Private Battles to have two spectators to watch battles in addition to the two to eight players. The Spectator View allows the spectators to watch a battle from any player's point of view, as well as a bird's-eye view of the stage. The time limit for teams to prepare themselves in the lobby has been raised to ninety seconds. Also, the host has the option to set certain settings, which differs between the online and local version. The online version only lets the host set one of those options (the ability to turn secondary abilities on or off) while Private Battles at The Shoal lets the host manage to the following:\n\n- No Secondary Abilities — When ON, secondary gear abilities are disabled.\n\n- Use amiibo Gear — When ON, players can use gear saved to an amiibo.\n\n- Use amiibo User Names — When ON, players can use the user name saved to an amiibo.\n\n- Reset Options Every Match — When on, camera options and player settings reset every match.\n\nVersion 4.1.0 added the ability to set voice chat on or off when creating a room in Private Battles without having to use the Online Lounge function, where voice chat still goes through the Nintendo Switch Online mobile app.\n\nTurf War (Splatfest) is a mode in Splatoon 2 only available in Private Battles that was added in version 5.0.0.\n\nIn this mode, the stage is set at night like in a Splatfest, and the standard music is replaced by the Splatfest music (Ebb & Flow, Acid Hues, or Muck Warfare in the first two minutes, and Off the Hook's Now or Never! in the final minute). On MC.Princess Diaries, Fly Octo Fly ~ Ebb & Flow (Octo) will play instead of the regular Splatfest music. In this mode, all 24 Shifty Station layouts can be selected as well as the regular stages, and the player can choose which ink colors to use out of all of the game's Splatfests across all regions (except for Raph vs. Donnie, Hello Kitty vs. My Melody, and Super Mushroom vs. Super Star), along with an option to select randomly. Additionally, if a participating player is wearing the Splatfest Tee Replica, their team's Splatfest team name will display during the match opening.\n\nThis mode plays the exact same way as Turf War would in an actual Splatfest. The only differences are that it does not judge by clout, Inkopolis Square is not changed, and any gear can be worn.\n\nThere are fifty-one ink colors from previous Splatfests that can be selected (as well as the option to select randomly):\n\n- Rock/Pop\n\n- Cake/Ice Cream\n\n- Mayo/Ketchup\n\n- Flight/Invisibility\n\n- Fries/Nuggets\n\n- Front Roll/Back Roll\n\n- Dexterity/Endurance\n\n- Vampire/Werewolf\n\n- Warm/Cold\n\n- Lemon/No Lemon\n\n- Sci-Fi/Fantasy\n\n- Inner Wear/Outer Wear\n\n- Film/Book\n\n- Sweater/Socks\n\n- Action/Comedy\n\n- Champion/Challenger\n\n- Gherk-OUT/Gherk-IN\n\n- Money/Love\n\n- Hana/Dango\n\n- Chicken/Egg\n\n- Newest/Most Popular\n\n- Baseball/Soccer\n\n- Salty/Sweet\n\n- New Lifeform/Future Tech\n\n- Ninja Red/Ninja Blue\n\n- Ninja Orange/Ninja Purple\n\n- Hello Kitty/Cinnamoroll\n\n- My Melody/Pompompurin\n\n- Pulp/No-Pulp\n\n- Squid/Octopus\n\n- Joyous Yellow/Festive Green\n\n- Adventure/Relax\n\n- Fork/Spoon\n\n- Tsubuan/Koshian\n\n- Retro/Modern\n\n- Trick/Treat\n\n- Decadant Red/Tasty White\n\n- Salsa/Guacamole\n\n- Eat It/Save It\n\n- Hero/Villain\n\n- Family/Friend\n\n- Boke/Tsukkomi\n\n- Pancakes/Waffles\n\n- Knights/Wizards\n\n- Hare/Tortoise\n\n- Field Green/Jersey Blue\n\n- Time Travel/Teleportation\n\n- Pineapple/No Pineapple\n\n- Unicorn/Narwhal\n\n- Kid/Grown-Up\n\n- Chaos/Order\n\nIn Splatoon 3, Private Battles can be accessed either online via the menu in the lobby or locally via The Shoal. As with Splatoon 2, Online and wired LAN options allow for two spectators to watch battles in addition to the two to eight players.\n\nNew features that were added to Splatoon 3 include:\n\n- Battles may be interrupted by any player or spectator through holding the button combination , , , , ,  for three seconds.\n\n- By choosing Recon Mode, players can pressto access Photo Mode. This allows them to take photos with other players.\n\n- Before a battle by pressing  players can set a temporary nickname for themselves.\n\n- Splatoon icon\n\n- Both Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3 icon\n\n- Both SplatNet 2 and SplatNet 3 icon\n\n- Splatoon Private Battle selection\n\n- Splatoon password screen\n\n- Splatoon Private Battle lobby\n\n- Splatoon 2 Private Battle lobby\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S2_Private_Battle_name_change.mp4\n\n\nA player changing their name to a string of eleven letters and numbers.

However, if a player disconnects from a Private Battle, the latest missed news announcement will appear.\n\n- If the host of a Private Battle was having a Splatfest, the ink color set for each match would be the host's Splatfest color set.\n\n- If the player scrolls over certain keys in the password selection screen in Splatoon, a simplified version of the main melody of Calamari Inkantation can be played.[4]\n\n- In both the Japanese and English versions of Splatoon, the two teams in a Private Battle are called \"Alpha Team\" and \"Bravo Team\".\n\n- When playing with less than eight players, the squids at the top will be not visible, except for the outline.\n\n- Meals and drinks effects from the Crust Bucket or Crab-N-Go are not consumed during Private Battles.\n\n- Private Battle participators appear at the entrance to Deca Tower if eight or more players joined the most recent match, just like Regular and Ranked Battles.\n\n- While on the waiting screen as a host in Splatoon 2, if the player presses and holds  and , then, while still holding those buttons, presses and holds  and , and then finally, while still holding  and , releases  and , their in-game name will change to an eleven-character string.[5][6] This string is the player's individual ID used by Nintendo's multiplayer server system, which isn't meant to be visible to players; this is likely a debug function intentionally left in.[7][8]"
