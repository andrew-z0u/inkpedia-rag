    "Ranked Battle is one of the multiplayer mode categories in Splatoon and Splatoon 2. Unlike Regular Battles, which only feature Turf Wars, Ranked Battles come in multiple different modes that cycle along with stages. Ranked Battles can last for up to five minutes, unlike the unchanging three-minute time limit in Turf Wars. Ranked Battles are accessible only once a player reaches level 10. Wins and losses in Ranked Battles are counted toward players' ranks, which are used for matchmaking in the mode. Squad Battles in Splatoon and League Battles in Splatoon 2 are variants of Ranked Battles that can be played with friends and a different ranking system. In Splatoon 3, Ranked Battles are replaced by the similar Anarchy Battles.",
    "Ranked Battle was released when a large amount of Splatoon players reached Level 10 on 2 June 2015. Ranks originally ranged from C- to A+. On 6 August 2015, version 2.0.0 increased the rank cap. Ranks then ranged from C- to S+.",
    "Ranked Battles were available at launch with Splatoon 2, though players still must obtain Level 10 to play. All modes were kept from the previous games, with minor improvements made. Along with version 2.1.0 on 13 December 2017, a new mode called Clam Blitz was added. A new rank, Rank X, was added on 25 April 2018 with version 3.0.0.",
    "Stages rotate out every four hours along with the stages from Turf War, at 02:00, 06:00, 10:00, 14:00, 18:00, and 22:00 UTC. The change in stages is accompanied by an announcement from the Squid Sisters. This announcement also kicks all players out of the lobby after they finish their current match. The mode also rotates between Splat Zones, Tower Control, and Rainmaker at the same time.",
    "Similar to Splatoon, Splatoon 2 features stage rotation every two hours, where Off the Hook gives an announcement when the stages and mode change. Players can also view the stage schedule from their smart device using SplatNet 2 on the Nintendo Switch Online app. However, since version 3.0.0, the stages chosen each come from a list of eight stages per Ranked Battle mode that change every month with the X Power reset.",
    "The rotations in the last year since the stages were revamped have been being recycled, so here they are by month below:",
    "The rotations for a given month are the same month-on-month, as described above. However when a stage is newly released or changed, the rotation for the month also changes to show it off:",
    "Unlike in Regular Battles, the music in a Ranked Battle does not change to Now or Never! when there is one minute left.",
    "- Once a player's rank changes after a match, a message saying \"RANK CHANGED! Re-enter the lobby to pit your skills against players closer to you on rank!\" appears and the player is forced to exit.",
    "- Certain stages had stopped appearing in the stage rotation pool for Ranked Battles, as well as other online modes featuring Ranked modes. However, these stages are still playable in Private Battles.\nIn Splatoon, data spanning from August 2015 - December 2016 shows the following stages had not appeared in those modes for a long period:[1]\nSaltspray Rig Tower Control (October 2015 - November 2016) and Rainmaker (October 2015 - November 2015, February 2016 - December 2016)\nBlackbelly Skatepark Rainmaker (October 2015 - December 2015, February 2016 - November 2016)\nPiranha Pit Rainmaker (February 2016 - December 2016)\nPort Mackerel Tower Control (October 2015 - November 2016)",
    "- There was a scrapped Ranked mode, 8-Ball. Much like in the Octo Expansion, teams would shoot a ball and try to get into the enemy's goal.\nIt also seems that extra walls and ramps were added, to prevent the ball from falling off the stage.",
    "- In Splatoon 2, a player's weapon will shine at the beginning of a Ranked Battle if they are on a winning streak.[2]",
