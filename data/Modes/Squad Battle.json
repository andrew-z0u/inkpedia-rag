    "Squad Battle was one of the four multiplayer mode categories in Splatoon, alongside Regular Battle, Ranked Battle, and Private Battle. Squad Battle allowed groups of up to four friends to participate together in Ranked Battle with other squads. A squad would always battle together on the same team, and players who were rank S or S+ would not gain or lose rank points. It was made available as part of version 2.0.0.",
    "When forming a squad, players could create a Quad Squad (four members), a Tri Squad (three members), or a Twin Squad (two members). Squad Battles were always either 4v4, 4v3, or 3v3 battles, since Twin Squads cannot fight alone - they would be paired up with another Twin Squad for a four-player team, and their opponents would also be a pair of Twin Squads. A Tri Squad, however, was treated as a Quad Squad, to their disadvantage when facing actual Quad Squads. However, if they were matched against a Quad Squad, the Tri Squad members were granted a quicker respawn.",
    "If necessary, a squad could be protected by a four-digit password, allowing the creator of the squad to limit it to just invited friends. However, the friends-only rule still stood, so even if someone knew the password to a squad, they could not join unless they were friends with the person who created it.",
    "- There was an Easter egg in this mode as well as in Private Battles: one could play the main melody of Calamari Inkantation using the sounds produced from the individual digits when setting up a password.",
