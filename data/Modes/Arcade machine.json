    "The arcade machine is a video game cabinet. It offers retro-style minigames in Splatoon and Splatoon 2, and appears in Splatoon 3: Expansion Pass, although inactive. In Splatoon, all minigames are played on the Wii U GamePad; they can be played in the lobby while waiting for a battle to start as well as accessed on their own via the physical arcade machine in Inkopolis Plaza. In Splatoon 2, only the physical cabinet in Inkopolis Square is accessible.",
    "The physical arcade machine is found on the left of Inkopolis Plaza, in front of a closed store next to Shrimp Kicks. It is a mainly black upright cabinet, with a splash of pink ink, a drawing of a large blue squid and a black shell on each side. The part around the screen and the control panel is purple, with white strikes surrounding the screen. Below the control panel is a splash of yellow ink and a dark text, and above the screen is a logo of three orange square letters. The arcade machine features a red stick and tree buttons blue, pink and yellow respectively. A power cable can be seen on the right of the machine, sticking into a white wall socket.",
    "Four minigames in total are available through the arcade machine: Squid Jump, Squid Racer, Squidball, and Squid Beatz. Only Squid Jump is unlocked by default; the other three are given as rewards for defeating The Ravenous Octomaw! in amiibo challenges. There is no reward for completing any of the minigames. Once the player has passed all of the stages in one of them, a sign saying \"Congratulations!\" will pop up and the game will reset to the first level.",
    "When a minigame is interrupted by a battle, with the exception of Squid Beatz, it is paused and can be unpaused the next time it is playable. However, progress is not saved when Splatoon itself is closed; the game will start from the first level the next time it is played. The highest score obtained in each of those three minigames will however be saved.",
    "Squid Jump is the first of these games, and was the only minigame playable in the Splatoon Global Testfire.",
    "The objective is to make a squid jump from platform to platform by holding down the  button to jump and using the  or the  to move, to reach a Zapfish placed above the highest platform. The longer  is pressed before a jump, the higher it will be. Purple ink will continuously rise for a certain amount of time, effectively requiring the player to reach the goal within a certain amount of time. As the stages progress, different types of platforms are added: ice (which are slippery), clouds (which move back and forth), and conveyor belts (which run at multiple speeds and move a squid resting on one). This minigame also has no borders, meaning that moving to the right of the screen will make the squid appear on the left, and the other way around. The game has 25 stagesÂ ; a checkpoint exists after every five stages, and the background changes after every ten.",
    "Once a stage has been completed, the player is awarded a stage bonus and a time bonus: the first one, with a fixed value, is worth 300 points up to level 10, 600 points up to level 20, and then 1000 points up to level 25; the second bonus depends on the time taken to complete the level, and drops continuously to zero, at which time the purple ink will have completely rose to the top of the stage. The player has three lives, and gets an extra life for every 10,000 points. Once all lives have been lost, they can choose to either reset the game or go back to the last checkpoint.",
    "Some power-ups also appear throughout the stages, which are:",
    "The second game is Squid Racer, which is unlocked by the Inkling Boy amiibo.",
    "This minigame is a race between the player, a white squid, and several blue jellyfish on stages of different shapes seen from above. The aim is to reach the end of the map before time runs out, avoiding touching the jellyfish and the sides of the stage, which slow the player down. Every track has a time limit; once time runs out, the player will lose a life.The  or the  is used to steer,  for accelerating and  for drifting. The player cannot change direction while they drift, but can instead rotate the squid with the steering controls; releasing the button shoots the player's squid in the direction it faces. Holding the  button during the second half of when the number 2 appears during the countdown triggers a starting boost very similar to the rocket start in the Mario Kart series. The game has 30 stages, and a checkpoint exists after every five stages.",
    "Once a stage has been completed, the player is awarded three bonuses: the first two, stage and time bonus, are identical to the bonuses of the first minigame; the third, a rank bonus, rewards the player according to their position at the finish line (500 in first place, 300 in second, 200 in third, and 0 for subsequent places). The player gets three lives, with additional lives being earned every 10,000 points. Once they have lost all their lives, they can continue from the last checkpoint reached, or restart from the beginning. It is not necessary to finish at a particular rank to continue playing.",
    "Power-ups also appear throughout the stages, visible on the minimap on the bottom right:",
    "The player can benefit from only one power-up at a time, so it can sometimes be advantageous to avoid picking one up so as not to replace a more useful one.",
    "The third game is Squidball, which is unlocked by the Inkling Girl amiibo.",
    "In this game, the player (a white squid) has to hit a certain number of Jellyfish on the other side of a net with a ball (shaped like a Zapfish) to score points and pass on to the next stage. The mechanics are similar to volleyball, with a bump, set, and spike. First, the squid is stuck to the ground and can move using the  stick or the . The ball is then automatically sent on the player side, which has to bounce it upward by letting the ball bounce off the squid (at an angle based on where on the squid the ball struck). The player must then press  once to jump and again while touching the ball to hit it, or continue to hold the  button from jumping to hit the ball when in contact. The angle of the ball changes with the direction held when launching it, which can be either neutral, back or forward. The player must spike the ball for it to count; a ball immediately bounced over the net will pass through the jellyfish harmlessly. The ball will also be lost if it touches the ground on the player side. There are 30 stages, with a checkpoint after every five stages.",
    "The player gets three balls per stage: one small, one medium, and one large. If the specified number of targets is not reached with all three balls, the game ends and the player can restart from either the beginning or the last checkpoint. Each stage awards the player with three bonuses: a stage bonus, identical to the first two games, a point bonus corresponding to 100 points per additional target hit, and a ball bonus worth 200 points per ball remaining after the goal has been reached.",
    "In addition to jellyfish, other creatures can appear on the far side of the net:",
    "The last minigame is Squid Beatz, which is unlocked by the Inkling Squid amiibo.",
    "This game is a music player featuring all 31 tracks from Splatoon coupled with a standard rhythm game.  switches between no game, normal mode, and hard mode, and  pauses the music. The player has to press the control pad and buttons represented on the line at the bottom at the correct time to keep in rhythm with the music, and turn the Jellyfish into yellow rabbits. The player can press any direction on the  (or ) when a control pad icon shows up, or , , ,  or  when a corresponding icon shows up to play the song correctly in tune. There is no penalty if the player misses an input, and the music will keep on going no matter what.",
    "This minigame does not feature a numbered scoring system - instead, it uses yellow rabbit-type creatures to track the score. It is also the only game not to save progress between matches.",
    "Each of the buttons has two different sounds depending on whether the normal or hard mode is selected.",
    "By accessing this game from the lobby while waiting for a match, Bob Dub's Dubble Bath will play by default. By pressing  and  at the same time, any selected song can be played as if one was using the arcade machine.",
    "Squid Beatz was updated in version 2.0.0 to include the four new tracks added and their information.",
    "All text is stylized in capitals in Squid Beatz.",
    "The arcade machine in Splatoon 2 is only accessible from the physical arcade cabinet in Inkopolis Square, located in front of The Shoal between a dancing arcade game used by a NPC and a claw machine that seems to be out of order.",
    "The arcade machine itself has a much more futuristic style than the one in Splatoon: it is much larger and wider, mainly dark grey and white, and features large speakers above the screen. Unlike the arcade machine in the first game, this one appears to be a paid cabinet with a coin slot in the center below the control panel. The panel itself is very wide, looking as if it could be used by two players; it features two round buttons green and pink on each side, with two smaller arrow-shaped ones in the center. Just below the screen are what appear to be small speakers, and a game sticker in the center. Two metal bars surround the screen, extending from the panel to below the large speakers on top. Another set of metal bars are in front of these, supporting a sign displaying the video game title. A white sticker with text in Inkling script can also be found below the control panel on the right.",
    "The only arcade game available on this arcade machine is Squid Beatz 2. As the sequel to Squid Beatz, it is also a rhythm game in which the player presses buttons to the beat of songs from Splatoon 2.",
    "Tracks 1 through 8, 20 through 30, 43 through 49, and 51 through 54 are available from the start; 35 through 42 and 55 through 57 are unlocked by amiibo; the rest are unlocked after they have been heard in-game for the first time. Prior to version 5.2.0, tracks 20 through 26 had to be heard in-game in a Splatfest in order to be unlocked.",
    "Registering the Pearl or Marina amiibo as friends and fulfilling certain requirements allows the player to unlock two new themes for Squid Beatz 2, which are based on the corresponding character.",
    "The arcade machine in Inkopolis Plaza reappears in the Splatoon 3: Expansion Pass, but it no longer functions as an arcade machine, instead being covered by a sheet held with ropes, with a monitor placed on it and a board on top. It functions as a terminal for remote access to Hotlantis in Splatsville. This terminal also appears in Inkopolis Square next to the Galleria, with the original Inkopolis Square arcade machine being removed entirely and replaced with the claw machine which was to the right of it, now functional and used by a NPC.",
