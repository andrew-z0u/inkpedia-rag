    "A Splatfest is a festival-themed event in the Splatoon series that periodically occurs for a limited time. Each Splatfest event revolves around a unique theme, with separate teams representing different responses to a themed question; participating players join a team and compete in a special version of Turf War called Splatfest Battle to raise their teams' scores. Shortly after the event's conclusion the winning team is announced and Super Sea Snails are awarded to all participants, with players on the winning team receiving more.",
    "In Splatoon and Splatoon 2, each Splatfest featured two teams, such as Cats and Dogs, whereas in Splatoon 3, each Splatfest features three teams, such as Rock, Paper, and Scissors.",
    "During a Splatfest, Regular and Ranked Battle options are not available, as they are temporarily replaced by the Splatfest Battle option; Private Battles and Salmon Run can still be accessed.[2]",
    "Splatfest themes and event periods are determined by the \"Voice from on High\", a fax machine, rather than the event organizers or the idols performing during the festivals. Splatfests are announced when the fax machine receives signals from the human era that are bounced back from a Voyager-esque spacecraft.[3] These are interpreted as divine questions from the gods, although the Inklings and Octolings don't always understand what the choices in question are, as there are no dogs or McDonald's, for example, in their current world. Despite this, they still participate as they want to answer the question in some way.[3]",
    "The newscaster idols' heavy involvement in Splatfest announcements and live performances is meant to reflect real-life Japanese festival traditions, wherein female priestesses lead the celebrations.[4] Splatoon 3 expanded upon this concept by introducing Splatfest-exclusive mikoshi floats upon which Deep Cut perform and matoi-like Sprinklers of Doom in Tricolor Battles.",
    "After Splatoon 2's Chicken vs. Egg Splatfest event, Pearl comments that the laws surrounding Splatfests state that the option that won a Splatfest is legally better than the one that lost. This even holds if Splatfest results contradict scientific consensus.[5]",
    "The developers intended to make the Splatfest questions and themes broad and silly enough that they could become general topics of conversation among players' friends and families as well as social media users.[6] As Splatfests expand beyond the games and are not limited by those boundaries, the idols occasionally act as if they know that they are in a video game, as seen in Super Mushroom vs. Super Star, where Marina references the fact that it is Mario's 35th anniversary even though humanity went extinct about 12,000 years ago.[4]",
    "In Splatoon, Splatfests were recurring events hosted by the Squid Sisters, Callie and Marie. Splatfest events would be announced ahead of time via Inkopolis News, immediately after which a pledge box would be in the Plaza and neon signs adorned with up and down pointing arrows appeared on walls and buildings. Twenty-four hours before the event began, the Plaza became noticeably more crowded and two large trucks supporting stage scaffolding appeared in the area's center.",
    "Via the pledge box, players could choose to join one of the teams either ahead of time or during the event period itself. Upon voting, players receive a Splatfest Tee to represent the team they chose; this piece of gear is available exclusively during the event period. During these events, Inklings would participate in battles against members of the opposite team. All multiplayer battle modes would become inaccessible during Splatfests while the Regular Battle mode Turf War would be replaced by its Splatfest-exclusive variant, Splatfest Battle.",
    "Splatfests would take place during the nighttime, in contrast to the standard exclusively daytime lighting available throughout the game, and all non-singleplayer areas of the game would reflect this. Inkopolis Plaza and all the stages would become decorated with a flood of Miiverse posts from the Splatfest/Festival tag on the Miiverse Splatoon community, some of which took the form of neon signs, banners and fireworks. Fireworks went off periodically in the Plaza, and specks of light resembling fireflies or fire embers could be seen rising into the sky. Callie and Marie would perform City of Color throughout the entire duration of the event, dancing upon individual truck stages placed in the Plaza.",
    "During these events, Inklings' ink colors would be limited to the two colors represented by the two Splatfest teams, reflecting which side they were on. The clothing section of the equip screen would become locked, as all players were forced to wear the Splatfest Tee; players could still change hats, shoes, and weapons. After a Splatfest's conclusion, the player's clothing defaults back to the Basic Tee.",
    "Most Splatfest events lasted twenty-four hours, during which time the region involved was isolated and Splatfest players would only face off against players from their region. Meanwhile, all other regions were able to continue playing multiplayer modes as usual. Certain special Splatfests deviated from these rules. Shortly after the event's conclusion, the results would be announced during Inkopolis News then Super Sea Snails would be awarded to all participating players.",
    "The final Splatfest event, Callie vs. Marie, was heavily promoted, with real-life merchandise themed after it; the results of this event influenced the story of Splatoon 2's single-player campaign, Octo Valley.",
    "Unlike in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3, Splatfest events in Splatoon featured a single rotation of three stages for the entirety of the Splatfest's duration.",
    "Splatfests returned in Splatoon 2, now hosted by Off the Hook's members Pearl and Marina. The events' structure was largely the same between games. As Miiverse is not compatible with the Nintendo Switch, players were instead able to submit posts via the new Mailbox; posts made in the time leading up to a Splatfest or during it would appear in-game as neon signs, banners, fireworks or graffiti. Twenty-four hours before a Splatfest began, Off the Hook's stage would start to be constructed above the Battle Lobby entrance on Deca Tower.",
    "During Splatfests, Inkopolis Square would be decorated festively similarly to Splatoon's  Inkopolis Plaza; nighttime would descend across all multiplayer areas of the game, all multiplayer game modes except Salmon Run would become inaccessible in favor of Splatfest Battles, and players were not allowed to swap their equipped clothing out of the Splatfest Tee. Similar to the Squid Sisters' equivalent performances, Off the Hook would perform Color Pulse for the entire duration of the event upon Deca Tower.",
    "After a Splatfest's conclusion, the player's clothing defaults back to the Basic Tee if they are an Inkling, or the Fresh Octo Tee if they are an Octoling.",
    "Splatoon 2's Splatfests continued to be region-locked, lasting twenty-four hours per event throughout Splatoon 2's run, though certain special Splatfests would feature globally shared theming and forty-eight-hour durations.",
    "In a similar vein to Callie vs. Marie, Splatoon 2's Splatfest event Chaos vs. Order was heavily promoted as the game's final Splatfest event. Despite this, four more Splatfests would be held afterwards wherein three previous Splatfest themes were re-run in 2020 with largely unchanged dialogue followed by a new Splatfest in early 2021, Super Mushroom vs. Super Star. Dialogue for that effectively final Splatfest briefly mentions how the Chaos vs. Order event was meant to be the final Splatfest, with no mention of the three rematches between them. The results of Chaos vs. Order are directly tied to the story featured in Splatoon 3's DLC single-player campaign Side Order.",
    "Splatfests returned in Splatoon 3, now hosted by Deep Cut's Shiver, Frye, and Big Man. In Splatoon 3, Splatfests now each feature three teams and last for forty-eight hours.",
    "Every Splatfest is now divided into three parts: Splatfest Sneek Peak, day one, and day two. During the Splatfest Sneak Peek, which begins upon the in-game announcement of the Splatfest a week before the Main Event, players can join a team and begin earning conch shells. The Main Event is split into days one and two; on day one, Deep Cut individually perform Anarchy Poisons atop mikoshi-like floats that parade through Splatsville in a circular path. After day one, a Halftime Report is presented during Anarchy Splatcast wherein the team currently in the lead is announced. Immediately after this announcement, day two commences, in which Deep Cut's three floats combine to form a large stage upon which they perform Anarchy Rainbow. Tricolor Turf War is exclusively available in day two.",
    "Following the 3.0.0 update, players who have purchased the Splatoon 3: Expansion Pass may travel to Inkopolis Plaza; during Splatfests, the Squid Sisters perform there. On the first day they perform City of Color (2023) on individual trucks, while on the second day, they perform Tomorrow's Nostalgia Today upon the trucks placed together to form a single stage.",
    "Following the 7.0.0 update, players who have completed Side Order can access Inkopolis Square, where Off the Hook perform during Splatfests. On the first day, they perform Color Pulse (2024), while on the second day, they perform We're So Back.",
    "Splatoon 3 has several changes for all three hub areas:",
    "- After a Splatfest's announcement:\nIn Splatsville:\nDeep Cut's Splatfest Floats will appear in various locations.\nA Splatfest Tee booth appears alongside the pledge box.\nMetal framing with neon signs and small flags also appear scattered around Splatsville, featuring posts seen in the city.\nThe music heard near the lobby changes to be more festival-like.\nIn Inkopolis Plaza:\nThe Squid Sisters' trucks and a small lift platform appear in the center of the area, with the trucks' screens displaying test patterns.\nThe kitsune and tanuki statues and Inkopolis Tower are repainted in the colors of the first, second, and third teams respectively.\nNeon signs and framing appear around the plaza for displaying user posts, though they are turned off initially.\nA pledge box appears in front of Inkopolis Tower, in the same location it was in Splatoon.\nThe speakers near the tower begin playing Inkopolis News (Splatfest).\nIn Inkopolis Square:\nNumerous containers and the support columns for Off the Hook's stage appear in front of Deca Tower.\nFraming and neon signs for displaying user posts are set up throughout the square, though they are turned off until the Splatfest begins.\nA pledge box appears near the entrance to Shella Fresh\nDeca Tower's speakers begin playing an instrumental dance remix of Color Pulse.",
    "- Two days before the Splatfest, the time of day will change to evening:\nThe entrance of the lobby in Splatsville gains a wooden frame around it as well as various lanterns.\nThe tortoise and origami crane statues on top of the Galleria and The Shoal in Inkopolis Square are lit up.",
    "- One day before the Splatfest:\nIn Splatsville, more lanterns appear, and the torii gate-like structure near the spawn starts shining rainbow neon lights.",
    "- During the two hours between the end of the Splatfest and the announcement of the final results:\nAll three hubs revert to their default time of day.\nA parked white van can be seen in the center area of Splatsville and Inkopolis Plaza. Several items can be seen surrounding the van such as folded sheets of tarp, carts holding wooden planks, and boxes of full garbage bags. In Splatsville, two excavators can be seen with one next to the Tableturf Battle Dojo, and another in the backstreet area. In Inkopolis Square, confetti can be seen scattered across the central area. There is no van in the Square, but the boxes of garbage still appear surrounding the amiibo box.\nStarting with the Shiver vs. Frye vs. Big Man Splatfest, a song performed by Deep Cut, Daybreaker Anthem, can be heard both in the Splatsville plaza as well as inside the lobby. In Inkopolis Plaza, Maritime Memory will play instead; in Inkopolis Square, Into the Light plays. Each of these three songs will continue to play in the lobby of their respective hubs after the results are announced for the next twenty-four hours.",
    "After a Splatfest's conclusion, the player's clothing defaults back to the Tri-Shred Tee.",
    "Splatoon 3 introduces a new Splatfest-exclusive mode separate from Splatfest Battle called Tricolor Turf War, available exclusively during day two of a Splatfest. In this mode, three teams battle at once in a 2v4v2 formation, with the team comprised of four players referred to as \"defenders\" and the two teams comprised of two players each referred to as \"attackers\". The goal of the mode is for one of the two types of teams to cover more turf than the other; one attacking team's success counts as a victory for both attacking teams. A new mechanic is present; via capturing Ultra Signals, Sprinklers of Doom may be summoned.",
    "As of Fresh Season 2024, Fizzbangs are available exclusively in Splatfest Battle and Tricolor Battle.",
    "The majority of Splatfest events now feature all regions participating together simultaneously. Players can change their selected region from the Lobby Terminal, but will not be able to change it for 60 days (1440 hours) after voting for a Splatfest, or after the Splatfest has begun. This timer will be reset to 60 days every time a player votes for a Splatfest, even if a prior prohibition period has not yet expired. Players who change their region during the Splatfest Sneak Peek must restart the game for the region change to take effect.",
    "If a player's console is set to a language that is not available in their Splatfest Region, Splatfest-related text may appear in a different language, such as Anarchy Splatcast broadcasts and Splatfest teams.",
    "- For Splatfests that are exclusive to regions outside of Japan, this dialogue will be displayed in English if the system language is set to Japanese.",
    "- For Japan-exclusive Splatfests, if the system language is set to English or another European language, the game will start normally in the selected language, but the Splatfest-specific dialogues will be displayed in Japanese. If the system language is set to Chinese (Simplified or Traditional) or Korean, the game will be forced to reload in Japanese; after receiving the final results announcement and receiving Super Sea Snails, the game will automatically reload back into the system language.",
    "Splatfest Battle is a mode exclusively available during Splatfest events in the Splatoon series. For the entire duration of a Splatfests, it is the only 4v4 mode in Splatoon and Splatoon 2. In Splatoon 3, it is one of two exclusive modes alongside Tricolor Battle. Similar to Regular Battle, Splatfest Battle only features the Turf War mode.",
    "Tricolor Battle is a new mode exclusive to Splatfests events in Splatoon 3. It becomes available after the Halftime Report of a Splatfest. It features the new Tricolor Turf War mode, a special version of Turf War in which a team of four defenders faces of against two teams of two attackers.",
    "Periodically Splatfests with unique cosmetic and/or mechanical differences from regular Splatfests may occur. Standard special Splatfests tend to minimally differ from standard, while collaboration Splatfests feature brand tie-ins and tend to be accompanied by crossover-themed merchandise.",
    "In contrast, seasonal special Splatfests and final Splatfests offer drastic cosmetic changes accompanied by miscellaneous mechanical differences.",
    "The four reoccurring seasonal special Splatfests are Splatoween, FrostyFest, SpringFest, and Summer Nights. The Splatoon series has had three final Splatfests thus far: Splatoon's Callie vs. Marie, Splatoon 2's Chaos vs. Order, and Splatoon 3's Past vs. Present vs. Future.",
    "Splatfest Power was a feature introduced in version 2.6.0 of Splatoon as a way of tracking players' skill during Splatfests, replacing the Vibe meter. While Splatfest matchmaking was previously based on play styles, players were then matched based on similar Splatfest Power levels.",
    "In Splatoon 2, the player's initial Splatfest Power was based on their performance in their first seven Splatfest matches. After a Splatfest's results were announced the top 100 players would be displayed in SplatNet 2.",
    "Splatoon 3's power levels work similarly to Splatoon 2's. The player's Splatfest Power is based on their performance in their first seven Splatfest matches, though it is only listed in Pro mode. After the results of a Splatfest are announced, the top 100 players' rankings are made available in SplatNet 3.",
    "Clout is a mechanic introduced in version 4.0.0 of Splatoon 2 wherein clout points are awarded to the winning team depending on the Splatfest Power of the losing team.[7] The mechanic  replaced the previous system based only on win rates to a new one based on point tallies. Clout is counted separately for two of the available Splatfest Battle modes, Normal and Pro. Battling against the same Splatfest team does not contribute to the Clout score.",
    "In Splatoon 3, Splatfest Battle counts clouts separate for the Open and Pro mode alongside Tricolor Battle.",
    "Following the 4.0.0 update in Splatoon 2, Open and Pro modes occasionally featured 10x battles, with 100x Battles occurring even more rarely, wherein the clout score awarded was multiplied by a factor of ten or one hundred respectively.",
    "Splatoon 3 reworked the rate system for 100x Battles to be based on festival shells and added 333x Battles as well as Conch Clashes.",
    "Splatoon 2's version 4.0.0 introduced special team names for individual teams of four (not to be confused with the overall Splatfest team) which were assigned if the whole team has matching gear, weapons or appearance.",
    "Splatfest team names are separated into five main categories, each of which has one slot in the final team name, meaning there can only be up to five name parts in a team name. Under these categories are several sub-series that determine what the displayed name unit should be if there are more matching properties within a category.",
    "If every member of a team of four has matching gear, weapons, or appearance, a Splatfest team name is generated. Almost every piece of gear, weapon, or appearance warrants a unique title, which can be mixed with other titles to generate a one-of-a-kind team name.",
    "Many changes have been made to the possible Splatfest team names from the transition from Splatoon 2 to Splatoon 3. This includes changes to returning gear titles, the addition of new gear and gear brands, the addition of new main weapons and weapon classes, the addition of new sub and special weapons, and the addition of new player customization options. Although there have been many changes to the naming system, the amount of unique Splatfest team names is nearly endless.",
    "Players receive Splatfest Points at the end of each Splatfest Battle or Tricolor Battle. Accumulated Splatfest Points are tracked in the Splatfest Rank meter; with each Rank upgrade, players receive a new title, i.e. Cats Champion.",
    "Super Sea Snails are awarded to participants based on their final total Splatfest Rank. Members of the winning team receive slightly more Super Sea Snails than the losing team(s).",
    "Splatfest EXP was earned by participating in and winning matches. Winning a match earned the player points based on their Splatfest Power, and a participation bonus was based on how many Battle Points worth of ground was inked during the match. Players who covered 200–399p worth of ground earned 1 EXP, and 400p or above granted 2 EXP. The player on the winning team with the highest Splatfest Power gained an additional 2 EXP. Players could earn a maximum of 11 EXP per match in the case that their team won, they had the highest Splatfest Power among their team, and they covered at least 400p worth of ground during the match.",
    "One hour after Splatfest concluded, the results were announced during an Inkopolis News broadcast. Results were based on team popularity (the percentage of the votes each team received) and wins (the percentage of matches each team won). As of 2015, the win percentage was worth 6× as much as popularity. Players were awarded Super Sea Snails based on the Splatfest Title they earned, and players on the winning team earned more Super Sea Snails than those on the losing team.",
    "To collect prizes, players had to log into Splatoon before the next Splatfest theme was announced, as the new Splatfest announcement overrode the announcement of winners from the previous Splatfest.",
    "Before version 4.0.0, the Splatfest Rank meter was the same as in Splatoon. The Splatfest Points meter, inking bonuses, and win bonuses were increased by a factor of ten to allow whole number values for the new Synergy Bonuses.",
    "The win bonus for the Splatfest Rank EXP points was based on what the opponents' Splatfest Power is.",
    "The Splatfest Rank meter functions similarly to how it did in Splatoon 2: earning a higher title leads to more Super Sea Snails at the end of the Splatfest. In Splatoon 3, upon reaching the Ruler title, players can continue refilling the 999 point meter to earn the title of Ruler +number, where \"number\" is the number of times it has been refilled, up to Ruler+99[8]. For example, refilling it once changes it to Ruler +1, refilling it twice changes it to Ruler +2 etc. This additional number does not affect the rewards. The titles were also changed to remove any gendered terms.",
    "The final score was calculated based both on popularity and on wins. The formula in Splatoon was as follows:",
    "Final Score (out of 700) = Popularity Percentage + (Win Percentage × 6)",
    "When the Squid Sisters announced the results, the highest of the popularity and win percentages were both individually highlighted before the final results were shown.",
    "The formula used to use Win Percentage × 4, but this was changed in version 2.2.0.",
    "The formula was at first Win Percentage × 2, but this was changed in version 2.0.0.",
    "In Splatoon 2, the final score is a tally of how many categories each team had a majority percentage in. There are three categories:",
    "- Popularity",
    "- Normal Mode Clout",
    "- Pro Mode Clout",
    "Popularity is a straight percentage of how many joined each Splatfest team, while Clout is calculated as the average of each player's total Clout. Before version 4.0.0, the latter two categories were Solo Wins and Team Wins.",
    "When Off the Hook announces the results, the highest of each category is individually highlighted before the final results are shown, just as in the previous game.",
    "In Splatoon 3, each category has scoring values for first and second place attached to it, with the final score being the sum of the number of points won in each category. A maximum of 580 points can be scored. There are five categories:",
    "- Sneak Peek (first place: 90 points, second place: 45 points)",
    "- Votes (first place: 70 points, second place: 35 points)",
    "- Open Clout (first place: 120 points, second place: 60 points)",
    "- Pro Clout (first place: 120 points, second place: 60 points)",
    "- Tricolor Clout (first place: 180 points, second place: 90 points)",
    "Sneak Peek refers to conch shells collected for a team. Votes are a straight percentage of how many joined each Splatfest team, while Clout is calculated as the average of each player's total Clout in each mode.",
    "When Deep Cut announces the results, the highest of each category is individually highlighted before the final results are shown, just as in the previous games. The points are distributed in such a way that a tie for first place is not possible, though there can be a tie for second place.",
    "Before version 3.1.0, the Sneak Peek was worth 8 points, popularity was worth 10 points, and Tricolor Clout was worth 15 points.",
    "Before version 2.0.0, there were only four categories, with Tricolor Clout being combined with Open Clout. Open Clout was worth 15 points while the other three categories were worth 10 each, for a total of 45 points.",
    "Before version 7.0.0, points were only given for winning a category, with 57 points in total. Points were given for winning each category as follows:",
    "- Sneak Peek: 7 points",
    "- Votes: 8 points",
    "- Open Clout: 12 points",
    "- Pro Clout: 12 points",
    "- Tricolor Clout: 18 points",
    "No upcoming Splatfest events announced.",
    "The following tables list all past Splatfests in every region. Bold text signifies the winning team.",
    "Callie always supports the first option, while Marie always supports the second.",
    "Pearl always supports the first option, while Marina always supports the second.",
    "Shiver always supports the first option, Frye always supports the second, and Big Man always supports the third, except for Past vs. Present vs. Future, in which the options were respectively supported by the Squid Sisters, Off the Hook, and Deep Cut.",
    "Italicized text indicates the team in the lead at the halftime announcement.",
    "The teams with the largest and lowest popularity scores to ever win a Splatfest in each game are as follows:",
    "- In Splatoon, Team Night Owl and Team Barbarian won with 71% and 23%, respectively.",
    "- In Splatoon 2, Team Ice Cream and Team Film both won with 76%,[d] while Team Mayo in America won with 26.85%.",
    "- In Splatoon 3, Team Night and Team Handshake won with 68.57% and 18.45%, respectively.",
    "The team with the overall highest popularity score in the series' history was Team Ninja (EU/OC) with 77%, while the team with the lowest popularity score ever was Team Bigfoot with 8.69%.",
    "Marina currently holds the record for the longest Splatfest win streak, winning 7 Splatfests in a row in Europe. On the other hand, Frye holds the record for the longest losing streak, losing 12 Splatfests in a row in all regions except Japan.",
    "For more detailed Splatfest stats, click on either of the games listed (Splatoon, Splatoon 2, and Splatoon 3) to see the respective game's Splatfest trivia.",
    "While the first Splatfest event in Japan (Rice vs. Bread) went by flawlessly, the first North American Splatfest (Cats vs. Dogs) was delayed. The reason given was because of matchmaking issues with Japanese players.[9] The original schedule for the event was from 20 June 2015 at  13:00 UTC for 24 hours. Some days later, it was revealed that it would be moved to 4 July 2015 at  07:00 UTC.",
    "The first European Splatfest event (Rock vs. Pop), which was meant to start on 27 June 2015 at  22:00 UTC, was equally postponed for one week so that it would take place on the same day as the North American one.",
    "Later, Pokémon Red vs. Pokémon Green and Pokémon Red vs. Pokémon Blue were supposed to have their results announced at the same time across all regions, despite the different start and ending times. Initially, the results were going to be announced on 21 February 2016 at  07:00 UTC. However, despite notification of Callie and Marie's announcement, servers ended up being under maintenance half an hour before this, preventing the results from being received. Eventually, an hour later than intended, the servers were running again and players were able to view the results.",
    "- During Splatoon's run, certain randomly selected players could join as early as five minutes before the official start time for faster matchmaking.[10]",
    "- After a Splatfest ends and the player loses their Splatfest Tee, they revert back to wearing the default clothing item: the Basic Tee (in Splatoon and Splatoon 2 if they are an Inkling), Fresh Octo Tee (in Splatoon 2 if they are an Octoling), or Tri-Shred Tee (in Splatoon 3).",
    "- After having selected a team and using the Splatfest booth in Splatoon 2, it is possible to view the winners of 10× and 100× battles. When viewing these before the Splatfest has begun, the screen shows no players, and placeholder text for the team name is shown instead as [Group] [Property] \"Черный шлем для экстрима, Фиолетовые сушитапки 750с и Шпионский зонт «Родиччи»\" — Russian for \"Matte Bike Helmet, Purple Iromaki 750s and Undercover Sorella Brella\" — while the player names are 0123456789 with each player having the Rainmaker as their weapon.[11]",
    "- Each Splatfest art in Splatoon 2 has a small signature next to it at the bottom left side, which denotes which artist made that artwork. For example, Seita Inoue made the Retro vs. Modern Splatfest art as his signature is present on the art.",
    "- In Splatoon, the Battle Dojo used the nighttime theme during a Splatfest, being the only non-Splatfest mode to do so.",
