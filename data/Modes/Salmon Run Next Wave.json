    "Salmon Run Next Waveâ€‹",
    "Salmon Run Next Wave, also known simply as Salmon Run, is a co-op multiplayer mode in Splatoon 3 for up to four players. It is the sequel to Salmon Run in Splatoon 2 and was revealed on 9 February 2022 during a Nintendo Direct.",
    "Like in Splatoon 2, each Salmon Run shift consists of three waves; to complete each wave, players must collect Golden Eggs by defeating Boss Salmonids and depositing them at the egg basket to reach a given quota. Unless otherwise noted, each Boss Salmonid yields three Golden Eggs when splatted. If they are not picked up, a Snatcher will fly over after a few seconds to retrieve them.",
    "Each player can carry only one Golden Egg at a time. While carrying a Golden Egg, players can press  or  to perform an Egg Throw, launching the Golden Egg in an arc similar to thrown bombs. This requires the same amount of ink as a Splat Bomb to perform, but not as much ink is actually used and there is no ink-recovery lag. Performing the Egg Throw also causes a small explosion of ink around the player that deals 100 damage to Salmonids and inks a small area around the player.",
    "If the egg is thrown directly into the egg basket, it is collected: otherwise, it remains on the ground where it lands and does not roll. Throwing a Golden Egg into the water results in it bouncing back to where it was thrown from; if it hits a wall or a Salmonid, it is deflected and changes its trajectory. Any player may pick up a Golden Egg as normal after it has been thrown.",
    "The quota for each of the three waves depends on the number of players present and their ranks. If the quota is not filled before the wave timer ends or the team is wiped out, their shift is terminated. After a shift ends, players are rewarded Grizzco Points based on the amount of Power Eggs and Golden Eggs collected, which can be exchanged for bonuses. All players' ranks increase by 20 points after clearing a shift, unless they are playing with a friend with a lower job title than themselves (note that Profreshionals can gain points with Eggsecutive VPs since version 1.1.1). Similarly, failing a shift reduces all participants' ranks by between 0 and 20 points based on the number of waves cleared (-20 points on the first wave, -10 on the second, and 0 on the third; the deduction is halved if at least one teammate has disconnected). Thus, failing a shift on wave 3 does not change participants' ranks.",
    "The hazard level of a shift determines both the difficulty of the shift, such as how many bosses spawn in a time period, and determines the odds of getting silver or gold scales from an Xtrawave encounter. The hazard level is determined by a formula using the combined rank of all players in the shift. The hazard level for a completed shift can be checked by opening the Recent Jobs list from the menu in Grizzco or via SplatNet 3 (note that the display is rounded to the nearest integer but not internally), which can be used to estimate what the hazard level of the next shift will be. The maximum hazard level possible is 333%, which can only occur for a team whose ranks average Eggsecutive VP 865 or above.",
    "Equipment for collecting eggs is provided by Grizzco, including a Grizzco uniform and a lifesaver, as well as a different supplied main weapon for each wave and two uses of a single special weapon for each shift. When players are splatted, their lifesaver appears at their last position and a teammate can revive them by inking them. Ink level and special weapon uses are displayed visually, with the lifesaver serving as an ink tank with markings, and the player's two specials appearing as packets on their headgear. Additionally, a notification saying \"One player left!\" now appears when only 1 player is still alive.",
    "Known Occurrences return from Splatoon 2, with new ones being added, such as Mudmouth Eruptions and Giant Tornado.[1] Additionally, an event called Big Run, where Salmonids invade inhabited cities, happen once every few months and take place on battle stages.[2] There are also occasional Eggstra Work shifts, being 5 waves long on a fixed job scenario, with the aim being to retrieve as many Golden Eggs as possible.[3]",
    "The difficulty of Salmon Run Next Wave is considerably higher than Salmon Run in Splatoon 2, with the hazard level, quota, and spawn rates increasing drastically, partially due to the ability to throw Golden Eggs, and the new mobility provided by moves such as Squid Surging and Squid Rolling. Because of this, the game can begin to slow at higher levels unless players maintain control of the bosses. Prior to version 6.0.0, players no longer reset to 400 upon the termination of a rotation, instead resetting back to 40, making the time taken to reach max hazard level and EVP 999 much longer.",
    "Occasionally, after a successful third wave, an Xtrawave occurs, during which a large King Salmonid and multiple other Boss Salmonids appear. The primary objective is not to deposit eggs but to defeat the King Salmonid. During this wave, players are supplied with egg cannons; these convert Golden Eggs into powerful projectiles that deal 800 damage each[4] and do not consume ink, but break on contact (even if they hit the ground). The egg cannon can be used to splat all Lesser Salmonids and most regular Boss Salmonids in one shot by hitting their weak point (if applicable), and they are largely used to damage the King Salmonid. If the player is holding an egg, a special weapon-esque notification encourages them to attack the King Salmonid with it. Players have 100 seconds to defeat the King Salmonid, and the wave ends prematurely if no players remain alive. If players fail to defeat the King Salmonid, the shift is still considered cleared.",
    "If an Xtrawave is due to occur, the victory jingle after wave 3 will be slightly distorted, and the final triumphant horn will be immediately followed by a siren and a large, orange notification saying \"EMERGENCY!\". This is then followed by a short cutscene of the King Salmonid emerging from the water and roaring. The crew members then Super Jump back to the start point, or a unique lowered start point if the third wave was low tide, and the text \"XTRAWAVE\" will appear as they land. The Xtrawave also takes place with a unique red sky, rather than the normal orange sky or the night environment used for most Known Occurrences, and will use the same tide level as the previous wave (i.e. if wave 3 took place at high tide, the Xtrawave will too).",
    "An Xtrawave is guaranteed to occur when the Salmometer, a King Salmonid-shaped meter appearing below the player's rank bar while they are in the Grizzco Lobby, is full for every player in the group. Otherwise, the chance of an Xtrawave occurring scales based on the total value. A minimum team smell of 5 is required for the chances of an Xtrawave occurring to begin.[5] The meter fills after every shift, whether successful or not, and empties for everyone in the party when the special wave occurs. The Salmometer also resets between different rotations. If everyone in a team starts with a smell of 0, the chance of an Xtrawave happening is 0% for the first two rounds, 10% for the 3rd round, 30% for the 4th round, 60% for the 5th round, and 100% for the 6th round, if no Xtrawave happens until the 6th round.[6] Until wave 3 is complete, there is no way of knowing whether or not a shift will result in an Xtrawave, unless one is aware of the Salmometer levels of their teammates.",
    "Damaging the King Salmonid during an Xtrawave rewards the player with fish scales, a precious resource that has three types: bronze, silver, gold; the less common varieties of which are associated with higher hazard levels.[7] Fish scales can be exchanged for Splashtag banners, locker room items, and Grizzco-approved alternate work outfits.[7]",
    "The Xtrawave grants the player scales ranging from 2 to 13; two for entering the Xtrawave, one for every 12.5% damage the team dealt to the King Salmonid (a maximum of eight for a victory), and one for every ten seconds remaining on the clock when the King Salmonid is defeated (a maximum three for 30 seconds or more left).[8]",
    "Getting silver and gold scales is random, with the chance percentage correlates to the hazard level using the formula 5 + 15/333 * H for silver and 3/333 * H for gold, where H stands for hazard level percentage. At max hazard level (333%), there is a 20% chance per scale to be silver, and a 3% chance per scale to be gold.[8][9] The list below shows some calculated examples.",
    "Since Version 9.0.0 (Splatoon 3), it is guaranteed to get a minimum of 3 silver fish scales and 1 gold fish scale from the rewards meter per rotation, at 500 Grizzco points and 1100 Grizzco points respectively.",
    "Big Runs are a special event where Salmonids invade the city, causing a multiplayer stage to become a temporary Salmon Run stage. Players can then fight against the invading Salmonids and collect their Golden Eggs on the reworked stage. Big Runs share similarities to Splatfests, as they are announced one week in advance, last for 48 hours, and feature final results with rewards for participating players.",
    "Eggstra Work is a special event involving shifts lasting 5 waves, on a fixed job scenario, with the aim being to score as many golden eggs as possible. Similarly to Big Runs, players are awarded prizes after the end of the Eggstra Work based on their performance relative to the playerbase at large.[3] Unlike Big Runs, these run concurrently with the regular Salmon Run stage rotations, allowing players who do not wish to participate/are unable to participate in the Eggstra Work to still play regular Salmon Run.",
    "Unlike in Splatoon 2, Grizzco Industries is almost always open for business - this includes during Splatfests. The only exception is during server maintenance, during which all multiplayer services are disabled.[2]",
    "Salmon Run rotations usually change every 40 hours (a day and 16 hours). Rotation change happens at 00:00, 16:00, or 08:00 UTC, in order and repeating. However, Big Runs always start at 00:00 UTC, therefore disrupting the usual schedule. The Salmon Run rotation immediately preceding the Big Run will be shortened or lengthened to fit the schedule of the Big Run, with the shortest duration being 24 hours, and the longest being 56 hours. The rotation following the Big Run keeps the usual duration.",
    "Big Run rotations last for 48 hours (two full days), presumably always starting (and then ending) at 00:00 UTC. Big Runs only happen once per season, and usually in place of that month's Splatfest. Any player can play in a Big Run, regardless of rank. Finally, unlike most regular rotations, Big Runs are publicly announced in-game a few days in advance of occurrence. After a Big Run ends, the normal rotation schedule resumes immediately.",
    "Almost all main weapons are usable in Salmon Run Next Wave, with the exceptions being the Splatterscope, the E-liter 4K Scope, and any variant main weapons such as the Tentatek Splattershot (as their usual distinguishing mechanical attributes of different sub and special weapons would not apply in this mode). The damage dealt by main weapons is adjusted for Salmon Run when compared to other multiplayer modes, especially for charging weapons or weapons with slow firing rates - for example, the Splat Roller deals 200 damage rather than the usual 150 with a horizontal flick, while the Heavy Splatling and Nautilus 47 are both buffed to deal 35 damage per shot when fully-charged. The dummies in the Salmon Run waiting area reflect these changes to damage scaling.",
    "Like in Splatoon 2, the only sub weapon available in Salmon Run Next Wave is the Splat Bomb.",
    "Unlike in Splatoon 2, there are more than four special weapons available in Salmon Run Next Wave. Special weapons are loaned out at random at the beginning of each shift, do not change between waves, and are unaffected by rotations. Since version 6.0.0, a team will always be assigned at least two specials that are capable of attacking Salmonids at a distance (marked with a â€¡ in the list below). The available special weapons are:",
    "Each player receives two of their assigned special to use during the regular waves. If an Xtrawave occurs, all players are provided a fixed number of special uses, regardless of how many they had used in prior waves: one use against most King Salmonids, and two uses when facing a Triumvirate.",
    "There are seven stages available for Salmon Run Next Wave.",
    "Big Run is an occasional event in Salmon Run Next Wave, in which the Salmonids invade the Splatlands and/or Inkopolis. Each time a Big Run occurs, the Salmonids invade at least one particular multiplayer stage, changing its layout and flooding it with water for the duration of the event.",
    "Wildcard rotations return in Salmon Run Next Wave, the first starting on 1 October 2022 at 16:00 (UTC).[12] All types of wildcard rotations from Splatoon 2 return, including all-wildcard rotations, single wildcard rotations, in which only one of the four weapons is random, and rare-only rotations[13].",
    "During an all-wildcard rotation, or a rare-only rotation, the only weapon available in the testing range is the Splattershot. After a shift ends, players are still equipped with the weapon they ended the shift with in the testing range, but it is replaced with the Splattershot when the bihourly multiplayer stage rotation happens, or when they interact with the weapon-equipping container. During single-wildcard rotations, players may only equip the non-wildcard weapons in the testing range.",
    "Grizzco-brand weapons return for wildcard rotations and four new weapons, the Grizzco Stringer, Grizzco Splatana, Grizzco Dualies, and Grizzco Roller, have been added.",
    "For a history of wildcard rotations, see Salmon Run Next Wave data.",
    "There are nine different events in Salmon Run Next Wave, with some having variants. Seven of the events return from Salmon Run in Splatoon 2.",
    "A feature added in version 2.0.0 allows saving and replaying job scenarios. It allows players to replay a previous Salmon Run shift. Job scenarios can be accessed from the Grizzco Terminal, and can be shared via codes. These job scenarios can also be viewed from SplatNet 3. Big Run and Eggstra Work job scenarios cannot be saved. Unlike Battle replays, the players' inputs are not saved. Due to this, it is not possible to watch a replay of the original shift. Players must play the job scenarios using Private Jobs.",
    "We've even recorded a 333% increase in hazard level at the sites where Eggsecutive VPs work.",
    "All job titles from Splatoon 2 return. A new title, Eggsecutive VP,[7] has been added following the Profreshional title.",
    "At Eggsecutive VP, the pay grade is calculated as 2.3 + floor([Rank Points] / 50) Ã— 0.05. The highest possible pay grade is Ã—3.25 at Eggsecutive VP 950 - 999.",
    "IDV stands for internal difficulty value and is how the game keeps track of the difficulty without using job titles and rank points. One IDV is worth 0.2% hazard level, which is capped at 1665 for Eggsecutive VP 865 - 999, equivalent to hazard level 333%.",
    "As in Splatoon 2, titles are retained across Salmon Run rotations, but the point ranges are reset to the 40-point mark within the player's current title, including the new Eggsecutive VP title. Beginning in version 6.0.0, players who have previously earned badges on a particular stage will start new rotations at a higher level within Eggsecutive VP:",
    "At ranks Go-Getter and above, it is possible to manually demote oneself by pressing  in the menu of the Grizzco Lobby.",
    "On the result screen that displays the performance of each player, there are five numbers. The top left number is the quantity of Golden Eggs delivered to the basket by the player, the number in brackets in the top left is the quantity of Golden Eggs assisted (thrown) by the player and ultimately delivered to the basket by another player, the bottom left number is the quantity of Power Eggs collected, the top right number is how many times the player revived another player, and the bottom right number is how many times the player had to be revived.",
    "Completion of a round of Salmon Run Next Wave grants players Grizzco Points, which they can redeem at the exchange desk inside Grizzco Industries for bonuses. The points earned after any run are calculated with the formula G*(E+P/200)+50*C, where G is the pay grade number after any raises or penalties, E is the number of Golden Eggs collected, P is the number of Power Eggs collected, and C is 1 upon completing all 3 rounds successfully, 2 upon successfully defeating the King Salmonid, otherwise 0. (However, due to a bug as of version 1.2.1, C is equal to 2 even if losing to the King Salmonid.) All counts are rounded down to the nearest integer. Players also earn Catalog Points which increase their catalog level (300 points per wave cleared, including if the Xtrawave is cleared). If the player participates in an Xtrawave and damages the King Salmonid, they receive fish scales.[7]",
    "Every 100 Grizzco Points (200/400 after reaching 1200/4000 points in a rotation, or 2400/5200 for a Big Run rotation) earns the player one bonus \"capsule\", which come in different colors representing the type of the contents, or a piece of gear. The main ability of this item is randomly determined when the bonus is redeemed. It usually has up to three randomly filled secondary gear ability slots. If the player receives gear they already have, they can either replace the old gear with the new version or receive ability chunks (equal to the filled slots) instead.",
    "Normal, non-superbonus capsules have a 50% chance of providing a poor reward, a 40% chance of providing a good reward, and a 10% chance of providing an excellent reward. At 600 and 1200 points, the player earns a superbonus, which always contains the 10% chance reward. The type of superbonus capsule is fixed for the length of a rotation. After 1200 points, the player only earns the current gear or pink capsules until the rotation ends. During a Big Run, all types of rewards can appear up to 2400 points, with additional superbonuses at 1800 and 2400. The capsules of the rewards until the second superbonus are different for every player.",
    "Pink capsules contain gear aside from the one currently in rotation. During the first gear rotation, when the Bream-Brim Cap was the only gear piece available, pink capsules did not appear as a reward.",
    "The exchange desk stores only a maximum of 99 capsules. Each additional capsule that the player receives without collecting the previous rewards will be lost.",
    "Gear by Grizzco Industries is obtained from Salmon Run bonus rewards. When obtained, each gear reward has random initial star power and abilities. The star power is initialized from 0 to 2 stars with all secondary ability slots filled, while the initial primary ability cannot be any primary-exclusive one. If the player receives gear they already have, they can either replace the old gear with the new version or exchange the new gear for ability chunks (equal to the secondary abilities, but not the primary ability) instead. A new piece of gear is added each month, similar to Splatoon 2.",
    "By defeating or damaging a King Salmonid, players are rewarded with fish scales that they can use to purchase work suits, gear,  decorations, stickers, or banners. Most items are locked by default, however, the rest are unlocked by spending more scales. There are two milestones for spending scales at the shop. The first milestone requires spending at least Â 100 and Â 10 to unlock, while the second milestone requires spending at least a total of Â 350, Â 40, and Â 4.[17] All items are made purchasable after the second milestone is reached.",
    "Salmon Run Next Wave offers a variety of badges related to stages, bosses and the Big Run and Eggstra Work events.",
    "There are multiple changes in Salmon Run Next Wave compared to the original Salmon Run, including:",
    "Now, at the end of the day, it's all about that paycheck. And we think Salmon Run workers are handsomely rewarded! Diligent employees who have collected fish scales can trade them in for bonus items like designer work suits. As always, we support a healthy work-splat balance.",
