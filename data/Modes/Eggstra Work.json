The mode was revealed on social networks on 20 February 2023.[1][2] Similar to Big Runs, Eggstra Work events are limited-time contests where players compete as part of a team to collect the most Golden Eggs in a set scenario of five waves.\n\n- 1 Description\n\n- 2 Rewards\n\n- 3 Eggstra Work shifts\n\n- 4 Quotes\n\n- 5 Dialogue\n\n- 6 Badges\n\n- 7 Gallery\n\n7.1 Top Teams and Average Roe\n\n- 7.1 Top Teams and Average Roe\n\n- 8 Trivia\n\n- 9 Etymology\n\n9.1 Names in other languages\n9.2 Translation notes\n\n- 9.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 9.2 Translation notes\n\n- 10 References\n\n- 7.1 Top Teams and Average Roe\n\n- 9.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 9.2 Translation notes\n\nDescribed as a \"team-building event\", Eggstra Work shifts follow the same pattern as regular Salmon Run shifts, occurring on regular Salmon Run stages, though players face five waves instead of the typical three.[3] As the scenario is pre-set, the initial hazard level - as well as order and location of Salmonid spawns - are the same for all teams, allowing players to learn and optimize their strategies. Players can also select which weapon they will wield for the full duration of an Eggstra shift, however, it is imperative to note that multiple players cannot choose the same weapon, and groups of two that queue freelance Eggstra work are not guaranteed to use the weapon they have selected.\n\nThe starting Hazard Level is set to 60%. Therefore, Wave 1 always has a quota of ten Golden Eggs. Reaching 1.5× or 2× the quota in a wave increases the Hazard Level for the next wave. The amount the Hazard Level increases depends on the number of players within the current shift.[4]\n\nBefore Version 4.0.0, Eggstra Work shifts could only be entered alongside members of the player's friends list, or via a Pool. This led to participants being able to compete in the event without having a full group of four players. Following the update, matchmaking similar to Freelance mode has been implemented to bring each group's member count to four. As such, players are now able to enter the event solo.\n\nAt the end of the Eggstra Work event, exclusive locker stickers are awarded based on the highest team-wide Golden Egg total the player achieved in any shift. This score is ranked relative to the high scores of all participating players, with different stickers awarded to players whose high score is in the top 5%, top 20%, top 50%, or bottom 50% of scores.[3]\n\nPlease allow us to clarify. Each Eggstra Work session will have five waves and share the same job scenario, so it's imperative for you and your coworkers to plan ahead and maximize efficiency. All participants will receive a sticker. Top workers will receive a better sticker.\n\nTeam up with friends and compete for the high score (and in-game prizes) in set Salmon Run scenarios. Look out for the first contest in April!\n\nBadges are available for reaching each tier of high score in any Eggstra Work event.\n\n- Promotional image of a team of Grizzco workers\n\n- The Eggstra Work menu option in-game\n\n- The results screen from an Eggstra Work event shift\n\n- Diagram explaining the Eggstra Work event score system\n\n- The Special Bonus Meter that fills when completing Eggstra Work shifts\n\n- Warning message when queueing for eggstra work as a duo\n\n- Bulletin Board used for displaying event results.

As a result, the highest possible quota for Wave 1 surpassed 21 Golden Eggs.\n\nEggstra Work is a pun on extra work and egg, emphasizing the importance of collecting Golden Eggs in this event."
