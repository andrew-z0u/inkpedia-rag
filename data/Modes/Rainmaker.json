    "Rainmaker is one of the three Ranked Battle modes in Splatoon, alongside Splat Zones and Tower Control, and four in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3 alongside Splat Zones, Tower Control, and Clam Blitz. Rainmaker was the third Ranked Battle mode introduced in the series and the last in Splatoon.",
    "Rainmaker was first announced in the Splatoon Direct on 7 May 2015. However, its description was extremely vague and only a picture of the Rainmaker itself was released. The weapon was later shown in action in a Japanese Splatoon commercial that was released in late July 2015. Rainmaker was released on 15 August 2015 at 02:00 UTC.[1]",
    "Rainmaker was first confirmed to return for Splatoon 2 on 2 June 2017 in a Nintendo YouTube video.[2]",
    "The Rainmaker was changed to fire an exploding ball of ink rather than an ink tornado. A modified Rainmaker that has significantly more range and does not explode after carrying it for too long is given by Sheldon during the final phase of the final boss in Octo Canyon.",
    "The Rainmaker is reset to the center of the stage after popping its shield and not taking it for fifteen seconds. It does not reset when it is already located at the center of the stage.",
    "Rainmaker appears as a type of test that Agent 8 must pass to escape the Deepsea Metro; the Rainmaker has the Kamabo Corporation logo on it instead of the anchor logo of the standard ranked mode. The mode works the same as a regular Rainmaker match but Agent 8 is up against a team of four Sanitized Octolings. The Rainmaker appears on Agent 8's pedestal and they have to carry it through the enemy's base by themselves and place it on the opposing Rainmaker pedestal.",
    "These levels are:",
    "- A02 Far-Out Station",
    "- F09 Bring It Station",
    "Unlike in multiplayer, the Rainmaker can be carried anywhere in the stage and does not automatically splat the user if held onto for too long. Additionally, the Sanitized Octolings do not attempt to take the Rainmaker themselves - if they break the Rainmaker's barrier, it is reset to its start point.",
    "In Splatoon 3, instead of just a single goal at the end, there are also one or two goals closer to the middle of the stage called checkpoints. Once a player plants the Rainmaker on a checkpoint, all checkpoints will lower and the Rainmaker goal will pop up. The shield will reform, and either team can then break the shield and take the Rainmaker. When the Rainmaker is held, the special gauge of the player carrying it will display the Rainmaker and the player icons at the top of the screen will show which player is holding it. A team must land the Rainmaker on a checkpoint before they can score any points beyond it.",
    "Rainmaker is similar to Tower Control in that it requires teams to move a certain object to a point in the other team's base. However, in Rainmaker, only one player may have control of the Rainmaker and they control where it goes. The device is encased in a shield similar to a Zapfish's bubble and must be freed before it can be picked up. If one team bursts the Rainmaker shield, all players of the other team caught in the blast radius are instantly splatted. The Rainmaker can then be picked up by either team. Touching an intact shield causes a small amount of damage.",
    "After picking up the Rainmaker, it has some effects on the carrier:",
    "Rainmaker explosion timer\nThe player who holds the Rainmaker must carry it to the goal in the other team's base within sixty seconds or it explodes, splats the carrier and every friendly player in the blast radius, and covers the ground with enemy ink. The marker displaying the time remaining appears above the carrier's head. If the player holding the Rainmaker is on their side of the map and they retreat a certain distance backwards, a \"Don't retreat!\" message will appear at the bottom of their screen, and the Rainmaker explosion timer will tick three times faster than normal. If the player moves close enough back to where they began to retreat, the message disappears and the timer ticks at its normal rate again. The Rainmaker explosion timer also ticks faster than normal when the carrier is in a prohibited area, displaying \"Rainmaker-free zone!\" on the bottom of the carrier's screen. In Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3, when the carrier of the Rainmaker explodes on their side of the stage, the Rainmaker resets to the center of the stage.",
    "Firing the Rainmaker\nThe Rainmaker itself is capable of shooting large twisters of ink, similarly to an Inkzooka (in Splatoon), or bursts of ink (in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3). The Rainmaker has similar attributes to a charger-class weapon, due to it having a charge mechanic. The shots that it can fire range from a small twister or burst to a large tornado-like twister or big, explosive burst depending on the length of time that  is held down by the player. At maximum charge, the shot is lethal, allowing the Rainmaker carrier to have a form of defense against enemy fire. The projectile in Splatoon 2 is fired in an arc, allowing its shots to hit enemies behind cover but making it much less effective in close quarters.",
    "The Rainmaker carrier should note that shots from the Rainmaker do not consume ink, and therefore they do not need to consider refilling their ink tank when defending or attacking.",
    "Effects on the carrier\nThe player holding it cannot Super Jump, enter any spawn point, nor can they use any of their main, sub, or special weapons. Because the Rainmaker is so heavy, the player's movement speed and swim speed are reduced by 20%, and speed-increasing abilities affect the player normally no matter what weapon they were carrying prior. The special gauge does not charge while carrying it. If it is dropped, the Rainmaker shield reforms around it. It can then be recaptured by any player on both teams.",
    "If the player has the Rainmaker and splats themselves by falling off the stage while behind the halfway point, the Rainmaker resets its position by respawning in the center of the stage. This does not happen when the player splats themselves by falling off the stage over the halfway point, and the Rainmaker regenerates its shield where the player fell from.",
    "After firing, the Rainmaker has a knockback effect on the player. The pushback from firing the Rainmaker can be used to go through enemy ink reasonably quickly, so if the player is stopped without a chance of making a new path, firing the Rainmaker behind repeatedly can get the player a little extra push before being splatted.",
    "Tracking the Rainmaker\nThe player holding the Rainmaker has the Ranked Battle symbol marking them for everyone to see above their head alongside the sixty-seconds explosion timer, making them a huge target. The symbol can be seen on the map and even through walls when the player is in humanoid form.",
    "When swimming in ink in squid or octopus form, the Ranked Battle symbol disappears for the enemy team, making it more difficult to spot the Rainmaker, but an additional glow is added where the carrier swims.",
    "The \"winning team\" is the team who managed to carry the Rainmaker closer to the other team's base than the other team (if tied, the team who carried to the tied point first[a]) and the \"losing team\" is \"the other (team).\"",
    "Overtime begins when:",
    "- The latest carrier, who is on the winning team, gets splatted less than fifteen seconds before the end of regulation.\nNote that the carrier getting splatted right after breaking through the checkpoint does not include in this scenario.",
    "- The losing team is in control of the Rainmaker.",
    "- (in Splatoon 3) The latest carrier, who is on the losing team, breaks through the checkpoint less than a few seconds before the end of regulation.",
    "Overtime ends when:",
    "- The winning team regains control of the Rainmaker.",
    "- The losing team fails to pick up the Rainmaker 10 seconds after:\nOvertime commences.\n(in Splatoon 3) The losing team breaks through the checkpoint.",
    "- The carrier on the losing team gets splatted.\nNote that the carrier getting splatted right after breaking through the checkpoint does not include in this scenario.",
    "- The losing team carries the Rainmaker past the winning team's score, giving them the victory.",
    "Other info:",
    "- If the Rainmaker has not been touched for the whole match, Team Alpha wins.\nTeam Alpha and Team Bravo are assigned randomly at the start of the match; players are not informed which they are on.",
    "- The status of the Rainmaker shield (popped or not) does not matter.",
    "Players' special gauges will fill automatically under certain conditions.",
    "- When a team possesses the Rainmaker, the special gauges of the opposing team will fill at 3p per second.",
    "- When the Rainmaker is unclaimed, the special gauges of the losing team will fill at 3p per second.",
    "Prohibited areas, or Rainmaker-Free Zones, are areas that are harder for the enemy team to reach. They were introduced in version 2.4.0 of Splatoon. They appear in certain stages and are indicated with a Rainmaker-Free signpost by their entrance. When the Rainmaker carrier enters the prohibited area on their side of the stage, they get a penalty as the Rainmaker explosion timer ticks faster, just like when retreating with the Rainmaker.",
    "If the carrier runs out of time or gets splatted in the prohibited area, the Rainmaker respawns at the center of the stage. The effects do not occur when the attacking team enters the prohibited area of the defenders.",
    "Stages in Splatoon that have prohibited areas are Walleye Warehouse, Saltspray Rig, Arowana Mall, Flounder Heights, and Piranha Pit.",
    "Stages in Splatoon 2 that have prohibited areas are The Reef, Musselforge Fitness, Starfish Mainstage, Inkblot Art Academy, Port Mackerel, Blackbelly Skatepark, MakoMart, Walleye Warehouse, Shellendorf Institute, Arowana Mall, Goby Arena, Piranha Pit, Camp Triggerfish, Wahoo World, New Albacore Hotel, Ancho-V Games, and Skipper Pavilion.",
    "Stages in Splatoon 3 that have prohibited areas are Scorch Gorge, Eeltail Alley, Hagglefish Market, Undertow Spillway, Mincemeat Metalworks, Hammerhead Bridge, Museum d'Alfonsino, Mahi-Mahi Resort,  Sturgeon Shipyard, MakoMart, Wahoo World, Brinewater Springs, Flounder Heights, Um'ami Ruins, Shipshape Cargo Co., Robo ROM-en, Marlin Airport, Lemuria Hub, and Urchin Underpass.",
    "- Prohibited area in Flounder Heights from Splatoon.",
    "- Prohibited Area sign in Splatoon 2.",
    "- Prohibited area in Scorch Gorge from Splatoon 3.",
    "- In European versions of Splatoon, the objective text reads \"Transport the Rainmaker!\" instead of \"Make it rain!\"",
    "- Details of Rainmaker were datamined on 21 June 2015.[3]",
    "- Images of Rainmaker being played on a then-unnamed stage, later revealed to be Hammerhead Bridge, were revealed in the 24 July 2015 Japanese Splatoon trailer detailing future updates.",
    "- After sixty seconds, or when a player approaches their base, the Rainmaker explodes and the display reads \"The Rainmaker Inksploded\"(NA) or \"Splatted when the Rainmaker exploded!\"(EU/OC).",
    "- When in motion, the Rainmaker carrier is expressionless. When still, they make a big smile.",
    "- Rainmaker bears a strong resemblance to Team Fortress 2's Capture the Flag mode, where a team needed to grab the objective from the enemy's base and bring it to their base. However, in Splatoon, they need to grab the objective in the middle and carry it to the enemy's base onto a goal. Some maps include a custom-version that functions identically to Capture the Flag, with a flag in the middle which needs to be carried to enemy's base.\nIt bears an even stronger resemblance to Push from Team Fortress Classic, with the flag being in the middle of the map, and the objective being to bring it to a raised platform in the enemy's base.",
    "- Blackbelly Skatepark is the only stage to appear in both games that has not seen Rainmaker in rotation for the longest amount of time due to its old layout, which allowed Rainmaker carriers to easily score a knockout within the first minute of a match, but was brought back after said Stage's adjustments from version 4.3.0.",
    "- In Rainmaker, Battle Points continue to count when using the Rainmaker weapon for the player's total Battle Points of the match and the total turf inked with their weapon.",
    "- In Splatoon 3, the goal pedestal has a new special animation when a team carries the Rainmaker all the way to the goal which was not present in previous games. The sides appear to buckle outwards, as if the podium is being broken by the force of the Rainmaker being slammed onto it. This does not occur to the Checkpoint pedestals.",
