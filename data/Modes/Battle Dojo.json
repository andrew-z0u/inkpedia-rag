It was announced on 1 April 2015 during a Nintendo Direct.\n\n- 1 Description\n\n- 2 Stages\n\n- 3 Weapons and gear\n\n- 4 Gallery\n\n- 5 Trivia\n\n- 6 Names in other languages\n\n- 7 References\n\nBattle Dojo is playable by two people on the same console, one using the Wii U GamePad and its screen and the other using the Wii U Pro Controller, or Wii Classic Controller and the TV screen. The only mode playable in the Battle Dojo is Balloon Battle.\n\nOnce a Balloon Battle match begins, a column of light, marking a location, appears. Players must travel to this location and shoot the seven balloons that appear within twenty seconds. Each balloon is worth one point, and two when there is one minute left in the match. After all seven balloons are popped or are not popped after a certain amount of time, a new light column appears. The first player to reach thirty points or the player with the most points after five minutes wins the round.\n\nPlayers can splat each other to reduce the other's points. (Going out-of-bounds or dissolving in the water does not cost points.)\n\nCans make an appearance here and will either give the players a status effect, sub weapon, or special weapon. These can be found by breaking open crates found in various areas around each stage. All obtainable content from the cans are used immediately upon getting them, so specials are not able to be stored for later use.\n\nA list of the obtainable items and conditions from the cans are shown below.\n\n- Bubbler: Equips player with a Bubbler.\n\n- Disruptor: Causes the opponent to suffer as if under the effects of a Disruptor.\n\n- Full Power-Up: Causes the player to receive a temporary boost to their run speed, swim speed, and ink recovery.\n\n- Inkstrike: Automatically sends an Inkstrike to the opponent's current location.\n\n- Inkzooka: Equips the player with an Inkzooka.\n\n- Point Sensor: Causes the player to see the opponent as if under the effects of a Point Sensor.\n\n- Sprinkler: Automatically places a Sprinkler in front of the player.\n\n- Super Jump: Automatically cause both players to swap places through a Super Jump.\n\nOnly five stages are playable in Battle Dojo:\n\n- Arowana Mall\n\n- Blackbelly Skatepark\n\n- Saltspray Rig\n\n- Urchin Underpass (Unchanged from the modifications in 2.0.0)\n\n- Walleye Warehouse\n\nThere are eight weapons available in Battle Dojo. The player will be equipped with gear based on the weapon they choose, as shown in the following table.\n\n- Battle Dojo promotional image.\n\n- Logo that appears on the balloons.\n\n- English website button\n\n- Choosing weapons in the Dojo.\n\n- Connecting a controller.\n\n- Choosing a Classic Controller type\n\n- A Wii U GamePad and four Wii U Pro Controllers, visible inside the Battle Dojo building.\n\n- The pre-2.0.0 Urchin Underpass in the Battle Dojo during a Splatfest.\n\n- An Inkling affected by a Disruptor in the Battle Dojo.\n\n- Battle Dojo results screen as seen on the GamePad.\n\n- Multiple Pro Controllers and a Wii U GamePad can be seen inside the Battle Dojo hanging on the wall. There are three white controllers, a black controller and a white GamePad on the left side and two black controllers on the right side.\n\n- Battle Dojo matches can also be played with a combination of the Wii U Pro Controller or Wii Classic Controller attached to a Wii Remote with MotionPlus, which is hinted at in the Sunken Scroll 26, pictured right. This allows the player using the controller to have motion controls. To perform this, the player must hold down on  and , and press  and , as described on Squid Research Lab.\n\n- The playable Inklings in the Battle Dojo are based on those seen in various pieces of official art.\n\n- During a Splatfest, all the stages in the Battle Dojo were switched to nighttime along with the Squid Sisters Splatfest theme Ink Me Up.\n\n- Stages that were added to the game through updates were not added to this mode.\nUsing hacks, one can load every stage into Battle Dojo, and each player would spawn where the spawn points would be in multiplayer, but no balloons or crates would spawn anywhere.\n\n- Using hacks, one can load every stage into Battle Dojo, and each player would spawn where the spawn points would be in multiplayer, but no balloons or crates would spawn anywhere.\n\n- The Urchin Underpass stage never received the changes from version 2.0.0 as the multiplayer stage did.\n\n- In Splatoon 3, the Shoal in Inkopolis Plaza is in the same spot as the Battle Dojo was in originally.\n\n- Using hacks, one can load every stage into Battle Dojo, and each player would spawn where the spawn points would be in multiplayer, but no balloons or crates would spawn anywhere."
