Later on during E3 2018, a  launch trailer was shown after the conclusion of the final round of the Splatoon 2 World Championship 2018 Finals, in which the mode was revealed to release the following day. The Octoling Girl, Octoling Boy, and Octoling Octopus amiibo were also revealed to be releasing at a later date.[4] The three amiibo were later released on 7 November 2018 in Japan and Europe, on 9 November 2018 in Oceania, and on 7 December 2018 in North America.\n\nA bundle containing both Splatoon 2 and the Octo Expansion, titled Splatoon 2 + Octo Expansion, is available on Nintendo eShop. A physical version of Splatoon 2 with the Octo Expansion included was exclusively released in Japan on 8 October 2021.[5]\n\nOn 22 April 2022, the Octo Expansion was added to the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription.\n\nThe Octo Expansion was revealed by a  trailer that was shown in the 8 March 2018 Nintendo Direct. At the time of release, the trailer offered little explanation for the identities of the new characters and events shown in it, but revealed the inclusion of Octolings as playable characters.\n\nNasty Majesty by Off the Hook plays throughout the trailer. The trailer is edited to reveal new elements and characters in time with the emphatic record scratch parts of the song. Initially presented as surveillance footage, the trailer begins with Agent 8 awaking within the Abandoned Station, then boarding a subway car; as they slowly walk from one car to the next, the characters encountered in the mode are shown one by one. In one train car, an assortment of denizens of the deep is suddenly replaced with Sanitized Octolings.\n\nThe Player Settings screen used in the mode is then shown, followed by cutscene footage of the Abandoned Station, then the turnstyle mechanic. Gameplay footage of A05 Fake Plastic Station, B12 Brute Rollup Station, C11 Abracadabra Station, A07 Maverick Station, H02 Ballercise Station, G09 B05 Wack 8-Ball Station, I05 B08 Righteous Rails Station, and one of the thang stations is then shown in quick succession. A brief snippet of the cutscenes from the finale is then shown, with Agent 8 reaching the surface, followed by footage of Octolings in Inkopolis Square who then spawn at the start of a battle in the Reef. The trailer ends with Marina singing without instrumentation, as Agent 8 sleeps on the same station floor seen at the beginning. The surveillance screen footage presentation returns, and the DLC's logo is revealed.\n\nThe player takes the role of Agent 8, an Octoling with amnesia who finds themself in a strange subway station called the Deepsea Metro connected to a series of research facilities deep underground. As the game starts, the Octoling wakes up to see Cap'n Cuttlefish ready to attack them before he stops, seeing that they do not have a weapon with them and that they are stranded in an unknown location, and he decides on a truce. Cuttlefish informs the Octoling that they and Agent 3 were fighting in Octo Valley before \"someone\" attacked them, with Agent 3 having gone missing. He then realizes that the Octoling lost their memories of who they are when they hit the ground and asks if they remember anything, which prompts the customization of the player's Octoling. Cap'n Cuttlefish then notes that the Octoling was humming the Calamari Inkantation while unconscious, concluding that they may be one of the Octarians whose \"souls were etched\" upon hearing the song during Agent 3's battle with DJ Octavio two years prior.\n\nAfter finding a way through a seemingly abandoned area, Agent 8 and Cap'n Cuttlefish come across Central Station, an empty platform with a telephone ringing. As the Octoling answers the Telephone, it identifies them as applicant 10,008; deeming the name too long, Cap'n Cuttlefish decides to give them the name \"Agent 8\" for short. The Telephone tells Agent 8 that they would want to go to the \"promised land\" so they can be free, but to do so, they must collect four \"thangs\". It provides them with a CQ-80 and CQ Card to help them before ending its speech, and a train then arrives and stops for Agent 8 and Cap'n Cuttlefish. Inside, they meet C.Q. Cumber, the conductor of the train, who explains the functions of the CQ-80 and the CQ Points system. Shortly afterwards, Pearl and Marina of Off the Hook unintentionally make contact with the two from Mount Nantai via Cap'n Cuttlefish's communication device, and they offer to help them escape to the surface.\n\nAgent 8 completes tests in the stations and collects the four thangs. After they collect the third thang, Cap'n Cuttlefish decides to create a missing poster for Agent 3 that he then places on the Telephone, asking Agent 8 to help remind him of Agent 3's appearance, allowing the player to customize it. After Agent 8 collects the fourth thang, the Telephone cryptically asks whether they are \"ready to ascend to a higher plane of existence\" and \"willing to become something greater than yourself\", before assembling the thangs to open a door that it claims to lead to the promised land. However, when Agent 8 and Cap'n Cuttlefish enter, it turns out to be a trap: the thangs were parts for a giant blender that the Telephone now plans to use to render them into raw material.\n\nBefore the blender can turn on, Marina activates a distress signal from Agent 8's CQ-80, prompting Agent 3 (using the appearance determined by the player earlier) to smash through the ceiling and destroy the blender. Agent 3 lands on the ground unconscious, but drops their employee-model CQ-80, which Marina can use to help them reach the surface. Agent 8 Super Jumps out through the hole Agent 3 made in the ceiling, beginning a lengthy escape as they climb towards the surface and manage to get an energy core to power an elevator. During this time, the Telephone recovers and brainwashes Agent 3. Upon reaching the elevator, Agent 8 is intercepted by Agent 3, accompanied by a tied-up Cap'n Cuttlefish. Agent 8 defeats Agent 3, ending the brainwashing and rendering them unconscious again, and finally reaches the surface.\n\nPearl and Marina arrive in a helicopter to airlift Agent 8, Cap'n Cuttlefish, and the still-unconscious Agent 3 to safety, but the facility that Agent 8 just climbed through proceeds to rise from the water, revealed to be a statue of a human, with the Telephone in its eye. The Telephone introduces itself as Commander Tartar, an AI created 12,000 years ago by a professor to pass on human knowledge to the next intelligent species. It reveals that it has judged Inklings and Octarians as unworthy of receiving its knowledge and activates the NILS Statue, the mouth of which contains a weapon to destroy and recreate life on Earth, fueled by the blended raw material of the successful test subjects that it seeks to use to create \"perfect\" life. Marina quickly analyzes the statue and learns it is solar-powered, so she deploys her prototype hyperbombs on its body that Agent 8 detonates to cover it in ink, stopping it from charging. Tartar attempts to fire the weapon anyway, but Pearl counteracts the blast with her Princess Cannon, powered by her loud voice, which destroys Tartar and the statue. With the world saved, Pearl and Marina hug, Cap'n Cuttlefish celebrates, and Agent 3 wakes up. Agent 8 watches and smiles at them, finally free on the surface. As group looks out to Inkopolis in the distance (with the remains of the NILS Statue visible in the water), Cap'n Cuttlefish presses a button on the CQ-80 and the credits play. As the credits finish, Agent 8 looks back at the player and smiles at them. Off the Hook returns to Inkopolis Square, dropping off Agent 8 there as well.\n\nWhen Agent 8 returns to the Deepsea Metro, C.Q. Cumber tells them that the train is still functioning despite the end of Kamabo Co.'s operations. He explains that they can now collect mem medals and use the vending machine at Central Station. Cap'n Cuttlefish informs Agent 8 that Agent 3 went out on patrol, and he wished to check on the denizens of the deep for a while longer.\n\nAfter Agent 8 completes every test without using Marina's hacks, the eighth locker in Central Station opens. By interacting with it, Agent 8 has an imaginary battle with their \"Inner Agent 3\" as Calamari Inkantation plays, with the appearance of the arena based on that of the final battle from Octo Valley. Upon winning, they are rewarded with the Golden Toothpick that was in the locker.\n\nThe Octo Expansion adds a new single-player campaign consisting of 80 levels. Off the Hook supports Agent 8 from above ground and their help can be used to skip missions that are too difficult.\n\nThe first station has the Telephone, where Agent 8 learns the details on how to escape the Deepsea Metro. The Telephone also provides Agent 8 with the CQ-80 device (a flat controller shaped like a submarine), used to navigate the underground; and a CQ Card, which is used to store CQ Points. C.Q. Cumber will issue an initial 1000 CQ Points to start.\n\nEntering each mission costs a set amount of points, for either one, three, or five lives. The player can then choose between multiple challenges, each with a different weapon set. Depending on the weapon set chosen, a different amount of points is awarded (harder sets provide bigger rewards). Players enter the actual level by pressing  at the turnstyle.\n\nLives are lost not only from being splatted but also by failing to comply with certain test conditions. If the player fails to complete the test's conditions to pass, an inflatable balloon of ink attached to Agent 8's ink tank will explode and splat them in the process.\n\nIf the player loses all of their lives, they may continue from the last checkpoint with all lives returned by paying more points, return to the station for free (but still having to pay to re-enter the level), abandon the level and return to the subway, or ask for help from Off the Hook to skip the level. Off the Hook can only help Agent 8 skip a level if they fail at least twice. When prompted to ask for help, it requires the regular fee to auto-pass the level, wherein Marina hacks into Kamabo's mainframe to trick it into thinking Agent 8 passed. The resulting mem cake will be gray, with only the quote \"Your guess is as good as mine.\" However, if pressed to ask for help, the player can press X to \"Tough it Out\" and continue to play the level as normal. If skipped, the mem cake of that level will not be collected, barring players from certain rewards until they have completed the station properly.\n\nIf a player finds themselves with less than 100 CQ Points after losing all of their lives, a game over screen will appear instead of a continue screen. The player will then return to the Metro, where Pearl will take money from her father and Marina will convert it into CQ points, transferring 3000 CQ Points to Agent 8. However, the player will be in debt, which can be repaid through Cap'n Cuttlefish. The player cannot unlock the Inner Agent 3 if they have debt (though can still access it if they gain debt after already unlocking it).\n\nThe normal Octarians from Octo Canyon are replaced with Sanitized Octarians, which are a distinctive shade of sickly green. Enemy Octolings can use more main weapons and special weapons, previously only seen in online multiplayer modes. For example, in the first test, an enemy Octoling can use an Inkjet. A select number of levels are also special only, meaning Agent 8's special bar never goes down.\n\nSome tests have Agent 8 go against a team of four Sanitized Octolings, in the style of ranked modes. The time limit is always five minutes and Agent 8 has unlimited lives until the time limit ends.\n\nAfter completing the story, players can play as a male or female Octoling in multiplayer gameplay and customize them just like Inklings. Gear and weapons will be shared between the characters in the same account.\n\nA  short gameplay video of one of the missions was published on 30 April 2018. It shows a female Agent 8 on a mission requiring her to defeat a set of Sanitized Octotroopers, Octosnipers and Octocommanders within two minutes. This video also marks the first appearance of canisters similar to the special weapon canisters from Octo Canyon, as well as metallic briefcases. Both are marked with the same logo as the CQ-80 and the CQ Card, unlike the Octo Canyon canisters that show the Ammo Knights logo.\n\nThe objectives of the missions were revealed in a short gameplay video of F04 C05 Stamped-Up Station. It is a set of three floating pieces of a goal that must be covered in ink to be activated and be touched for the level to be completed. There are also smaller posts that emit red beacons that function the same as Mini Zapfish.\n\nAfter three of the thangs are found, Cap'n Cuttlefish will decide to make a \"missing\" poster for Agent 3, asking Agent 8 what they look like. This determines Agent 3's gender, skin color, and eye color.\n\nDuring the escape, if Agent 8 dies five times in a phase, their \"Skip Charge\" will be filled and will be allowed to skip the phase. If so, the sounds of a Splashdown and a Sting Ray can be heard and there will be a simple transitional phrase on the screen, stating that Agent 8 got past the phase. In the final boss, it will be instantly filled after one failed attempt.\n\nWhen Agent 8 returns to the Deepsea Metro, they will be able to use the vending machine in Central Station to exchange 15,000 credits for an item and go around other stations to claim mem medals to be exchanged for the vending machine. The vending machine has more variety than the Ammo Knights Enhancifier, having the chance of getting more than one drink ticket, upgraded food tickets, cash, ability chunks, and credits. The items range from getting every type of drink ticket to even getting tens of thousands in cash.\n\nCompleting all missions with each challenge cleared and defeating the secret boss will change the background of the CQ-80 to one featuring the Kamabo Corporation logo and a stamp with the Inkling text saying \"COMPLETE\" on the bottom of the map.\n\nThere is a mandatory tutorial station, Abandoned Station.\n\nIf a station has dual IDs, the later letter in alphabetical order takes precedence, as inferred by the cost of its test fee and the way two lines overlap each other. Stations with double circles denote where thangs are. Line A is the only line that has a station with 00 as its number, the Central Station.\n\nA00 Central Station\n\nA01 Gnarly Rails Station\n\nA02 Far-Out Station\n\nA03 Wassup 8-Ball Station\n\nA04 Roll Out Station\n\nA05 Fake Plastic Station\n\nA06 Bounce with Me Station\n\nA07 Maverick Station\n\nA08 Bumpin' 8-Ball Station\n\nB01 Wassup 8-Ball Station\n\nB02 Poppin' Fresh Station\n\nB03 Spin Docto Station\n\nB04 Rad Ride Station\n\nB05 Wack 8-Ball Station\n\nB06 Notorious Station\n\nB07 Fly 8-Ball Station\n\nB08 Righteous Rails Station\n\nB09 Grab & Go Station\n\nB10 Ink 'n' Slide Station\n\nB11 Tubular 8-Ball Station\n\nB12 Brute Rollup Station\n\nB13 Phat Splatz Station\n\nB14 Breakdance Station\n\nB15 Ink from Above Station\n\nB16 Pop Rock Station\n\nC01 Radical Rails Station\n\nC02 Shrinky Ink Station\n\nC03 Bumpin' 8-Ball Station\n\nC04 Move It Move It Station\n\nC05 Stamped-Up Station\n\nC06 Bust 'n' Move Station\n\nC07 Totally 8-Ball Station\n\nC08 Right Round Station\n\nC09 Bodacious 8-Ball Station\n\nC10 McFly Station\n\nC11 Abracadabra Station\n\nC12 Matchmaker Station\n\nC13 Smash & Dash Station\n\nC14 Stick 'n' Move Station\n\nD01 Ink from Above Station\n\nD02 One-Shot Station\n\nD03 Slap Bracelet Station\n\nD04 Mad Props Station\n\nD05 All That 8-Ball Station\n\nD06 Radical Rails Station\n\nD07 Targetbuster Station\n\nD08 Girl Power Station\n\nD09 Goose Station\n\nD10 Labyrinth Station\n\nD11 Ink & Watch Station\n\nE01 No Whammy Station\n\nE02 Bust & Run Station\n\nE03 Don't Ralph Station\n\nE04 Heinous 8-Ball Station\n\nE05 Hypercolor Station\n\nE06 Swass 8-Ball Station\n\nE07 Iceman Station\n\nE08 Da Bomb Station\n\nE09 Squee-G Funk Station\n\nE10 Cratebuster Station\n\nE11 Bodacious Rotation Station\n\nE12 Drop the Bass Station\n\nF01 Drop the Bass Station\n\nF02 Slow Ride Station\n\nF03 Pop Star Station\n\nF04 Stamped-Up Station\n\nF05 Popalicious Station\n\nF06 Duh-Oh Station\n\nF07 Matchmaker Station\n\nF08 Jump Station\n\nF09 Bring It Station\n\nF10 Cubular Station\n\nF11 Whack-Fu Station\n\nG01 Toastmaster Station\n\nG02 Hasta La Vista Station\n\nG03 House Party Station\n\nG04 Ink 'n' Slide Station\n\nG05 Bustalicious Station\n\nG06 Gnarly Rails Station\n\nG07 Ride with Me Station\n\nG08 Freakazoid Station\n\nG09 Wack 8-Ball Station\n\nG10 Iceman Station\n\nH01 Slap Bracelet Station\n\nH02 Ballercise Station\n\nH03 Sweet Ride Station\n\nH04 Shooter McStation\n\nH05 Ink It Station\n\nH06 Break & Bounce Station\n\nH07 Cool Your Jets Station\n\nI01 Toastmaster Station\n\nI02 Dinky Ink Station\n\nI03 No Whammy Station\n\nI04 Can't Touch This Station\n\nI05 Righteous Rails Station\n\nI06 All Eyez Station\n\nI07 Ride with Me Station\n\nI08 Radio Station\n\nI09 Poppin' Fresh Station\n\nJ01 Cool Your Jets Station\n\nJ02 Matchmaster Station\n\nJ03 Girl Power Station\n\nJ04 Footloose Station\n\nJ05 Stick 'n' Move Station\n\nJ06 Ink & Watch Station\n\nJ07 Outrageous Station\n\nJ08 Whack-Fu Station\n\n01.

(link to file)\n\nThe full version of the Octo Expansion trailer song, called Nasty Majesty, was performed during Off the Hook's live concert at NicoNico Chokaigi 2018.[3]\n\nOn 21 May 2018, a new character was revealed, a sanitized Octoling DJ called Dedf1sh.[6] According to Nintendo, Dedf1sh was a DJ with a promising future in the music world. During their[a] search for inspiration, they came across a deep-sea testing facility and became sanitized. Despite this, they kept up their career as a DJ, and their music is heard throughout the facility.\n\nThe number eight is a recurring theme in the Octo Expansion, referencing the number of limbs an octopus has.\n\n- Agent 8 (subject No. 10008) is the main protagonist.\n\n- The name of the DLC (Splatoon 2: Octo Expansion) has eight syllables.\n\n- The CQ-80 device is used to navigate the Deepsea Metro.\n\n- The Octo Expansion has eighty levels. Additionally, there are eight escape phases; if these are counted, the total number of levels is 88.\n\n- The tubes on the sides of the checkpoints resemble the number eight.\n\n- Each line of the mem cake poems has exactly eight syllables.\n\n- Some levels require the player to push an 8-ball to a goal.\nThe song #8 regret plays during these levels.\n\n- The song #8 regret plays during these levels.\n\n- Some levels require the player to collect eight data points.\n\n- If the player goes through the lines in alphabetical order, the last thang is on the eighth line.\n\n- After the final boss fight, when Pearl uses the Princess Cannon against the NILS Statue, the turf covered for the \"Good Guys\" goes up to 888.8%.\n\n- The five music tracks rewarded for completion of the Octo Expansion are numbered from 80 to 84 in Squid Beatz 2 (these numberings do not follow linearly from the songs immediately before, as the other songs only number up to 57).\nAdditionally, the Octoling amiibo reward three addtional tracks, which, while linearly numbered with non-Octo Expansion songs, add to a total of eight Octo Expansion songs in Squid Beatz 2.\n\n- Additionally, the Octoling amiibo reward three addtional tracks, which, while linearly numbered with non-Octo Expansion songs, add to a total of eight Octo Expansion songs in Squid Beatz 2.\n\n- The locker in A00 Central Station that is used to enter the Inner Agent 3 battle is locker 8.\n\n- In the Diaphragm Phase of the escape, eight locks need to be unlocked to get to the energy core.\n\n- The Squid Bumpers that appear at the entrances to the missions have eight stubs at the base, as opposed to those in the test range which have ten.\n\n- In Marina's chat room, the file for #$@%* Dudes Be #$@%* Sleepin' (Live) is named \"rec_bow_down_ball_gig08.mp8\" (\"mp8\" being a reference to mp3).\n\n- There are eight main characters: Agent 8, Cap'n Cuttlefish, Pearl, Marina, Agent 3, C.Q. Cumber, Iso Padre, and Commander Tartar.\n\n- When the player completes eight mem cake sets, Iso Padre mentions that eight is \"an important number\".\n\n- The DLC was announced on 8 March 2018, and released in 2018. Additionally, the Japan-exclusive physical version of Splatoon 2 featuring the Octo Expansion was released on 8 October 2021.\n\n- In Dedf1sh's album art, they use a series of turntables that each have the number 8 on them and eight buttons.\n\n- Several numbers are skipped in the numbering of Dedf1sh's songs, namely 3, 7, 10, 15, 17, and 18. When adding the numbers from the title of each song and then dividing the total by the number of Dedf1sh songs in the Octo Expansion (in other words, taking the average of the numbers used plus an extra 0 to represent Splattack! (Octo)), the result is eight.\n\n- The song #8 regret plays during these levels.\n\n- Additionally, the Octoling amiibo reward three addtional tracks, which, while linearly numbered with non-Octo Expansion songs, add to a total of eight Octo Expansion songs in Squid Beatz 2.\n\nThe Splatoon manga adapted the Octo Expansion into the Octo arc. It lasted from chapters 24 to 28.\n\nIn the Octo arc, Goggles wakes up in the Deepsea Metro, after being washed away during his \"part-time job\". He is greeted by Eight, who saves him from some Sanitized Octarians. He meets up with Cap'n Cuttlefish.\n\nOcto Expansion was developed by Production Group No. 5 of Nintendo Entertainment Planning & Development. The game was directed by Yusuke Amano, Seita Inoue, and Shintaro Sato.\n\n- The Octo Expansion features many references to 1980s and 1990s pop culture (station names and subtitles) and the vaporwave style (visuals and audio).\n\n- The Studio Octophones and Octo Layered LS obtained by purchasing the Octo Expansion are a reference to the initial Splatoon Global Testfire, where players who pre-purchased Splatoon during the event were given the Studio Headphones and a special squid-themed layered shirt.\n\n- Outside the cafÃ© Spyke is located in (near the Deepsea Metro's entrance), an employee model CQ-80 and two CQ cards can be seen.\n\n- Only 14 levels are strictly required to be completed to reach the end of the Octo Expansion (Abandoned Station, A05 Fake Plastic Station, the four thang stations, and the eight phases of the escape sequence), but all routes that the player can take to reach the four thangs require at least two additional levels to be completed, so the minimum number of levels that must be completed to reach the ending is 16.\n\n- The Octo Expansion is the only single-player mode in the Splatoon series where the credits song (Into the Light) is not introduced in a special news broadcast before or after the credits roll.\n\n- This is the only single-player mode in which the player cannot buy upgrades of any kind."
