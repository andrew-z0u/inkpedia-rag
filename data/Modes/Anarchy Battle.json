  "content": "Anarchy Battleâ€‹\n\nAnarchy Battle is one of the multiplayer mode categories in Splatoon 3, acting as the replacement for Ranked Battles from previous games. There are two versions of the mode available: Open and Series.\n\nIn both Open and Series Anarchy Battles, the player gains bonus XP and cash when they KO the opposing team. However, rank points are unaffected by a KO or the end score, only being determined by whether the player won or lost.\n\n- 1 Description\n\n- 2 Anarchy Battle (Series)\n\n2.1 Rank-Up Battle\n2.2 Point costs and gains\n\n2.2.1 Wins needed to break even on rank points\n\n\n2.3 Streaks\n2.4 Series Weapon Power\n\n2.4.1 Gallery\n\n- 2.1 Rank-Up Battle\n\n- 2.2 Point costs and gains\n\n2.2.1 Wins needed to break even on rank points\n\n- 2.2.1 Wins needed to break even on rank points\n\n- 2.3 Streaks\n\n- 2.4 Series Weapon Power\n\n2.4.1 Gallery\n\n- 2.4.1 Gallery\n\n- 3 Anarchy Battle (Open)\n\n- 4 Ranks\n\n- 5 List of modes\n\n- 6 Stage schedule\n\n6.1 Splatoon 3\n6.2 Seasonal resets\n\n- 6.1 Splatoon 3\n\n- 6.2 Seasonal resets\n\n- 7 Quotes\n\n- 8 Badges\n\n- 9 Gallery\n\n- 10 Names in other languages\n\n10.1 Internal names\n\n- 10.1 Internal names\n\n- 11 References\n\n- 2.1 Rank-Up Battle\n\n- 2.2 Point costs and gains\n\n2.2.1 Wins needed to break even on rank points\n\n- 2.2.1 Wins needed to break even on rank points\n\n- 2.3 Streaks\n\n- 2.4 Series Weapon Power\n\n2.4.1 Gallery\n\n- 2.4.1 Gallery\n\n- 2.2.1 Wins needed to break even on rank points\n\n- 2.4.1 Gallery\n\n- 6.1 Splatoon 3\n\n- 6.2 Seasonal resets\n\n- 10.1 Internal names\n\nAnarchy Battle is played by up to eight people, each on their console. There are two teams of up to four players each, with each team being assigned its own ink color. These battles can last for five minutes, instead of the three-minute-long Turf Wars, although the battle can be shorter or longer depending on the outcome of the game. It features several modes and is accessible once a player hits Level 10, or if a player transferred Splatoon 2 save data on their Nintendo Switch to Splatoon 3. The modes included in this category generally require a higher level of strategy compared to Regular Battles, and wins and losses are counted toward players' ranks which are used for matchmaking. The modes featured in Anarchy Battle are the same previously featured in Ranked Battle, but feature different ranking systems.\n\nBattles played in Anarchy Battle (Series) are only able to be played solo, meaning that friends cannot join; players will be placed onto a random four-person team. To begin matchmaking, players will need to pay a certain amount of Rank Points to start the game series. The entry fee depends on the player's current rank.\n\nThe overall goal in these battles is to win five matches before losing three matches. Disconnecting adds one loss to that player's total. In the event of another player disconnecting in the first minute, the match will be aborted and not count for the remaining players; a disconnect later in the match will not count towards the losing team's total, but will still count as a win for the winning team. Points are awarded at the end of the series, regardless of whether the player achieved five victories or three defeats first. They are calculated as 1p for each silver medal, 5p for each gold medal, and then a varying number of points for each victory in the series. Medals from defeats will count towards the total but the defeat itself awards no points. The first victory is worth a number of points based on rank and each additional win in the same series is worth 5p more than the previous win.\n\nAs an example, a 5-2 Series at A+ Rank (40p Base Win Value) with 7 silver medals and 14 gold medals would yield a total of 327p: (40 + 45 + 50 + 55 + 60) + (7 * 1) + (14 * 5) = 327p.\n\nRank-Up Battles replace the Anarchy Series option when the player reaches a certain threshold of points in specific ranks, such as 1100p to rank-up from A+ to S. Like Anarchy Series, the player must wager points to enter them.\n\nUnlike regular Anarchy Series, the player only needs to win three matches to complete a Rank-Up Battle Series. If they succeed, they will be promoted, and their points will be reset. If they accumulate three losses, they will fail, losing all points paid to enter the Rank-Up Battle Series.\n\nPrior to the version 2.0.0 update, the costs to enter a series at A-, A, and A+ were 10 points less, and the costs to enter at S and S+ were 20 points less.\n\nStarting with version 6.0.0, players who win five total wins in a single Anarchy Battle Series entry receive a \"5 Wins in a Row\" marker, which displays as a small crown icon above their nametag. The crown icon is visible exclusively before a battle begins. Achieving another five-win streak in a separately entered Series increases the number beside the crown icon; initial crown icons are colored bronze, but change to silver or gold depending on the amount of streaks the player has achieved. Players will lose their streak marker if they lose three consecutive matches in a Series. Players will also lose their streak upon completing a rank up series, even if they win every game.\n\nDespite the official usage of terminology such as \"consecutive wins\" and \"wins in a row\" to describe the streak mechanic, which implies players must not lose any matches between wins, players may obtain the streak marker even if their Series contained losses, so long as they achieved five total wins.\n\nStarting with version 10.0.0, Series Weapon Power has been added to Anarchy Battle (Series) for Rank S and higher. Series Weapon Power is measured separately for each weapon. Players will be matched with others of similar power. A weapon's Series Weapon Power is the same for all four modes and resets at the start of a new season, with the highest value players have achieved recorded in SplatNet 3. Series Weapon Power for each weapon can be viewed on the Equip screen when checking a weapon's details.\n\n- Introduction screen in which all players of a team have streak crowns.\n\n- A bronze crown above a player's head, awarded to a player with two consecutive series wins.\n\n- A silver crown above a player's head, awarded to a player with five consecutive series wins.\n\n- A gold crown above a player's head, awarded to a player with ten consecutive series wins.\n\nAnarchy Battles played in Anarchy Battle (Open) can be played solo or with friends, meaning that players will either be placed onto a random four-person team, or players can form a team. If the team consists of three players or fewer, others who are playing solo will be added to the team to create a full squad. Teams will be matched by comparing the number of rank points of the player who has the least on the team. If battles are won, 20 points are awarded regardless of rank. If battles are lost, the amount of points lost increases at higher ranks, with a maximum of 13 points. Prior to version 10.0.0 a win was worth 8 points, and losses a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 5.\n\nBeginning in Sizzle Season 2023, playing Anarchy Battle (Open) with a team of 2-4 players for at least 5 battles will record Anarchy Power for that team, functioning similarly to League Power from League Battle in Splatoon 2. The current and highest power reached with the current team is recorded, as well as the highest power ever achieved with any team.\n\nRanks for Anarchy Battles are similar to those in Splatoon 2 before version 3.0.0. Players can achieve a maximum rank of S+, spanning from S+0 to S+50. X Battles became available in version 2.0.0. Players must be S+0 or above to play X Battle mode.\n\nStages and modes rotate every two hours, like Splatoon 2's Ranked Battles. For both Open and Series, each has one battle mode played on two maps at a time.\n\nAt the end of each season (which lasts three months), each player's rank will drop to two tiers below the highest rank they have achieved. For example, if a player's highest rank is A+, at the end of the season, they will drop to A-.[1] Players in ranks S+0 to S+9 will drop to S, and players S+10 to S+50 drop to S+0. If players want to keep their ability to play X Battles, they will need to achieve a rank of S+10 or greater. In version 8.0.0, an alternate condition was added for players who reach rank 1,000 or better on the X Battle leaderboards in any mode, granting them an Anarchy Battle rank of S+0 for the next season and maintaining their access to X Battles, regardless of the Anarchy Battle rank with which they ended the previous season.\n\nOur research has determined that there are four types of Anarchy Battles: Splat Zones, Tower Control, Rainmaker, and Clam Blitz. There are even a few twists for returning players, like the new checkpoint in Rainmaker! Press the  Button in the lobby and hit Rules for more info.\n\nWinning a certain amount of battles per Anarchy mode, or achieving certain Rank or streak milestones will reward the player with special badges that they can use on their Splashtag.\n\n- SplatNet 3 icon\n\n- Promotional image showing the two ranked modes available in X rank."
