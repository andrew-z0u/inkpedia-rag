  "content": "Regular Battle​\n\nRegular Battle is one of the multiplayer mode categories in the Splatoon series, alongside Ranked Battle/Anarchy Battle, Squad Battle/League Battle, and Private Battle.\n\nIn Splatoon, Splatoon 2, and Splatoon 3, Regular Battle is accessible from the beginning of the game and has no ranking system used for matchmaking, meaning it is more casual in nature. During Splatfests, it is replaced by Splatfest Battle.\n\n- 1 Modes\n\n- 2 Audio\n\n2.1 Splatoon\n\n2.1.1 Splatfest music\n\n\n2.2 Splatoon 2\n\n2.2.1 Splatfest music\n\n\n2.3 Splatoon 3\n\n2.3.1 Splatfest music\n\n- 2.1 Splatoon\n\n2.1.1 Splatfest music\n\n- 2.1.1 Splatfest music\n\n- 2.2 Splatoon 2\n\n2.2.1 Splatfest music\n\n- 2.2.1 Splatfest music\n\n- 2.3 Splatoon 3\n\n2.3.1 Splatfest music\n\n- 2.3.1 Splatfest music\n\n- 3 Gallery\n\n- 4 Names in other languages\n\n- 5 Notes\n\n- 6 References\n\n- 2.1 Splatoon\n\n2.1.1 Splatfest music\n\n- 2.1.1 Splatfest music\n\n- 2.2 Splatoon 2\n\n2.2.1 Splatfest music\n\n- 2.2.1 Splatfest music\n\n- 2.3 Splatoon 3\n\n2.3.1 Splatfest music\n\n- 2.3.1 Splatfest music\n\n- 2.1.1 Splatfest music\n\n- 2.2.1 Splatfest music\n\n- 2.3.1 Splatfest music\n\n- Turf War: The only mode playable in a Regular Battle.
