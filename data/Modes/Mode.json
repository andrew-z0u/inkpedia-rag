    "Modes are gameplay configurations available to the player. The Splatoon series features both online and offline modes, accessible from Inkopolis Plaza (in Splatoon), Inkopolis Square (in Splatoon 2), or Splatsville (in Splatoon 3), with the majority of online modes being accessible from the lobby.",
    "Online modes share a level system where Battle Points earned during matches add up to a new level. As the player's level gets higher, in-game characters will notice and will compliment the player on becoming more \"fresh\". As players level up, they unlock new weapons to purchase, new modes to play, etc. At Level 20, players can go to Spyke or Murch to add ability slots to gear or re-roll gear abilities for 30,000 cash or one Super Sea Snail. Additionally, players can receive a new piece of gear or weapon from Judd every five levels starting at Level 25 in Splatoon. In Splatoon 3, The current maximum level is Level 999, as of version 2.0.0 in Splatoon 2, the maximum level is Level 625, and in Splatoon, the maximum level is 50.",

    "Battle Dojo is a local two-player mode only appearing in Splatoon, with one player using the Wii U GamePad and the other using a separate controller, such as the Wii U Pro Controller, and the TV screen. Both players must attempt to pop balloons to reach thirty points. If the timer runs out before one player has reached thirty points, whoever has the most wins. Getting splatted will subtract points, which will vary depending on what position the player splatted was in. In the last minute of the battle, every balloon popped is worth double the points.",
