    "Big Run is an event mode in Splatoon 3. The mode was first announced in the Splatoon 3 Direct. Big Runs are limited-time events in which Salmonids invade a stage normally used by Inklings and Octolings for Turf War and Anarchy Battles, turning it into the only Salmon Run stage for the duration of the event. Starting with Chill Season 2022, Big Runs happen once per season, usually between two Splatfests.",
    "Big Run shifts follow the same pattern as in regular Salmon Run. Four players team up to battle oncoming Salmonids throughout three waves, splatting Boss Salmonids to acquire Golden Eggs and deposit them in the egg basket. In addition to appearing from the water of the flooded sections of the battle stage, Salmonids can now also spawn from large Gushers that burst open at the start of each normal and low tide wave. After the third wave, a King Salmonid may appear during an Xtrawave. The same rank system is used, with freelance and friend teams both available. The same bonuses are granted, with additional bonuses and superbonuses added to the bar. Additionally, a 1.2x multiplier is applied to Catalog Points earned from shifts during the event.",
    "Three different tide levels can occur on each wave. Unlike in normal Salmon Run, where normal tide and high tide always take place in the same location and low tide takes place elsewhere, the play area of Big Run changes differently on each map. On some maps, all three tide levels can have separate egg baskets. Big Run features the Known Occurrences of Rush, Fog, The Griller, and The Mothership (except on Undertow Spillway, where The Griller cannot occur). Cohock Charge, Goldie Seeking, Mudmouth Eruptions, and Giant Tornado are not available. The possibility of Rush and The Griller is still constrained by the wave's tide level, but each can appear in more than one of the playable locations on the map, unlike in normal Salmon Run, where they cannot appear in the low tide location.",
    "The Golden Egg total from a shift will count for the player's high score even if the team fails to complete all three waves, with Mr. Grizz indicating that he cares about the Golden Eggs more than he cares whether Splatsville is successfully defended from the Salmonid invasion.",
    "During the event period, Big Run replaces access to regular Salmon Run shifts[1] through the Grizzco lobby, similar to how Splatfest Battles restrict access to non-Splatfest Turf War battles and Anarchy Battles. Normal battles are still available, but the current Big Run stage is unavailable in any rotation until Big Run is over (however, this is not the case for 'repeat' Big Runs).",
    "At the announcement and starting times of Big Run, a warning and recruitment message is delivered by Deep Cut during the Anarchy Splatcast. During the event,  Splatsville, Inkopolis Plaza, and Inkopolis Square become foggy. The skies overhead turn dark pink and filled with storm clouds, with Grizzco helicopters flying overhead, and the background music is changed to an eerier tune played on violin (for Splatsville) or a synthesizer (for Inkopolis Plaza and Inkopolis Square, with separate ambient themes for both), and various noises coming from Salmonids can be heard. Promotional flyers for Big Run can be seen scattered across the place in each hub area as well. Inside Grizzco Industries, a warning light flashes, and the usual Grizzco lobby music is replaced by Bait & Click (Mutation), performed by Ï‰-3. When playing a shift, the battle stage's sky takes on the same appearance, and Bait & Click plays instead of Deluge Dirge or Frantic Aspic (other songs play as normal). Additionally, the Anarchy Splatcast theme is replaced during the event with a Grizzco Industries version.",
    "Players do not have to reach Level 4 to participate in Big Run, unlike normal Salmon Run. This is seen in the stage schedule in SplatNet 3, where it shows a banner reading, \"It's Big Run time! Grizzco hiring ANYONE!\"",
    "After the Grand Splatlands Bowl Big Run, there have been no new stages or rewards introduced from Big Run events due to the end of Splatoon 3's regular content updates. Instead, Big Runs were announced to be \"[continuing] for the time being\"[2], and have since begun returning in sequential order, with the same stages repeated alongside their associated rewards. In these 'repeat' Big Runs, some differences can be seen: the King Salmonid encounter is now always the Triumvirate, all rare weapons will be available as part of the random weapon selection instead of some events having set rare weapons only, and the stage used for the Big Run is no longer excluded from battle rotations.",
    "A special Big Run dubbed BIG Big Run was teased in the Sizzle Season 2024 announcement trailer.[3] During this special event, all previous stages where Big Run events took place were taken over by Salmonids; event participants were randomly sent to any of the available stages. A new Grizzco weapon, the Grizzco Roller, made its debut as the sole rare weapon available outside of Xtrawave. The Triumvirate, a team consisting of the three King Salmonids (Cohozuna, Horrorboros, and Megalodontia), was also introduced in this event, being fought in Xtrawaves, wherein players receive a random rare weapon and two special weapon uses. Fish scales obtained during an Xtrawave received a x3 Triumvirate bonus, which replaced the usual x2 scale bonus present in other Big Runs.",
    "BIG Big Run took place from 8 June 2024 to 10 June 2024, during which the six stages (Wahoo World, Inkblot Art Academy, Undertow Spillway, Barnacle & Dime, Um'ami Ruins, and Eeltail Alley) were absent from stage rotations in online battle modes. The stage selection for this event was referred to as \"Multiple Sites\" in in-game and SplatNet 3 rotation listings. The term \"BIG Big Run\" was only used in Anarchy Splatcast news dialogue and official social media posts; in mode selection and SplatNet 3 shift records, the event was referred to by the standard Big Run title.",
    "At the end of each Big Run event, exclusive locker decorations are awarded based on the highest team-wide Golden Egg total the player achieved in any one shift. Each Big Run has three fixed tiers of scores to aim for, which are announced at the start of a Big Run during the Anarchy Splatcast. Players who do not meet score thresholds still receive a basic version of the decoration for participating in at least one shift.",
    "Before version 6.0.0, scores were instead ranked relative to the high scores of all participating players, with the different decorations awarded to players whose high score was in the top 5%, top 20%, top 50%, or bottom 50% (participation) of scores.",
    "Additionally, starting from version 4.0.0, Big Run participants receive double fish scales after an Xtrawave. From version 8.0.0 onwards, all Xtrawaves of a Big Run face off against the Triumvirate, therefore rewarding players with triple fish scales instead.",
    "Badges are available for reaching each tier of high score in any Big Run event.",

    "- During the initial Big Run reveal, the sky in the footage was a dark red, matching the appearance of the sky during an Xtrawave. This was most likely a placeholder, as the sky was changed to pink in the second trailer.",
    "- In the background of a promotional image for Wahoo World, the \"seven rings\" mentioned in Splatoon 2's Sunken Scroll 17 can be seen in the sky, above an island. During its initial appearance, the rings themselves were not present in-game, though the lights coming from the seven rings were still visible; this was corrected during the BIG Big Run. The rings are much closer to the stage and more visible at Um'ami Ruins.\nThe Sunken Scroll's illustration also appears briefly in the Chill Season 2022 announcement trailer for a few frames at the beginning of the Big Run segment.",

However, three different tide levels are still indicated at the beginning of a wave, and the play area changes along with them.\nThe BIG Big Run introduced randomly selected stages, the Grizzco Roller, and the Triumvirate.\nThe Grand Splatlands Bowl was the only stage to debut during a Big Run, which featured Mr. Grizz's modifications of Big Shot launchers for delivering Golden Eggs alongside a unique music track called Double Clickbait for regular waves.",
    "- During the Undertow Spillway Big Run, the lighting on the inside of the helicopter was incorrectly applied, causing a small strip at the bottom of the screen to always appear fully lit. The same error was visible during the Barnacle & Dime Big Run, although less conspicuously. This was fixed during the BIG Big Run.",

    "- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Anarchy_Splatcast_Glitch_Barnacle_%26_Dime_Big_Run.mp4 Anarchy Splatcast glitch after the Barnacle & Dime Big RunFor certain players, the initial Anarchy Splatcast results after the Barnacle & Dime Big Run had ended were skipped. These players also received prizes that were not consistent with their high scores, indicating that the older percentage-based system utilized before the 6.0.0 update was still in use, despite the prize qualifications previously being shown to be different. The glitch was quickly acknowledged by Nintendo.[4] The version 6.0.1 update remedied this for some players, but not others; those affected were able to collect the correct rewards by entering the lobby after the 6.0.2 update, though they were allowed to keep the initial incorrect figures.\nDuring this time, each figure threshold was listed in the in-game help menu as \"0\" Golden Eggs.",
    "- The Eeltail Alley Big Run was the first to be held after Inkopolis Square was added. Several details were missing from the square during this time, including the origami crane statue, the sign over the entrance to the Shoal, the smartphone border on one of Deca Tower's screens, and the tortoise statue's neckband. This was fixed in 7.2.0, with the fixed version debuting in the BIG Big Run.",
    "- The repeat Undertow Spillway Big Run was the first to be held after the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2; however, Nintendo Switch players experienced more frequent slowdowns at higher hazard levels compared with updates prior to version 10.0.0, making the game far more difficult even if the Salmonids were brought under control.[8] These slowdown problems were corrected in version 10.0.1.",
    "- During the Grand Splatlands Bowl Big Run:\nThere are flashing sirens placed outside the entrance to the Grizzco building for all three hub areas.\nAdditional sirens can be seen attached to the tree in front of Inkopolis Plaza's Grizzco entrance, and the closest telephone pole to Inkopolis Square's Grizzco entrance.\nGrizzco flyers can be seen falling from the sky in front of all three Grizzco buildings.\nThe Grizzco lobby is decorated with party decorations (likely for the Grand Festival, which this Big Run takes place just a week before) and two scoreboards both showing how close they are to reaching each quota.\nThe song in the Grizzco lobby was changed to a Deep Cut version, with Shiver and Frye singing along to the main melody with Big Man accompanying. There are also drums and a whistle akin to Anarchy Poisons (Bird Mix) playing in the background as well.\nThis rendition can also be heard right outside of Splatsville's Grizzco building.",
    "- Due to a misconfiguration, some players' Anarchy Splatcast announcement for the Inkblot Art Academy Big Run on 8 March 2025 showed the reward and dialogue for Big Runs on Wahoo World instead."
