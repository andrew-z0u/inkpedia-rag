    "Tower Control is one of the four Ranked BattleÂ modes in the Splatoon series, alongside Splat Zones, Rainmaker, and Clam Blitz.",
    "Tower Control was unveiled during the 7 May 2015 Splatoon-themed Nintendo Direct. The release date of Tower Control was revealed on 30 June 2015.[1]",
    "It was added to Splatoon on 2 July 2015 at  02:00 UTC.",
    "The tower is a large blue cube with a pole on top, and a grate that creates an overhang surrounding the top surface. Its walls and top of the tower can be inked, but the pole and the grate can not. The height of the tower also varies depending on the map - it may be short, medium, or tall.",
    "In Tower Control, two teams of four players fight to control a central tower that moves through the stage along a predetermined path. The path is mirrored and goes towards each side of the team's territory. The tower starts at the center, and when a player rides on top of it, it begins moving towards the enemy territory. If at least one player from each team is standing on the tower, it stops moving. If the player(s) standing on the tower falls off the platform or gets splatted and an enemy player stands on the tower, the enemy team claims the tower, and it begins moving towards the enemy's checkpoints/goal. If five seconds have passed with no one standing on the tower, it begins moving back to its initial position.",
    "The player(s) on the tower are a constant target and must be defended by other teammates to maintain control. The match ends when one team rides the tower all the way to the opponent's finish mark, or if five minutes are up and overtime is done, the team who pushed the furthest wins. Overtime in this mode begins if the current losing team has control of the tower when the five minutes are up and finishes once that team loses control of the tower or takes the lead. A draw cannot happen and the game degrades a point for the team who reached second to the score.",
    "In Splatoon, the tower speeds up as more teammates ride it. The changes in speed are as follows:[2]",
    "Tower Control received a few tweaks in Splatoon 2. Checkpoints have been added along the path the tower takes, which count towards the tower's progress. When the tower reaches a checkpoint, it stops for a set period of time before continuing on as normal.[3] Once a checkpoint is cleared, the tower can pass through it again without stopping. If the tower reached a checkpoint and was interrupted, whether by enemy team interaction or five seconds have passed since the team left the tower, after three seconds of lost control, the checkpoint's timer refills. If the pushing team gained control back, the three seconds are reset and the checkpoint continues to be cleared.",
    "Additionally, the team that is in control of the tower gains a boost in special gauge filling speed, even if no one is riding it. Whichever team shows up as in control on top receives the boost. If neither team is in control, no one receives the boost.[Citation needed]",
    "In contrast to Splatoon, the tower no longer gains a general speed boost from having multiple players ride it. Instead, the number of players only affects the speed at which checkpoints are cleared.",
    "Tower Control appears in two of the tests in the Octo Expansion: Rad Ride Station at Snapper Canal and Sweet Ride Station at Starfish Mainstage. Both tests require Agent 8 to ride the tower past six checkpoints and defend it against multiple Sanitized Octolings. At the last checkpoint, a Sanitized Octoling Super Jumps onto the tower with a Splashdown and throw a Splash Wall down to try to drive Agent 8 off the tower. Agent 8 has unlimited lives and can only fail the test if five minutes run out.",
    "Unlike multiplayer, a launchpad appears near the player's spawn point, which Super Jumps Agent 8 directly onto the tower. If Agent 8 is splatted, only one Sanitized Octoling takes the tower.",
    "In the Octo Expansion, the logo on the side of the tower is replaced by the Kamabo Corporation logo.",
    "To help identify the tower's current position, a pillar made of rings of light shines from its position into the sky. Players can look up and around in order to locate the tower. The two goal spots and checkpoints have glowing lights from them.",
    "While the tower is moving, its path is shown around the stage, letting players know where it will go. The path lightly glows with the ink of the team that is currently in possession and the glow follows the path that the tower is taking.",
    "When not on the tower, the anchor Ranked Battle icon, seen throughout the stage is pointing towards the position of the tower. On the map, that icon is always visible. The path, goal, and checkpoints are not visible on the map.",
    "The score is measured by how far into enemy territory a team has ridden the tower.",
    "If a team manages to get the tower to the enemy goal spot, then that team wins the match and achieves a Knockout score. The other team gets no points.",
    "If the game timer runs out with the tower in a neutral state, the team that managed to reach the closest to their goal at any point during the match wins. If the game timer runs out and the tower is being controlled by the losing team, then the game goes into overtime until that team manages to takes the lead or until the status of the tower changes to either neutral or the winning team's control.[4]",
    "Overtime begins if the losing team (with a shorter distance traveled[note 1]) currently has control of the Tower. At this point, Overtime ends when:",
    "- The losing team reaches a farther distance with the Tower than the winning team, thereby giving the losing team the victory.",
    "- The winning team regains control of the Tower.\nTo retake the tower, the winning team must have one of its players on the tower when none of the losing team's players are on it.",
    "- The losing team loses control of the Tower.\nThis is marked by the indicator turning from the losing team's color to the neutral Ranked Battle symbol, and happens five seconds after the Tower being empty.",
    "Players' special gauges will fill automatically under certain conditions.",
    "- The special gauges of the team that controls the tower (regardless of lead) will fill at 4.5p per second.\nThe defending team's special gauges will not fill automatically, even if they are losing.",
    "- When the tower is in a neutral state, the special gauges of the losing team will fill at 2.25p per second.",
