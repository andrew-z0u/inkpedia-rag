    "Tableturf Battle is an in-universe collectible card game inspired by Turf War battles, but turn-based and designed for two players. Both players use the cards in their customizable decks to add ink patterns to a grid-like board, competing to have the most ink on the board by the end of the game. Tableturf Battle is popular in the Splatlands.",
    "In Splatoon 3, Tableturf Battle can be played at the Tableturf Battle Dojo in Splatsville, Inkopolis Plaza, or Inkopolis Square.",
    "Tableturf Battle was announced on 10 August 2022 during the Splatoon 3 Direct. It was released with the launch of Splatoon 3. Online Tableturf Battle was confirmed on 23 February 2023 to release with the version 3.0.0 update.",
    "Cards are the main collectible for Tableturf Battle, used to place ink patterns on the grid like stages. Each card is based on individual weapons, characters, enemies, gear brands and objects from Splatoon 3.",
    "A game lasts 12 turns. Each turn, working simultaneously, both players choose a card from a hand of four cards and decide where to place that card's ink pattern on the board. Players may also pass, discarding one card from their hand and gaining a Special Point.",
    "A card's ink pattern must be placed orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to spaces that already contain the player's ink. On a normal turn, it cannot overlap existing ink.",
    "If both players try to place their ink patterns in the same spot, one of two things happens:",
    "- If the two cards have different numbers, then the card with the larger ink pattern is placed first, and the card with the smaller ink pattern is placed second. The smaller pattern covers up the larger one.[2][3] However, Special Spaces can only be covered by other Special Spaces.",
    "- If the two cards have the same number, then both cards add their ink patterns to the board at the same time. Spaces where the patterns overlap become neutral walls and cannot be inked again. Special Spaces do not become walls unless both are on the exact same square.",
    "When a Special Space on the board has no empty spaces adjacent to it (including diagonally), the space begins to glow with a fiery effect. When this happens, the player that the space belongs to earns a Special Point. Special points can also be earned when passing turns.",
    "A player can spend Special Points to play a card as a Special Attack, allowing the card's ink pattern to be placed over existing ink (but not Special Spaces or Walls) and replace it. When a card is played as a Special Attack, its ink pattern must be placed orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to one of the player's own Special Spaces on the board.",
    "The player with more ink spaces on the board at the end of the game wins. However, a player who resigns always loses, regardless of how many ink spaces they have.",
    "There are 30 rivals to fight in Tableturf Battle, with 19 of them being available in the base game of Splatoon 3 and 11 unlocked through the Splatoon 3: Expansion Pass DLC. Each rival wields a unique deck of cards and comes in three difficulty rankings: Lv. 1, Lv. 2, and Lv. 3. When a new rival is unlocked, only Lv. 1 is available for the player to challenge. When the player has beaten a rival three times at a particular level, the next sequential level is unlocked.",
    "The rivals in the base game are mostly comprised of Splatsville locals and are unlocked as the player increases their Tableturf Rank. Rivals added through the Splatoon 3: Expansion Pass are comprised of multiple Inkopolis locals. Once unlocked, a rival is available at all times with seven exceptions during Splatfest.",
    "If the player attempts to challenge a character which has not been fully unlocked, the Staff will have special dialogue; attempting to challenge Acht in particular will result in unique dialogue from the Staff where she claims to be unfamiliar with them.",
    "Some player avatars holding a small spread of cards can be played against; they gather by groups of three to the right of Hotlantis and around the Battle Dojo. Each takes the form of a computer opponent using that player's deck. Beating them can award either 115, 130, or 150 points, as shown before challenging them. Opponents awarding 150 points have a much more aggressive playstyle.",
    "There are 15 stages, including 8 that were present at launch and 7 added in version 7.0.0.",
    "Players earn Tableturf Points at the end of each game. When fighting computer-controlled opponents, 40 points are awarded for a loss or draw, while 100, 115, or 130 points are awarded for a win against a rival from the Tableturf Battle Dojo, depending on the rival's level. When winning against a computer-controlled Inkling or Octoling challenged in the plaza, 115, 130 or 150 points can be awarded. This value is fixed for each player that appears, seemingly at random.  No points are awarded for resigning (giving up).",
    "In online battles, by fighting other players in the Lobby or the Shoal, each player instead earns Tableturf Points based on the number of spaces of their color at the end of a match, capping out at 100. This is true regardless of the outcome of a match, and also applies if a player resigns from the battle.",
    "At certain point thresholds, the player's Tableturf Rank increases, allowing access to new opponents and unlocking new Tableturf Battle stages (for use when testing out decks in the editor), as well as badges for Splashtag and emote options.",
    "With the version 4.0.0 update increasing the Tableturf Rank limit, players earn 20 card bits every fifth rank after reaching Tableturf Rank 50. At every 100th rank and at Rank 999, a fresh card pack will be received instead.",

    "- Although Cuttlefish appears in his dried squid form during Tableturf Battles, his icon in the rival menu shows his humanoid appearance. This is likely to avoid spoilers for Return of the Mammalians, which must be completed—along with reaching the Rank 38—to unlock him.\nAdditionally, his Splashtag depicts his dried squid form, making him the only rival with two icons.",
    "- There are several Tableturf rivals that can change in appearance based on differing circumstances.\nDuring Splatfests, Baby Jelly, Cool Jelly, and Aggro Jelly have their bodies colored to the teams that Shiver, Frye, and Big Man are representing, respectively, showing they are backing those teams.\nLi'l Judd wears a headset microphone after completing Return of the Mammalians (which can be seen both when he is challenged in Tableturf Battle or when he is judging Turf War or Anarchy Battles).\nJelonzo wears one of four different outfits depending on the day of the week, just like when visited at Jelly Fresh.\nSimilar to Jelonzo, Fred Crumbs cycles between four different pairs of shoes depending on the day of the week, like when visited him at Shrimp Kicks. However, since he is sitting in front of a table, it is not possible for the player to see this without camera hacks.\nAs with Jelonzo and Fred Crumbs, Jelfonzo wears one of six different outfits depending on the day of the week, like when visited at Ye Olde Cloth Shoppe."
