  "content": "Splatfest Battle is a mode exclusively available during Splatfest events in the Splatoon series. It is similar to Regular Battle and features a special version of Turf War that takes place at night. Each match is three minutes long, without the possibility of Overtime.\n\nDuring Splatfests, no other 4v4 modes are available; Salmon Run or Salmon Run Next Wave are the only other accessible multiplayer modes. Splatoon 3 introduced Tricolor Battle, a mode that is made available alongside Splatfest Battle halfway through each Splatfest event.\n\n- 1 Release history\n\n- 2 Description\n\n2.1 Splatoon\n2.2 Splatoon 2\n2.3 Splatoon 3\n\n- 2.1 Splatoon\n\n- 2.2 Splatoon 2\n\n- 2.3 Splatoon 3\n\n- 3 Modes\n\n3.1 Splatfest Battle (Normal) and Splatfest Battle (Open)\n3.2 Splatfest Battle (Pro)\n\n- 3.1 Splatfest Battle (Normal) and Splatfest Battle (Open)\n\n- 3.2 Splatfest Battle (Pro)\n\n- 4 10x, 100x and 333x Battles\n\n4.1 Splatoon 2\n\n4.1.1 Announcements\n\n\n4.2 Splatoon 3\n\n4.2.1 Conch Clash\n4.2.2 Splatfest Floats\n4.2.3 Deep Cut announcements\n\n- 4.1 Splatoon 2\n\n4.1.1 Announcements\n\n- 4.1.1 Announcements\n\n- 4.2 Splatoon 3\n\n4.2.1 Conch Clash\n4.2.2 Splatfest Floats\n4.2.3 Deep Cut announcements\n\n- 4.2.1 Conch Clash\n\n- 4.2.2 Splatfest Floats\n\n- 4.2.3 Deep Cut announcements\n\n- 5 Splatfest Rank and rewards\n\n- 6 Splatfest team names\n\n- 7 Previous systems\n\n7.1 Splatoon 2\n\n7.1.1 Splatfest Battle (solo)\n7.1.2 Splatfest Battle (team)\n\n\n7.2 Splatoon 3\n\n- 7.1 Splatoon 2\n\n7.1.1 Splatfest Battle (solo)\n7.1.2 Splatfest Battle (team)\n\n- 7.1.1 Splatfest Battle (solo)\n\n- 7.1.2 Splatfest Battle (team)\n\n- 7.2 Splatoon 3\n\n- 8 Badges\n\n- 9 Music\n\n9.1 Splatoon\n9.2 Splatoon 2\n9.3 Splatoon 3\n\n- 9.1 Splatoon\n\n- 9.2 Splatoon 2\n\n- 9.3 Splatoon 3\n\n- 10 Gallery\n\n- 11 Names in other languages\n\n11.1 Translation notes\n\n- 11.1 Translation notes\n\n- 12 References\n\n- 2.1 Splatoon\n\n- 2.2 Splatoon 2\n\n- 2.3 Splatoon 3\n\n- 3.1 Splatfest Battle (Normal) and Splatfest Battle (Open)\n\n- 3.2 Splatfest Battle (Pro)\n\n- 4.1 Splatoon 2\n\n4.1.1 Announcements\n\n- 4.1.1 Announcements\n\n- 4.2 Splatoon 3\n\n4.2.1 Conch Clash\n4.2.2 Splatfest Floats\n4.2.3 Deep Cut announcements\n\n- 4.2.1 Conch Clash\n\n- 4.2.2 Splatfest Floats\n\n- 4.2.3 Deep Cut announcements\n\n- 4.1.1 Announcements\n\n- 4.2.1 Conch Clash\n\n- 4.2.2 Splatfest Floats\n\n- 4.2.3 Deep Cut announcements\n\n- 7.1 Splatoon 2\n\n7.1.1 Splatfest Battle (solo)\n7.1.2 Splatfest Battle (team)\n\n- 7.1.1 Splatfest Battle (solo)\n\n- 7.1.2 Splatfest Battle (team)\n\n- 7.2 Splatoon 3\n\n- 7.1.1 Splatfest Battle (solo)\n\n- 7.1.2 Splatfest Battle (team)\n\n- 9.1 Splatoon\n\n- 9.2 Splatoon 2\n\n- 9.3 Splatoon 3\n\n- 11.1 Translation notes\n\nSplatfest Battles in Splatoon were revealed via the Splatfest Incoming! announcement trailer on 13 June 2015.  The mode was first available via Rice vs. Bread on 13 June 2015,  Cats vs. Dogs or Rock vs. Pop on 4 July 2015, with each event's availability depending on the player's region.\n\nSplatfest Battles were confirmed to return in Splatoon 2 via the Splatoon 2 Direct on 6 July 2017.[1] The mode was first available in the Splatoon 2 Splatfest World Premiere demo, released after the Direct presentation with the events happening on 15 July 2017; the events featured were Rock vs. Pop or Cake vs. Ice Cream depending on the player's region.\n\nSplatfest Battles were confirmed to return in Splatoon 3 via the Splatoon 3 Direct on 10 August 2022. The mode was first available in the Splatoon 3 Splatfest World Premiere demo with the Rock vs. Paper vs. Scissors event.\n\nAcross all games, the nighttime variant Turf War has been the only gameplay mode accessible via Splatfest Battle. Between updates and new installments, several Splatfest Battle mechanics have been added and updated, affecting gameplay as well as the calculation of each Splatfest event's final results.\n\nSplatfest Battle​\n\nIn Splatoon, Splatfest Battle was the sole online mode available during Splatfest events. Players did not have the option to queue into matches alongside members of their friend list. Largely the same as standard Turf War battles, Splatfest Battles featured nighttime lighting and fireworks.\n\nAlongside Popularity, the total Wins determined the winning side of a Splatfest by turning the percentage of the total theme votes and wins into points of the same amount.\n\nSplatfest Battle​\n\nIn Splatoon 2, from 1.1.0 to 4.0.0, Splatfest Battle was newly split into two mode options called Solo and Team. In Solo mode, the player queued into Splatfest Battle lobbies on their own, whereas in Team mode, the player could create a lobby similar to Private Battle wherein they could queue into a lobby with their Nintendo Switch friends before matching against opposite-Team players.\n\nThe teams that won the most battles in respective modes were rewarded with one point each. Alongside the Popularity, which also rewarded one point to the team with the most votes, the team with the most points won the Splatfest.\n\nFollowing version 4.0.0, the Splatfest Battle system was reworked into two new modes called Splatfest Battle (Normal) and Splatfest Battle (Pro); the option to matchmake with friends was only available in the Normal mode. Under the new system, points were calculated as players earned clout through winning Splatfest Battles; clout earned in Normal mode was counted separately from clout earned in Pro mode.[2]\n\nUnder the new system, instead of total wins, each team's total accumulated clout was added up into two point categories, depending on whether the clout was earned in Normal or Pro mode.\n\nSplatfest Battle​\n\nIn Splatoon 3, Splatoon 2's system returns through the modes Splatfest Battle (Open) and Splattfest Battle (Pro), with both modes being available for the entirety of a Splatfest. A new mode Tricolor Battle has been added, which is only available after the Halftime Report. Since the 7.0.0 update, Fizzbangs have been added as an additional mechanic exclusive to Splatfest Battle and Tricolor Battle.\n\nSplatfest Battle (Normal) allowed players to enter battles either solo or with friends by joining together in a private lobby before entering a match. Players from the same team, regardless of having grouped up beforehand or not, could stay in the same lobby if they choose the \"Continue\" option after the end of a match. Players from the opposite teams could not match up in the same lobby after a match, in contrast to the standard Turf War lobby system.\n\nSplatfest Battle (Open) functions identically to Splatoon 2's Splatfest Battle (Normal).\n\nSplatfest Battle (Pro) worked identically to how Solo mode worked before this version; the player could not team up with friends and was automatically matched with three other players on the same team. After each round, the player's Splatfest Power increased or decreased depending on the battle's outcome. The Top 100 players of each team with the highest power levels are displayed on SplatNet 2.\n\nSplatfest Battle (Pro) functions identically to how it did in Splatoon 2. The Top 100 players of each team with the highest power levels are displayed on SplatNet 3.\n\nStarting with Splatoon 2's 4.0.0 update, each Splatfest Battle match has a chance to randomly turn into a special[3] battle, wherein the Clout earned by the winning team is multiplied. When special battles occur, their related multiplier is revealed abruptly with special graphics and sound effects during the match's opening.\n\n10x Battles and 100x Battles were introduced in Splatoon 2 with the 4.0.0 update. They occur randomly during Splatfest Battle (Normal) and Splatfest Battle (Pro) matches, earning players the clout gained after battle multiplied by ten or one hundred. 100x Battles occur less frequently; winning a 100x Battle adds a picture of the player's winning team, which can be seen on the Pledge Box.\n\n100x Battles occurred every ten minutes at their introduction, but around June 2019 were changed to occur every five minutes,[4] while 10x Battles occur more frequently. The 100x Battle rate was later increased again in celebration of Final Fest, where approximately ten 100x Battles could occur in a minute. This increased rate was still in place for the special encore Splatfests that were held afterwards, as well as the Super Mushroom vs. Super Star Splatfest.[5][6] The Synergy Bonus is rounded to the nearest integer before the 10x or 100x bonus is applied. Losing a 10x or 100x Battle adds no bonus to Clout.\n\nThe winners of both 10x and 100x battles would be featured in a newsflash that is displayed as text in the lobby, as text on the SplatNet 2 app and as an image on the Splatfest booth in the Square. Newsflashes of players who win a 100x Battle are displayed for all players within a Splatfest, while newsflashes of players who win a 10x Battle are displayed for themselves and their friends who are playing during the same Splatfest. If a player won a 100x Battle, the newsflash of their victory would display on their session for around half an hour before displaying the winners of other battles. The news images of the winners from these battles showed the players striking different poses, where the winners from a 100x Battle would be holding a large check.\n\nIn Splatoon 3, 10x and 100x Battles return alongside the newly added 333x Battles and Conch Clashes. These special battles are exclusive to Splatfest Battle, available in both Open and Pro modes; they do not occur in Tricolor Battle mode. The player's most recent special battle win will be listed in the Pledge Box as plain text.\n\n10x Battles occur more commonly compared to Splatoon 2, and will reward the winning players with festival shells along with the multiplied clout. As of the 8.0.0 update, winning a 10x Battle also rewards the winning players with one conch shell.\n\nThe chance for a 100x Battle to occur depends on the number of festival shells of each participating player. These increase the odds of a 100x Battle occurring. When winning a 100x Battle, the winning team will perform a unique victory emote. Regardless of winning or losing, each participating player's festival shells will be reset after the battle. As of the 8.0.0 update, winning a 100x Battle also rewards the winning players with ten conch shells.\n\n333x Battles, introduced in Splatoon 3, are the rarest form of special battles wherein the winning players' Clout is multiplied by 333. They occur if the two opposing teams manage to activate a 100x Battle at the same time, with the odds increasing depending on how many festival shells each player has. Since the 8.0.0 update, winning a 333x Battle also rewards the winning players with 33 conch shells.\n\nAfter a player has won a 100x or 333x Battle, a Splatfest Star will be displayed above their head in battles until the Splatfest has ended.[7] The fish-like creature in Splatfest Stars is similar in appearance to the combined Splatfest Floats; the design slightly differs depending on which type of special battle was won.\n\nConch Clashes were introduced in version 8.0.0. They may occur during mirror matches, wherein the two opposing teams are on the same Splatfest team. Winning a Conch Clash rewards players with 1, 10 or 33 conch shells, similar to 10x, 100x and 333x Battles.\n\nFrom version 2.0.0 until version 9.0.0, players could unlock the option to board Splatfest floats by winning a 100x or 333x Battle. After the 9.0.0 update, the option to board a float is also unlocked as soon as the player reaches Ruler status.\n\nAs an expansion of Anarchy Splatcast during Splatfests, Deep Cut broadcasts straight from the front lines of Splatfests to announce special battle winners.[8] As of version 3.0.0, when the player is in the lobby, announcements of a 10x, 100x, and 333x Battle victory and its victors are displayed on the player's Sea-Cucumber Phone. The names of the most current winners of 100x and 333x Battles will always be announced, while winners of 10x Battles are only shown if one of the winners is on a player's friend list.\n\nDuring the Grand Festival, Deep Cut only announced those victories for Team Future. The Squid Sisters announced victories for Team Past, and Off the Hook announced for Team Present.\n\nPlayers receive Splatfest Points at the end of each Splatfest Battle and Tricolor Battle. Accumulated Splatfest Points are tracked in the Splatfest Rank meter; with each Rank upgrade, players receive a new title, i.e. Cats Champion.\n\nSuper Sea Snails are awarded to participants based on their final total Splatfest Rank. Members of the winning team receive slightly more Super Sea Snails than the losing team(s).\n\nSplatoon 2's version 4.0.0 introduced special team names for individual teams in Splatfest Battle (Normal) of four (not to be confused with the overall Splatfest team) which were assigned if the whole team has matching gear, weapons or appearance.\n\nSplatfest team names are separated into five main categories, each of which has one slot in the final team name, meaning there can only be up to five name parts in a team name. Under these categories are several sub-series that determine what the displayed name unit should be if there are more matching properties within a category.\n\nIndividual team names have returned for Splatfest Battle (Open) in Splatoon 3. Almost every piece of gear, weapon, or appearance warrants a unique title, which can be mixed with other titles to generate a one-of-a-kind team name.\n\nMany changes have been made to the possible Splatfest team names from the transition from Splatoon 2 to Splatoon 3. This includes changes to returning gear titles, the addition of new gear and gear brands, the addition of new main weapons and weapon classes, the addition of new sub and special weapons, and the addition of new player customization options.\n\nBefore version 4.0.0, Splatfest Battle was split into the Splatfest Battle (solo) and Splatfest Battle (team) modes.\n\nSplatfest Battle (solo) worked like Splatoon's Splatfest Battle mode: the player would be automatically matched with three other players and then battle against a group of four random players from the opposing team.\n\nSplatfest Battle (team) required four players on one another's friend lists to join a private lobby before being matched up against another team of four. Unlike the original game, players from the same team were not automatically matched up in the same lobby after a match.\n\nBefore version 2.0.0 made Tricolor Battle its separate mode, only members of the second and third-place teams were able to select it, where they were guaranteed to be on the attacking teams. The leading team would randomly play a Tricolor Battle when playing Splatfest Battle (Open) mode, where they would always be on the defending team. The results of the Tricolor Turf Wars were added to the clout for Splatfest Battle (Open). Splatfest Battle (Pro) was unaffected by this, and Tricolor Turf Wars would not have occurred there.\n\nSplatoon 3 features six badges exclusive to 10x Battles. 100x and 333x Battles get treated as 10x Battles and count towards the total participations and wins needed to obtain them.\n\nAlternate music tracks performed by idols play during Splatfest Battles. Special Splatfest events typically have themed track variations.\n\nIn place of standard multiplayer battle songs, the only music track that would play during Splatfest Battles was Ink Me Up, with Now or Never replaced with a Squid Sisters cover.\n\nIn place of standard multiplayer battle songs, the only music tracks that would play during Splatfest Battles were Acid Hues, Muck Warfare and Ebb & Flow. Now or Never, Turf Master and Ink Another Day would be replaced by Off the Hook covers, each track title Now or Never! (Off the Hook), Fest Zest and Party's Over respectively.\n\nThe only music tracks that play during Splatfest Battles are Fins in the Air, Till Depth Do Us Part, Liquid Sunshine (as of Nessie vs. Aliens vs. Bigfoot), Big Betrayal (as of Shiver vs. Frye vs. Big Man) and Suffer No Fools (as of Lightly Salted vs. Consommé vs. Salted Seaweed / Drums vs. Guitar vs. Keyboard). Deep Cut covers of Now or Never, the victory and loss themes would play in their place, titled Ego Overboard and Still Swimmin'.\n\nUnique versions of the victory and loss themes performed by each idol individually were first heard in the Shiver vs. Frye vs. Big Man event; starting with Friday vs. Saturday vs. Sunday and Red Bean Paste vs. Custard vs. Whipped Cream, the victory theme cover corresponding to the player's team's representative idol plays every time the player wins a 10x, 100x or 333x Battle.\n\n- Example of a 100x winners' commemorative photo before the Halftime Report in Splatoon 3.\n\n- Example of a 100x winners' commemorative photo after the Halftime Report. Note the Octolings' incorrect facial features.\n\n- A similar image before the Halftime Report, with the Octoling's features fixed.\n\n- 100x Splatfest Star\n\n- 333x Splatfest Star"
