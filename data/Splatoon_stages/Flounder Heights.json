This is where most fighting occurs, as the only way to get to the other side of the map is by going over the towers or through the alley beneath the bridge. Two alleys separate each team's base from the central towers, which each consist of one tree for cover. The bases in Flounder Heights resemble the starting areas in Saltspray Rig; the other team cannot reach the higher part of the plaza, and there are four ways of exiting into the low alleys. On both sides of the stage is a map that shows the layout of ink on the stage from a top-down perspective. However, the  GamePad map renders these mostly redundant.\n\nFlounder Heights received significant changes in Splatoon 3. The spawn region was changed drastically, moved more to the left and having more flat ground that leads to the left or to slightly higher ground to the right. The tunnel to the right side of the stage has been removed. Between the spawn points and middle of the stage remains mostly the same, except that there is now a pit in the center of the low ground. The left wall up to the middle of the stage also has changed slightly, with the other side being uninkable. Parts of the wall on the right have been made uninkable and terrain on the right has been removed. The entire center of the stage has been made shorter in height. The general structure of the center of the stage is the same.\n\nIn Ranked Battles, specifications for the terrain or placement of objects are different between the modes; these changes create new paths or new objects to take cover behind.\n\nThe layout of Flounder Heights is unchanged, with the two Splat Zones located on the towers in the center of the map. Inkable walls can be used for direct access to either zone, in addition to the path on the left side. The grated bridge connecting the towers can be used to move directly between the zones.\n\nIn Splatoon 3 the Splat Zones are in the same place. The small pit near the middle of the stage is filled to be on the same level as the main floor. An Inkrail is added on each team's snipe, giving another way to the towers.\n\nThe Tower starts in the trench between the two towers in the center of the map, below the grate connecting them. It then moves directly out of the trench and over the small wall into the alley. The tower then turns right before heading to the ramp into the sandlot outside the opposing team's spawn point, where the goal is located.\n\nIn Splatoon 3 the Tower route is significantly changed. The Tower starts on the grates instead of being below them. It goes right then forward to go down the main entrance to the towers. After reaching the bottom, it goes forward for a bit then left to the goal. It is also possible to Squid Surge to the Tower from the trench.\n\nThe Rainmaker in Flounder Heights is located on top of the grated bridge in the center of the map. The goal is located outside of the opposing team's base in the sandlot below the spawn point. Three stacks of boxes have been added to help the attacking team get inside the enemy team's starting plaza.\n\nIn Splatoon 3, the Rainmaker starts on the same area as before. The checkpoints are located on the main entrance to the towers and on the open area next to the ramp up. The goal is located in the open area of each team's spawn, closer to the drop. A ramp is added for access.\n\nThe baskets are located on the bottom, right before the ramp up. The pit is not filled, hampering a way to the basket.\n\nFlounder Heights was revealed during a Japanese promotional trailer depicting new updates on 24 July 2015. It was released on 20 August 2015.\n\n- In addition to changing the stage layout in Rainmaker, other adjustments have been made to prevent users from taking certain shortcuts in all modes and to prevent the attachment of Suction Bombs in certain places.\n\n- Added prohibited areas in Walleye Warehouse, Saltspray Rig, Arowana Mall, and Flounder Heights in Rainmaker mode.\n\n- Adjustments made to prevent players from taking certain shortcuts in all modes.\n\n- Adjustment made to prevent players from taking unintended shortcuts in Tower Control mode.\n\n- Turf War\n\n- Splat Zones\n\n- Tower Control\n\n- Rainmaker\n\n- A fight across rooftops of   vs  .\n\n- A fight taking place down below on the streets.\n\n- A high view of pre-release Flounder Heights.\n\n- Rainmaker being played on Flounder Heights.\n\n- A team of Inklings spawning at Flounder Heights.\n\n- Animated GIF of an Inkling firing a Heavy Splatling in Flounder Heights.\n\n- Top-right view of Flounder Heights.\n\n- Bottom-right view of Flounder Heights.\n\n- Bottom-left view of Flounder Heights.\n\n- Top-left view of Flounder Heights.\n\n- The park seen at Flounder Heights.\n\n- Two sparrows on the ground at Flounder Heights.\n\n- Two more sparrows on a wall.\n\n- One of the flowering vines near Flounder Heights' spawn points.\n\n- A bulletin board at Flounder Heights.\n\n- A jellyfish dancing on a balcony next to one of Flounder Heights' spawn points.\n\n- A jellyfish silhouetted in a window during a Splatfest.\n\n- Lights on in the windows.\n\n- The night sky over Flounder Heights during a Splatfest.\n\nFlounder Heights was available in the following Splatfests in Splatoon:\n\n- Singing vs. Dancing\n\n- Autobots vs. Decepticons\n\n- Airhead vs. Wisecracker\n\n- Naughty vs. Nice\n\n- Get Fit vs. Get Rich\n\n- Red Kitsune Udon vs. Green Tanuki Soba (December 2015)\n\n- Fancy Party vs. Costume Party\n\nFlounder Heights was announced to return in the 10 August 2022 Nintendo Direct and arrived in the game at the start of Chill Season 2022. The complex has been redeveloped in collaboration with the local government and industry academics, \"going greener\" in the process.[1] The stage's overall elevation was lowered, allowing for easier movement across the stage. The spawn region was also overhauled, being made much larger and more open. The walls near the Splat Zones are also no longer climbable, and the grated walkway was mostly removed.\n\nFlounder Heights was available in the following Splatfests as a Tricolor Turf War stage in Splatoon 3:\n\n- Lightly Salted vs. Consommé vs. Salted Seaweed\n\n- Drums vs. Guitar vs. Keyboard\n\n- Past vs. Present vs. Future\n\n- — Fixed an issue that caused ink fired from up high to disappear before hitting the ground.\n\n- — Fixed an issue when playing Splat Zones/Tower Control/Rainmaker/Clam Blitz modes that allowed you to jump from an inkrail onto a water tank.\n\n- — Fixed an issue in Tower Control mode where players sometimes clipped into terrain and became stuck.\n\n- —Slightly changed terrain in all modes.\n\n- Turf War\n\n- Splat Zones\n\n- Tower Control\n\n- Rainmaker\n\n- Clam Blitz\n\n- Tricolor Turf War\n\n- Turf War\n\n- Splat Zones\n\n- Tower Control\n\n- Rainmaker\n\n- Clam Blitz\n\n- A tank from Flounder Heights in the Return of the Mammalians trailer\n\n- A view of the stage from the inside\n\n- Some jellyfish playing outside the stage\n\n- An overview of the stage\n\n- Some Inklings entering the stage\n\n- A map of the complex's layout, with the stage itself shown in the center\n\n- Laundromat\n\n- Barber shop\n\n- Overhead view of the stage's Tricolor Turf War layout during Drums vs. Guitar vs. Keyboard\n\n- Overhead view of the stage's Tricolor Turf War layout during Lightly Salted vs. Consommé vs. Salted Seaweed\n\n- Wallpaper obtained through Wandercrust\n\n- Square version\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Flounder_Heights_promotional_video.mp4\n\n\nPromotional Video (link to file)\n\n- This stage was featured in some promotional imagery for the release of the Rainmaker mode before it was released.\n\n- This stage's name was accidentally shown in a GameXplain  preview video long before it was properly revealed.\n\n- Cicadas can be heard singing from the trees throughout the stage. The audio used is similar, if not identical, to that of the Brown Cicada, Walker Cicada, and Robust Cicada in the Animal Crossing series.\nThe cicadas will also sound agitated if their tree is inked.\nDuring Splatfests, which took place at night, crickets could be heard instead.\n\n- The cicadas will also sound agitated if their tree is inked.\n\n- During Splatfests, which took place at night, crickets could be heard instead.\n\n- According to Callie, the battles on Flounder Heights occur in the afternoon at sunset.\n\n- Near the end of a match, the horn of a tofu seller can be heard.\n\n- The cicadas will also sound agitated if their tree is inked.\n\n- During Splatfests, which took place at night, crickets could be heard instead.\n\n- A ghost can be seen in a window of one of the apartment buildings.[2] However, it appears to have been only made visible at night in an update.[3]\n\n- For a split second in the  \"Return of the Mammalians\" trailer for Splatoon 3, an image depicting a water tank found in Flounder Heights can be seen in a black-and-white filter, around 1:10-1:11. It appears to be taken from the stage thumbnail for Splatoon.[4]\n\n- On a pinboard found in the middle of the stage, a poster of a plate of curry can be seen. This poster could reference Chapter 2 of the Splatoon manga, where Team Blue win against Army's team on Flounder Heights, thanks to curry.\n\nFlounder Heights is a reference to the real-life flounder.\n\n- Flounder Heights on StrategyWiki"
