    "Hammerhead Bridge is a multiplayer stage in Splatoon and Splatoon 3. In Splatoon, the bridge is undergoing construction, creating a narrow stage featuring grated bridges across the stage's length. In Splatoon 3, the bridge has finished construction, introducing supportive pillars, an effective \"roof\", removing the grated platforms, and flattening the stage. The general layout of the grated bridge remains, just as solid ground instead. It is one of the stages that can have Tricolor Turf Wars.",
    "In Splatoon, Hammerhead Bridge is under construction, giving way to many chasms around the stage's various platforms. It is split into a bottom layer and a top layer. The top layer is made up of a grated bridge that runs through the map and many platforms. The bottom layer is below the bridge, providing cover from players across the stage, and boasting many ways to reach the top layer. The bridge runs through the stage connecting various platforms, making up the top layer of the map and overlooking many parts of it. The lower platform is right below the grated bridge and makes up most of the stage.",
    "In Splatoon 3, Hammerhead Bridge is no longer under construction. It is a narrow stage with fewer chasms and vulnerable spots.",
    "In Ranked Battles, specifications for the terrain or placement of objects are different between the modes; these changes create new paths or new objects to take cover behind.",
    "The Splat Zone on Hammerhead Bridge is located at the center of the stage on the lowest floor beneath the grated bridge. The zone is very long and narrow, spanning almost the entire width of the stage. Because the grated bridge crosses over the zone, players on it are huge targets from players below as there is not much cover from below. Two small walls have been taken out near the center and three barriers have been added.",
    "The Tower in this stage is located on top of the grated bridge and its goal is located two platforms down from each team's starting areas, below the bridge. While someone is riding the Tower, it first travels to the right of the riding team a bit and starts going forward on the side of the bridge. Once it reaches the bridge's edge, the Tower then goes down to the ground and continues traveling right again, ascending to the top of the small, grated platform there. Upon reaching the top, it then goes forward a bit and takes a left, heading back towards the grated bridge. It then starts to go down the side of the wall and continues traveling forward towards the goal.",
    "In Splatoon 3, the tower is located in the center of the map. When advancing, the tower proceeds towards the left side of the map in a zig-zag pattern before climbing the ramp on the left side, exiting the middle. After reaching the top of the ramp and clearing the second checkpoint, the tower then proceeds to the right. After the third checkpoint is cleared, the tower then moves forward, climbing two ledges before reaching the goal.",
    "The Rainmaker starts in the very center of the stage, on top of the grated bridge. The goals are located in each team's base, in front of their spawn point. Many stacks of inkable crates have been added to provide more ways to attack the opposing team and get inside their base.",
    "The Tricolor Turf War variant of Hammerhead Bridge does not change much of the general layout of the stage. The changes made are the removal of the pillars in the spawn area and the right path of the spawn area. A ramp is added on the left side and the lower area is connected to the smaller platforms in the middle. On the far left and right of the middle, a platform is added to serve as the spawn area for the defending team.",
    "Hammerhead Bridge was revealed during a Japanese promotional trailer depicting new updates on 24 July 2015. It was released on 18 September 2015 at 02:00 UTC.[1][2]",

The stage was available at launch. This is also one of the stages that can have Tricolor Turf Wars. The bridge is the main connection from the Inkadia region to the Splatlands.",

    "- Jellyfish can be seen on top of the bridge to the right and left sides of the stage.",
    "- The remains of the NILS Statue after the events of Octo Expansion can be seen underneath Hammerhead Bridge, matching its appearance in the background of MC.Princess Diaries.\nThe Art of Splatoon 3 reveals that the NILS Statue's emergence was indirectly responsible for the completion of Hammerhead Bridge—its surfacing damaged structures in the water and hindered the navigation of vessels, leading to the bridge's construction being accelerated and completed two years before the events of Splatoon 3.[4]",
    "- The poster used to announce the stage rework of Hammerhead Bridge appears to reference the thumbnail of a commercial by the West Nippon Expressway Company announcing the temporary closure of an expressway due to construction.[5]",
    "The stage's name is a reference to the real-life hammerhead shark and Hammersmith Bridge in London, England.",
