    "Ancho-V Games is a video game company in the Splatoon series. The office complex it is housed in serves as a multiplayer stage in Splatoon and Splatoon 2 (also named Ancho-V Games). The defining features of the stage are propeller lifts that are central to the navigation of the stage. In Splatoon 3, Ancho-V Games instead appears as a band, with all Tableturf Battle music released under their name.",
    "Ancho-V Games has raised floors and interactive platforms, and is unique in its incorporation of propellers from Octo Valley that activate lifts. When these are hit by ink, the platform underneath moves. If the propellers are subsequently left uninked, the platform slowly falls back to its original position.",
    "There are three different platforms with propellers that can be found on both sides of the stage, making a total of six. One can be found to the right of the spawn point that moves horizontally, another in the central part of the stage that moves vertically, and one to the left of the spawn point that moves both horizontally and vertically. There are small areas off to the side of each team's base that each contain a single propeller; following one of the areas eventually brings the player to the center of the stage. When lowered, the center is flat, except for a couple of boxes placed for cover.",
    "In Splatoon 2, the area to the left of the spawn point where the small, square propeller lift was located was removed and was replaced with a new section featuring a long, rectangular propeller lift which has walls on the sides for cover that allows players to drop into the middle area. The middle section has also been updated. The two propeller lifts have been cut in half and are now a lot smaller with small raised platforms added at the removed portions. Two pillars have been added at each team's right, which can be used as another method of getting to higher elevation aside from the propeller lift. The area immediately in front of the base has also been modified, with much more space accessible by the opposing team. Sponges have also been added to the stage.",
    "In Ranked Battles, specifications for the terrain or placement of objects are different between the modes; these changes create new paths or new objects to take cover behind.",
    "The Splat Zone is located in the very center of the stage, included with the boxes in the middle. Some boxes have been added to the side lanes to give both teams some attacking space and to keep the other team from entering the center a certain way.",
    "The Tower is located at the center, replacing the boxes normally there. The goals are located near the front of each spawn point, which has also been moved to the left, replacing the floating platforms once there. The propeller in front of both teams' regular spawn area has been taken out and the platform has been extended permanently. Several boxes and platforms have been added to help with defense and offense for both teams.",
    "The Rainmaker is located at the center, above the boxes in the middle. Boxes have been added to the middle area, giving players an extra route into enemy territory. A ramp has been added to reach the spawn area of each team and a pile of boxes near it. The goal is located near the spawn point next to a propeller lift. If the propeller on the platform is not inked, it can be difficult for a Rainmaker carrier to make the jump to the platform.",
    "In Splatoon 2, the goal was moved to the new area that immediately drops off from the spawn point. A new inkable wall has been added in the central area to make accessible the opposing team's side easier. Three primary routes can be taken. The new inkable wall and propeller lift allow access to the left path. Using the Rainmaker shot itself, players can call in the propeller lift located on the right side of the stage which allows access to the right path.",
    "The baskets are located deep into each team's side of the stage, located just in front of the drop from the plaza. To reach the basket, players must either ride up the propeller lift into the enemy area or swim up a small inkable block added to access the right path into the enemy base. The inkable pillar seen in other modes used as an alternative to the propeller lift has been removed.",
    "Ancho-V Games was announced on 16 December 2015 along with Piranha Pit[1] and released on 22 January 2016 at 02:00 UTC.[2] It was the final stage released for Splatoon.[3]",
    "Ancho-V Games was available in the following Splatfests in Splatoon:",
    "Ancho-V Games was announced on 12 July 2018 at 05:13 UTC, along with the Nautilus 47 and Bloblobber.[4] It was added to the game on 1 August 2018 at 00:00 UTC.[5]",
    "In Splatoon 3, all the music that plays in Tableturf Battles is credited to Ancho-V Games. Their music has a chiptune style with almost no vocals, imitative of traditional video game music; this theme is furthered by the structure of their songs' names as descriptions of when they play.",
    "Ancho-V is derived from \"anchovy\", a type of fish.",
