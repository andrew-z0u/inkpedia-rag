  "content": "Port Mackerel is a multiplayer stage in Splatoon and Splatoon 2.\n\nPort Mackerel is a shipping yard and, as such, numerous containers litter the field, making for several narrow paths in a grid shape. In the middle is another gridded area, and on either side of it is an open area and inkable forklifts that ride back and forth across all three lanes. There also exist two upper paths from either spawn point that run around the perimeter of the map, ending in the middle area. It includes many corridors, such as ones around large, colored boxes and crates.\n\n- 1 Layout\n\n- 2 Ranked Battle terrain\n\n2.1 Splat Zones\n2.2 Tower Control\n2.3 Rainmaker\n2.4 Clam Blitz\n\n- 2.1 Splat Zones\n\n- 2.2 Tower Control\n\n- 2.3 Rainmaker\n\n- 2.4 Clam Blitz\n\n- 3 Splatoon\n\n3.1 Version history\n3.2 Maps\n3.3 Gallery\n3.4 Splatfests\n\n- 3.1 Version history\n\n- 3.2 Maps\n\n- 3.3 Gallery\n\n- 3.4 Splatfests\n\n- 4 Splatoon 2\n\n4.1 Version history\n4.2 Maps\n4.3 Gallery\n\n- 4.1 Version history\n\n- 4.2 Maps\n\n- 4.3 Gallery\n\n- 5 Quotes\n\n- 6 Trivia\n\n- 7 Etymology\n\n7.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 7.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 8 External links\n\n- 2.1 Splat Zones\n\n- 2.2 Tower Control\n\n- 2.3 Rainmaker\n\n- 2.4 Clam Blitz\n\n- 3.1 Version history\n\n- 3.2 Maps\n\n- 3.3 Gallery\n\n- 3.4 Splatfests\n\n- 4.1 Version history\n\n- 4.2 Maps\n\n- 4.3 Gallery\n\n- 7.1 Names in other languages\n\nPort Mackerel has open battlefields which are where most of the combat takes place. Both open battlefields are separated from each other by a set of cargo containers. These battlefields, while being very open for vision, can be difficult to maneuver around for some players, as the narrow paths and stacks of crates do not allow for much vision of the area. It is possible, in Turf War and Tower Control, to climb on top of the covered storage crates by either using the forklifts or by climbing on the Tower. These can serve as useful vantage points as they are on higher ground, and since they are covered in an ink-resistant tarp, there is no enemy ink to get stuck in. The walls of the crates are also inkable, giving players a place to recharge ink or hide, without having to give up their vantage point. There are four side passages in this stage, two on the player's side and two on the enemy side. They are all accessed on the left or right sides of the map and lead to small openings on the side of the open battlefields, which cannot be climbed up due to small ledges. The side passages are often forgotten parts of the map, particularly because they are mostly out of the action and are only accessible from the area near the spawn points.\n\nPort Mackerel received a fair number of changes to its layout in Splatoon 2. The general structure of the stage is unchanged, but all the obstacles have been changed or spread out to make the corridors less tight. The forklifts now only travel halfway across the stage to the respective team's left. Four sponges have been added, one on each team's plaza and two at the very center of the stage.\n\nIn Ranked Battles, specifications for the terrain or placement of objects are different between the modes; these changes create new paths or new objects to take cover behind.\n\nIn Splatoon, there are two zones located on one side of the two open areas of the map. The only known change from the Turf War iteration is the fact that the forklifts which move back and forth between the shipping containers are absent.\n\nIn Splatoon 2, there is only a single Splat Zone at the center of the map. The only notable changes are the removal of the forklifts and the introduction of a small inkable barrier to the left corridor on each team's plaza.\n\nThe Tower starts in the center of the map and moves along the rail, passing through the open battlefields and weaving in between boxes until it reaches the top of the box directly in front of the opponent's spawn. Two inkable boxes have been added to the right side of the open battlefields, allowing players to access the side passages from this area.\n\nIn Splatoon 2, additional sponges have been added immediately in front of each team's spawn point to give them easier access to the upper area. The goal has been moved off the box and onto the ground beside it.\n\nThe Rainmaker is located in the middle of the stage. The Rainmaker must be taken to a pillar located on top of the cargo container in front of the rival spawn point. A couple of platforms are supplied to make reaching higher ground easier, while the pillar can only be accessed by either climbing the newly-placed board on the backside of the container or jumping from the high ground.\n\nIn Splatoon 2, the location of the Rainmaker and goal remain the same. A ramp has been added to make getting to the Rainmaker pedestal easier. Four additional sponges have been added, two immediately in front of each team's spawn as well as another sponge in each team's plaza of the opposing team's color.\n\nThe clam baskets are located immediately outside each team's starting corridor to the right side of the team's plaza. The map layout is the same as in Splat Zones, with Inkrails added to the left of each team's starting corridor, the removal of the sponge in each team's spawn, and a block allowing you to get on top of more crates.\n\nPort Mackerel was the first stage to be added to Splatoon after launch, being released on 2 June 2015 at 02:00 UTC.\n\n- Adjustments have been made to prevent users from taking certain shortcuts in all modes.\n\n- Turf War\n\n- Splat Zones\n\n- Tower Control\n\n- Rainmaker\n\n- Promotional screenshot\n\n- Alternate viewpoint\n\n- Inklings riding a forklift at Port Mackerel.\n\n- A pair of differently-sized jellyfish talking behind the glass at Port Mackerel.\n\n- An Inkling firing the Aerospray PG.\n\n- An Inkling with the Slosher Deco at Port Mackerel.\n\nPort Mackerel was available in the following Splatfests in Splatoon:\n\n- Red Kitsune Udon vs. Green Tanuki Soba (July 2015)\n\n- Rock vs. Pop\n\n- Roller Coasters vs. Water Slides\n\n- Autobots vs. Decepticons\n\n- Squid vs. Octopus\n\n- Cars vs. Planes\n\n- Zombies vs. Ghosts\n\n- Tuna & Mayonnaise vs. Red Salmon\n\n- World Tour vs. Space Adventure\n\nPort Mackerel was released with the launch of Splatoon 2. The turf on this stage has been widened, and many of the crates around the stage have either been shrunken down, had the tarps removed allowing them to be inked, or have been replaced with sponges. The forklifts from the first game return, but now only move across half of the stage's width. A modified version of this stage is used in A02 Far-Out Station in the Octo Expansion.\n\n- Fixed an issue occurring in Port Mackerel where inking the top of an uninkable container near the center of the map earned a small amount of points and filled the special gauge slightly.\n\n- Changed the movement range of the forklifts in Port Mackerel to fix an issue where players caught between the forklift and a sponge were occasionally pushed inside the forklift.\n\n- Adjusted the path of the tower in Tower Control mode in Port Mackerel to fix an issue where players caught between the tower's pillar and a stage object when the tower entered a narrow space appeared to be shaking.\n\n- Adjusted the size of the sponge near the spawn points in Port Mackerel to fix an issue where a slight discrepancy existed between the height of the sponge when fully expanded and the height of the platform on the tower.\n\n- Adjusted placement of objects in Rainmaker.\nAdjusted shape of the sponges near the starting point.\nSet the area above certain containers near the center as Rainmaker-Free Zones.\n\n- Adjusted shape of the sponges near the starting point.\n\n- Set the area above certain containers near the center as Rainmaker-Free Zones.\n\n- Adjusted shape of the sponges near the starting point.\n\n- Set the area above certain containers near the center as Rainmaker-Free Zones.\n\n- Fixed an issue getting into landforms when executing Super Jump from specific location to a specific location in Port Mackerel.\n\n- Fixed an issue in Rainmaker on Port Mackerel in which a player could not submerge into some walls near the starting point even though they could be painted.\n\n- On-screen brightness will no longer change dramatically depending on the amount of light hitting the camera during Splatfest Battles.\n\n- Fixed an issue causing a player to fall off the stage and get splatted when pushed into a specific outer wall in the stage as the result of an opponent's attack.\n\n- Turf War\n\n- Splat Zones\n\n- Tower Control\n\n- Rainmaker\n\n- Clam Blitz\n\n- Port Mackerel in Splatoon 2.\n\n- Team Leo at Port Mackerel.\n\n- Port Mackerel during a Splatfest.\n\n- Turf War (Splatfest) icon for Port Mackerel.\n\n- Two Inklings taking a photo at Port Mackerel in a promo image for version 2.0.0 of Splatoon 2.\n\n- Port Mackerel was the first stage to be released after the launch of Splatoon. It is also the first returning stage to release in Splatoon 2, alongside Moray Towers.\n\n- Port Mackerel is one of four multiplayer stages to appear in the Octo Expansion, alongside Snapper Canal, Manta Maria, and Starfish Mainstage.\n\n- Port Mackerel is one of three multiplayer stages to not be truly symmetrical, alongside Saltspray Rig and Kelp Dome. The box shape in the Splat Zones are different shapes.\n\nThe map's name is a reference to the real-life fish Mackerel.\n\nThe French name is also a reference to the real-life fish Haddock.\n\nPort Mackerel's internal map entry in Splatoon 2 is \"Fld_Amida01_Vss\" when most map entries use the number 00, possibly meaning there was an earlier version of Port Mackerel in Splatoon 2 at one point.\n\n- Port Mackerel on StrategyWiki"
