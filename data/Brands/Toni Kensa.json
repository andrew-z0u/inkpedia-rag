Kensa's gear also tends to be very expensive, with most of their gear being 3-star items. A few of the clothes seem to be from other brands, simply recolored as black and white, such as the Toni Kensa Black Hi-Tops being the Trooper Power Stripes series (even having the logo still on the shoes' tongues) from Takoroka but in black and dark red, or the Kensa Coat being a black rebrand of Zekko coats. Most of the clothes also have a button or small red spot that shows Toni Kensa's logo.\n\nUnlike most weapon brands, Kensa's weapons' ink barrels do not change color according to the user's ink color. The weapons also have red clips on them.\n\nFor the category page, see Category:Toni Kensa.\n\n- Collection #1\n Kensa Splattershot\n Kensa Splat Roller\n Kensa Charger\n Kensa Splatterscope\n Kensa Splat Dualies\n\n- Kensa Splattershot\n\n- Kensa Splat Roller\n\n- Kensa Charger\n\n- Kensa Splatterscope\n\n- Kensa Splat Dualies\n\n- Collection #2\n Kensa Splattershot Pro\n Kensa Luna Blaster\n Kensa Dynamo Roller\n Kensa Sloshing Machine\n\n- Kensa Splattershot Pro\n\n- Kensa Luna Blaster\n\n- Kensa Dynamo Roller\n\n- Kensa Sloshing Machine\n\n- Collection #3\n Kensa Splattershot Jr.\n Kensa L-3 Nozzlenose\n Kensa Octobrush\n Kensa Undercover Brella\n\n- Kensa Splattershot Jr.\n\n- Kensa L-3 Nozzlenose\n\n- Kensa Octobrush\n\n- Kensa Undercover Brella\n\n- Collection #4\n Kensa .52 Gal\n Kensa Rapid Blaster\n Kensa Mini Splatling\n Kensa Glooga Dualies\n\n- Kensa .52 Gal\n\n- Kensa Rapid Blaster\n\n- Kensa Mini Splatling\n\n- Kensa Glooga Dualies\n\n- Kensa Splattershot\n\n- Kensa Splat Roller\n\n- Kensa Charger\n\n- Kensa Splatterscope\n\n- Kensa Splat Dualies\n\n- Kensa Splattershot Pro\n\n- Kensa Luna Blaster\n\n- Kensa Dynamo Roller\n\n- Kensa Sloshing Machine\n\n- Kensa Splattershot Jr.\n\n- Kensa L-3 Nozzlenose\n\n- Kensa Octobrush\n\n- Kensa Undercover Brella\n\n- Kensa .52 Gal\n\n- Kensa Rapid Blaster\n\n- Kensa Mini Splatling\n\n- Kensa Glooga Dualies\n\nReaching a cumulative amount of stars on Toni Kensa gear will reward the player with badges.\n\n- Toni Kensa promotional art.\n\n- Information from The Art of Splatoon 2.\n\n- A promotional image from The Art of Splatoon 2.\n\n- Toni Kensa video promotional image.\n\n- A black version of the Toni Kensa logo.\n\n- A mem cake of a Toni Kensa logo from the Octo Expansion.\n\n- An Octoling girl with the Kensa Splattershot.\n\n- An Inkling boy with the Kensa Splat Roller.\n\n- An Inkling girl with the Kensa Charger and Kensa Splatterscope.\n\n- An Octoling boy with the Kensa Splat Dualies.\n\n- Kensa Collection #2.\n\n- Kensa Collection #3.\n\n- Kensa Collection #4.\n\n- A promotional image for Splatoon 3 with Toni Kensa gear\n\n- The Banner representing the Toni Kensa brand.\n\n- The Toni Kensa promotional image used for SplatNet 3's daily drops.\n\n- Promotional image for Splatoon 3\n\n- The Toni Kensa logo is a stylized hiragana character \"た\" (ta), from the brand's Japanese name \"Tataki Kensaki\".\nThe logo also resembles the letters T and K, the initials of \"Toni Kensa\" and \"Tataki Kensaki\".\n\n- The logo also resembles the letters T and K, the initials of \"Toni Kensa\" and \"Tataki Kensaki\".\n\n- Toni Kensa adverts can be seen on the walls of The Reef.\n\n- Before Splatoon 2 version 3.1.0, an advertisement for this brand is one of the rotating ads on the left side jumbotron in Inkopolis Square.
