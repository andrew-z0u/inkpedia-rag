    "Toni Kensa is a gear brand in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3. In Splatoon 2, Toni Kensa gear is 5x more likely to roll Main Power Up (formerly Cold-Blooded) as a secondary ability, and has 0.5× chance of rolling Sub Power Up. In Splatoon 3, Toni Kensa accessories are 5x more likely to roll Ink Saver (Main), and has 0.5× chance of rolling Sub Power Up as secondary abilities.",
    "The brand was created by the eponymous fashion designer and produces simple, sharp clothing in black and white. Kensa's gear also tends to be very expensive, with most of their gear being 3-star items. A few of the clothes seem to be from other brands, simply recolored as black and white, such as the Toni Kensa Black Hi-Tops being the Trooper Power Stripes series (even having the logo still on the shoes' tongues) from Takoroka but in black and dark red, or the Kensa Coat being a black rebrand of Zekko coats. Most of the clothes also have a button or small red spot that shows Toni Kensa's logo.",
    "Unlike most weapon brands, Kensa's weapons' ink barrels do not change color according to the user's ink color. The weapons also have red clips on them.",

    "- Despite being named after a specific designer in-universe, the brand was stated in social media posts leading up to the release of Splatoon 3 to have acquired a new lead designer and creative director since the events of Splatoon 2.[2] This may be a further reference to Takeo Kikuchi, the real-life fashion designer the brand's Japanese name is likely a parody of, who stepped down from designing for his own self-named brand and entrusted it to a new creative director in 2004, before eventually returning to the company in 2012.[4]",
