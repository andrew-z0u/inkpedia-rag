  "content": "Zink is a gear brand within the Splatoon series. Zink gear has 5× chance to roll Quick Super Jump as a secondary ability and a 0.5× chance of getting Quick Respawn.\n\nZink seems to be the main supplier of athletic wear, with the majority of their gear pertaining to some kind of sport. These include basketball shoes, a cycling shirt, and a baseball jersey. They also designed the Zink Mini Splatling. According to the SplatoonJP Twitter account, Zink produces refined, sporty fashion sometimes fitting into an old-school style.[1]\n\n- 1 Gear\n\n- 2 Quotes\n\n2.1 Splatoon\n2.2 Splatoon 2\n2.3 Splatoon 3\n2.4 Splatoon Base\n\n- 2.1 Splatoon\n\n- 2.2 Splatoon 2\n\n- 2.3 Splatoon 3\n\n- 2.4 Splatoon Base\n\n- 3 Weapons\n\n- 4 Label\n\n- 5 Badges\n\n- 6 Gallery\n\n- 7 Trivia\n\n- 8 Etymology\n\n8.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 8.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 9 References\n\n- 2.1 Splatoon\n\n- 2.2 Splatoon 2\n\n- 2.3 Splatoon 3\n\n- 2.4 Splatoon Base\n\n- 8.1 Names in other languages\n\nFor the category page, see Category:Zink.\n\n- Zink Mini Splatling (collaboration with \"Splat\")\n\nZink has gear with the labels 'Dakro', 'Dakronik', 'Deca', 'Seahorse' and 'Hi-Horse'.\n\nReaching a cumulative amount of stars on Zink gear will reward the player with badges.\n\n- Black-and-white version of Zink's logo.\n\n- Zink promotional image for Splatoon.\n\n- An Inkling wearing a full set of Zink gear in Splatoon.\n\n- Promotional image for Zink in Splatoon 2.\n\n- Promotional art of Marie with a Zink bag and black Hi-Horses for Callie vs. Marie.\n\n- Information from The Art of Splatoon 2.\n\n- A promotional image from The Art of Splatoon 2.\n\n- A jellyfish wearing an unnamed Zink shirt in Splatoon 2.\n\n- A mem cake of a Zink logo from the Octo Expansion.\n\n- A promotional image of Zink magazines for Splatoon 3.\n\n- The Zink promotional image seen in SplatNet 3 daily drops.\n\n- Promotional image for Splatoon 3.\n\n- Zink stickers could be seen on the trucks in Inkopolis Plaza before and during a Splatfest.\n\n- Zink's Japanese name, \"Aironikku\", is just the English word \"ironic\". It is unknown what this has to do with the brand itself, though it could possibly relate to the fact that it sounds similar to the element iron.\n\n- The Zink brand is heavily featured on the splash screen in Splatoon, with White Seahorses, a purple shoebox, and a banner, all displaying the Zink logo.\n\n- The Zink brand is possibly based on the Australian clothing brand Quiksilver, as both are named after elements on the periodic table (zinc and mercury respectively, the latter of which is often called quicksilver). Zink clothing also provides \"quick\" stat boosts (as in Quicksilver) and features a vaguely similar logo, furthering the similarities.\n\n- In Splatoon, there is no Zink gear that has Comeback, Defense Up, Haunt, Ink Resistance Up, Last-Ditch Effort, Quick Super Jump, Recon, Stealth Jump, or Tenacity as a primary ability.\n\n- In Splatoon 2, there is no Zink gear that has Comeback, Haunt, Object Shredder, Quick Super Jump or Tenacity as a primary ability.\n\nZink is likely a reference to the mineral, zinc, and ink."
