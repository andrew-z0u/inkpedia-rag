    "- Promotional image of the Emberz collection",
    "- The weapons can be further divided into groups of 2-4 based on the visual (and name) theming of each design which also matches some of the brands' gear designs. The Tweets announcing each weapon were also grouped by this logic, and the descriptions in each group of Tweets are also similar to one another:\nBarazushi\nDark metallic look with night vision scopes: Splash-o-matic GCK-O, Carbon Roller ANG-L, and Dapple Dualies NOC-T\nRusty bronze material and foil-covered ration packs: Painbrush BRN-Z, Tri-Slosher ASH-N, and Splatana Wiper RUS-T\nFrost (light-blue) camouflage, aluminium material and a leaf of kelp: Splattershot Pro FRZ-N, Splat Charger CAM-O, Splatterscope CAM-O, and Rapid Blaster Pro WNT-R.\nSnakeskin patterns and texture with fang-like decoration: Jet Squelcher COB-R, Mini Splatling RTL-R, and H-3 Nozzlenose VIP-R.\nDairy product names and light clean coloration: REEF-LUX 450 MIL-K and Tenta Brella CRE-M.\nEmberz\nColorful holographic / foil material and RGB-striped decorative rings: Glamorz Splattershot, Gleamz Blaster, and Colorz Aerospray.\nAnimal-print patterns, denim material, and metal spikes: Clawz .96 Gal, Hornz Dread Wringer, and Hoofz Dualie Squelchers.\nNeon coloration and stickers: Stickerz Splatana Stamper, Torrentz Hydra Splatling, and Patternz Undercover Brella.\nPastel coloration with glitter in clear plastic material: Twinklez Splat Dualies, Planetz Big Swig Roller, and  Glitterz L-3 Nozzlenose.\nDark coloration with star patterns, LED bulbs and long RGB-colored stripes: Cometz Octobrush, Bulbz Tri-Stringer, and Starz Dynamo Roller.",
    "- The Japanese names for the Emberz weapon all suffix the base weapon name with a single kanji character, usually describing or hinting to the weapon's coloration or print patterns. The announcement Tweets for each of the weapons provided a pronunciation guide, indicating how the kanji should be read.\nAll the weapon names use the on'yomi pronunciation, which is uncommon for standalone kanji words."
