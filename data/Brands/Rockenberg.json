  "content": "Rockenberg is a gear brand in the Splatoon series. Rockenberg items have a 5× chance to roll Run Speed Up, while a 0.5× reduced chance to roll Swim Speed Up. The logo appears to be an 'I' with an eel constricting around it, forming an upside-down and flipped 'R'. It has some text at the bottom written in Inkling.\n\nRockenberg's theme seems to be western-style clothing that one might see in movies, such as motorcycle boots, leather jackets, and aviators. This is also reflected in its name, which is in the style of German words, as well as its logo, which has letters that closely resemble those used in European languages, as opposed to other writing in Splatoon, which may be more ambiguous or resemble Asian languages.\n\n- 1 Gear\n\n- 2 Quotes\n\n2.1 Splatoon 2\n2.2 Splatoon 3\n2.3 Splatoon Base\n\n- 2.1 Splatoon 2\n\n- 2.2 Splatoon 3\n\n- 2.3 Splatoon Base\n\n- 3 Badges\n\n- 4 Gallery\n\n- 5 Trivia\n\n- 6 Names in other languages\n\n- 7 References\n\n- 2.1 Splatoon 2\n\n- 2.2 Splatoon 3\n\n- 2.3 Splatoon Base\n\nFor the category page, see Category:Rockenberg.\n\nReaching a cumulative amount of stars on Rockenberg gear will reward the player with badges.\n\n- A female Inkling wearing a full set of Rockenberg gear in Splatoon.\n\n- Back view.\n\n- Information from The Art of Splatoon 2.\n\n- Promotional image for the brand.\n\n- A promotional image from The Art of Splatoon 2.\n\n- A promotional image for Splatoon 3 depicting magazines of Rockenberg gear.\n\n- Clean version with logo seen on SplatNet 3 Rockenberg daily drops.\n\n- The Banner representing the Rockenberg brand.\n\n- Promotional image for Splatoon 3.\n\n- Rockenberg shares its name with a real-life municipality in Germany.\n\n- In Splatoon, there is no Rockenberg gear that has Cold Blooded, Comeback, Ninja Squid, Opening Gambit, Recon, Run Speed Up or Tenacity as a primary ability.\n\n- In Splatoon 2, there is no Rockenberg gear that has Comeback, Ninja Squid, Opening Gambit, Run Speed Up or Tenacity as a primary ability.\n\n- All of Rockenberg's headgear has 3 sub ability slots except for the Clue-Detecting Cap, having 2."
