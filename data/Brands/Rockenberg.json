    "Rockenberg is a gear brand in the Splatoon series. Rockenberg items have a 5× chance to roll Run Speed Up, while a 0.5× reduced chance to roll Swim Speed Up. The logo appears to be an 'I' with an eel constricting around it, forming an upside-down and flipped 'R'. It has some text at the bottom written in Inkling.",
    "Rockenberg's theme seems to be western-style clothing that one might see in movies, such as motorcycle boots, leather jackets, and aviators. This is also reflected in its name, which is in the style of German words, as well as its logo, which has letters that closely resemble those used in European languages, as opposed to other writing in Splatoon, which may be more ambiguous or resemble Asian languages.",
