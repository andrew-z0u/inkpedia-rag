    "Krak-On is a gear brand within the Splatoon series. Krak-On gear has a 5× chance of getting Swim Speed Up as a secondary gear ability and a 0.5× chance of getting Defense Up as a secondary gear ability in Splatoon and Bomb Defense Up DX (formerly Bomb Defense Up) as a secondary gear ability in Splatoon 2. In Splatoon 3,  Krak-On gear has a 5× chance of getting Swim Speed Up and a 0.5× chance of getting Sub Resistance Up as a secondary gear ability.",
    "Krak-On's focus seems to be retro footwear that is usually alternative or quirky in its style, with such shoes as clogs, canvas high-tops, and canvas slip-ons. This retro theme is even continued with a waistcoat and a work cap.",
    "According to SplatoonJP, Krak-On mainly produces natural-style shoes.[1] As of Splatoon 3, Krak-On has expanded its lineup of retro tops, such as shirts and hoodies.[2][3]",
    "The Krak-On logo in Splatoon consists of a blue stylized squid or kraken silhouette with a bulbous body, four tentacles, and two arms reaching upwards, in an orange-yellow circle with a blue outline.",
    "For Splatoon 2, Krak-On changed their logo to have a red-orange squid/kraken, transparent circle, and to have dark blue and italicized Inkling text of some form diagonally across the logo, overlapping either side of the circle, and with a transparent outline. This logo was retained for Splatoon 3.",
    "For the category page, see Category:Krak-On.",
    "Reaching a cumulative amount of stars on Krak-On gear will reward the player with badges.",
    "The name Krak-On is likely a pun on the legendary sea monster kraken and \"crack on\" as words of encouragement. This is further supported by the fact the Krak-On Splat Roller has the Kraken as its special weapon in Splatoon and the Kraken Royale as its special weapon in Splatoon 3.",
