This retro theme is even continued with a waistcoat and a work cap.\n\nAccording to SplatoonJP, Krak-On mainly produces natural-style shoes.[1] As of Splatoon 3, Krak-On has expanded its lineup of retro tops, such as shirts and hoodies.[2][3]\n\nThe Krak-On logo in Splatoon consists of a blue stylized squid or kraken silhouette with a bulbous body, four tentacles, and two arms reaching upwards, in an orange-yellow circle with a blue outline.\n\nFor Splatoon 2, Krak-On changed their logo to have a red-orange squid/kraken, transparent circle, and to have dark blue and italicized Inkling text of some form diagonally across the logo, overlapping either side of the circle, and with a transparent outline. This logo was retained for Splatoon 3.\n\nFor the category page, see Category:Krak-On.\n\n- Krak-On Splat Roller (collaboration with \"Splat\")\n\nReaching a cumulative amount of stars on Krak-On gear will reward the player with badges.\n\n- Krak-On promotional image for Splatoon.\n\n- Information from The Art of Splatoon 2.\n\n- A promotional image from The Art of Splatoon 2.\n\n- Krak-On promotional image for Splatoon 2.\n\n- A collage of Inklings wearing various pieces of Krak-On gear.\n\n- Promotional image for Splatoon 3 featuring Krak-On magazines\n\n- Promotional image for Splatoon 3.\n\n- Clean version with logo seen on SplatNet 3 Krak-On daily drops.\n\n- Krak-On logo without lettering (as seen in Splatoon).\n\n- Krak-On produces the most shoes of any gear brand in Splatoon, selling 13 different items.\n\n- Krak-On is one of the brands that the player is first introduced to in Splatoon and Splatoon 2 due to the Cream Basics being part of the starting gear.\n\n- Krak-On's logo and some of its products bear a resemblance to those the real-life footwear brand Converse.\n\nThe name Krak-On is likely a pun on the legendary sea monster kraken and \"crack on\" as words of encouragement. This is further supported by the fact the Krak-On Splat Roller has the Kraken as its special weapon in Splatoon and the Kraken Royale as its special weapon in Splatoon 3."
