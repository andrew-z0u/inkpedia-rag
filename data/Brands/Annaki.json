    "Annaki is a gear brand in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3. In Splatoon 2, Annaki gear has a 5× chance to roll Main Power Up (formerly Cold-Blooded before its removal in the version 4.3.0 update) as a secondary ability, and a 0.5× chance of rolling Special Saver. In Splatoon 3, Annaki gear has a 5× chance to roll Ink Saver (Sub) as a secondary ability, and a 0.5× chance of rolling Special Saver.",
    "Annaki gear is inspired by the post-punk culture and fashion commonly associated with anarchist movements.",
    "The Annaki logo appears to be a stylized squid or Jellyfish inside a circle, forming a loose \"A\". A capital \"A\" enclosed in a circle is also a traditional symbol of anarchism.",
    "For the category page, see Category:Annaki.",
    "Reaching a cumulative amount of stars on Annaki gear will reward the player with badges.",
    "Annaki sounds similar to \"anarchy\" (especially in non-rhotic dialects), which references the fact that it is inspired by anarchist movements.",
