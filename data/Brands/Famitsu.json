The winning design was based on a traditional Japanese chef outfit and was added to Splatoon as the Traditional Headband, Traditional Apron and the Traditional Sandals in version 2.0.0. Also, the development staff of Splatoon and the staff at Famitsu selected three runners-up each. The ones selected by the Splatoon developers received a poster with signatures from the team, while the ones selected by Famitsu received a poster by Takahashi Kino, the author of the Mellow Squid 4-Panel Comic.[2]\n\nIn a July 2017 issue, the Famitsu magazine held the Squid Fashion Contest 2017, which allowed readers to submit gear designs for a chance at having the design added to Splatoon 2. The winning design, called Ghillie Suit Style, was added to the game in version 2.0.0, appearing as the Moist Ghillie Helmet, Moist Ghillie Suit and Moist Ghillie Boots. These were produced by Forge rather than the Famitsu brand.\n\nSquid Fashion Contest 2017 also allowed the submission of graffiti. The winning design, Noshi Ika Graffiti, was added to the game, appearing in Walleye Warehouse.[3]\n\n- Traditional Gear, the winning design of Squid Fashion Contest 2015\n\n- Ghillie Suit Style, the winning gear design of Squid Fashion Contest 2017\n\n- Noshi Ika Graffiti, the winning graffiti design of Squid Fashion Contest 2017\n\n- Splatoon strategy guide\n\n- Mellow Squid 4-Panel Comic\n\n- Front cover of Weekly Famitsu (1 August 2019)\n\n- Cover art\n\n- Front cover of Weekly Famitsu (11 June 2020)\n\n- Cover art\n\n- Front cover of Weekly Famitsu (26 September 2024)\n\n- Cover art\n\nFor the category page, see Category:Famitsu.\n\n- Inkling girls and boys wearing the Traditional Gear.\n\n- An Inkling girl wearing the Traditional Gear.\n\n- Famitsu is the only gear brand in Splatoon to feature fan-made gear.\n\n- Since this brand makes one set, the only abilities it has are Comeback, Quick Respawn, and Run Speed Up.\n\n- Promotional gear"
