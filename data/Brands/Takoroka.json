Takoroka gear has a 5× chance of rolling Special Charge Up, and a 0.5× chance of rolling Special Duration Up in Splatoon or Special Power Up in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3.\n\nTakoroka's theme appears to be clothing for active, fit Inklings. This can be by some of their clothing, like modern-style running shoes, a vector patterned shirt and a mesh cap for blocking sunlight. However, they also produce sports clothing, such as rugby shirts and studded soccer shoes.\n\nAccording to the SplatoonJP Twitter, Takoroka mainly produces many pairs of shoes, and also professional sportswear like rugby shirts and spiked shoes.
