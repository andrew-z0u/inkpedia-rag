Tentatek makes a variety of gear and has designed three weapons: the Tentatek Splattershot (in collaboration with Splat), Dark Tetra Dualies, and Light Tetra Dualies. Their gear has a 5× chance of rolling Ink Recovery Up as a sub ability and a 0.5× chance of rolling Quick Super Jump.\n\nAccording to SplatoonJP, Tentatek produces sportswear and athletic shoes,[1] with their brightly colored, high-tech trainers and Sea Slugs popular among young Inklings.[2]\n\n- 1 Logo\n\n- 2 Gear\n\n- 3 Weapons\n\n- 4 Label\n\n- 5 Quotes\n\n5.1 Splatoon\n5.2 Splatoon 2\n5.3 Splatoon 3\n5.4 Splatoon Base\n\n- 5.1 Splatoon\n\n- 5.2 Splatoon 2\n\n- 5.3 Splatoon 3\n\n- 5.4 Splatoon Base\n\n- 6 Badges\n\n- 7 Gallery\n\n- 8 Trivia\n\n- 9 Names in other languages\n\n- 10 References\n\n- 5.1 Splatoon\n\n- 5.2 Splatoon 2\n\n- 5.3 Splatoon 3\n\n- 5.4 Splatoon Base\n\nIn Splatoon, the Tentatek logo consists of a hot pink (deep cerise) oval with a white horizontal figure 8 shape (resembling the \"eye mask\" Inklings have on their face) inside it and the Inkling wordmark below it in the same hot pink color. The wordmark seems to be a very stylized round script, mimicking the letters \"AROME\" (the brand's Japanese name), and ends with an Inkling rendition of the trademark symbol.\n\nIn Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3, Tentatek's logo is slightly simplified, having only the figure 8 shape in the same previous hot pink color and the trademark symbol in the bottom-right corner of the icon. However, returning gear from the original Splatoon retains the old logo and the wordmark are used in some in-universe Tentatek promotions.\n\nFor the category page, see Category:Tentatek.\n\n- Tentatek Splattershot (collaboration with \"Splat\")\n\n- Dark Tetra Dualies\n Light Tetra Dualies\n\n- Light Tetra Dualies\n\n- Light Tetra Dualies\n\nTentatek has gear with the labels 'Iromaki 750', 'Norimaki 750' and 'Sea Slug'.\n\nReaching a cumulative amount of stars on Tentatek gear will reward the player with badges.\n\n- Tentatek promotional image in Splatoon\n\n- An Inkling wearing a full set of Tentatek gear\n\n- Render of one of the Neon Sea Slugs\n\n- A Splatoon 2 promotional poster of Tentatek gear\n\n- A promotional collage of Tentatek gear\n\n- Information from The Art of Splatoon 2\n\n- Marina wearing unnamed Tentatek shoes in the art for the Hero vs. Villain Splatfest\n\n- The mem cake of Tentatek logo\n\n- A magazine of Tentatek gear from Splatoon 3\n\n- The Tentatek promotion used for SplatNet 3's daily drops.\n\n- Promotional image for Splatoon 3\n\n- The passion-fruit water bottle locker decoration\n\n- The writing underneath the logo is similar to its translated Japanese name, 'Arome'.\n\n- In Splatoon, there is no Tentatek gear that has Bomb Sniffer, Haunt, Ink Recovery Up, Ink Saver (Main), Ink Saver (Sub), Last-Ditch Effort, Ninja Squid, Opening Gambit, Recon, Special Duration Up, or Swim Speed Up as a primary ability.\n\n- In Splatoon 2, there is no Tentatek gear that has Haunt, Ink Recovery Up, Ninja Squid, or Opening Gambit as a primary ability.\n\n- In art for the Hero vs. Villain Splatfest, Marina wears a pair of Tentatek shoes unavailable to players. They are similar to Sesame Salt 270s but are mainly dark gray with white and teal accents.\n\n- It seems Tentatek is also a seller of soda named Tentacola, according to dialogue between Pearl and Marina for Ancho-V Games, Musselforge Fitness, and Skipper Pavilion. In other languages, it is named Tentatek Cola, a clear indication that it is Tentatek branded.\n\n- Marina's 8-based outfits bear a resemblance to the sideways 8 on Tentatek clothing and the Tentatek logo."
