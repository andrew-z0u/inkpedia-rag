SquidForce items have 5× chance to roll Damage Up in Splatoon and Ink Resistance Up in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3, and a 0.5× chance to roll Ink Saver (Main).\n\nAccording to SplatoonJP, SquidForce produces simple and mobile clothing.[1]\n\n- 1 Gear\n\n- 2 Weapons\n\n- 3 Quotes\n\n3.1 Splatoon\n3.2 Splatoon 2\n3.3 Splatoon 3\n3.4 Splatoon Base\n\n- 3.1 Splatoon\n\n- 3.2 Splatoon 2\n\n- 3.3 Splatoon 3\n\n- 3.4 Splatoon Base\n\n- 4 Badges\n\n- 5 Gallery\n\n- 6 Trivia\n\n- 7 Names in other languages\n\n- 8 References\n\n- 3.1 Splatoon\n\n- 3.2 Splatoon 2\n\n- 3.3 Splatoon 3\n\n- 3.4 Splatoon Base\n\nFor the category page, see Category:SquidForce.\n\n- Ultra Stamp (collaboration with Nouveau)\n\nReaching a cumulative amount of stars on SquidForce gear will reward the player with badges.\n\nBy collecting all gear offered from Switch News Channel entries enough stars can be collected to immediately receive the 30 stars badge.\n\n- SquidForce promotional image.\n\n- Information from The Art of Splatoon 2.\n\n- A promotional image from The Art of Splatoon 2.\n\n- An Inkling wearing SquidForce headgear and clothing, with the logo on the Squidmark Sweat.\n\n- Two posters with the SquidForce logo in Arowana Mall.\n\n- The mem cake of SquidForce.\n\n- The SquidForce logo above the entrance to the lobby in Splatoon 3.\n\n- Magazines of SquidForce gear from Splatoon 3.\n\n- The SquidForce promotional image seen in SplatNet 3 daily drops.\n\n- Promotional image for Splatoon 3.\n\n- As confirmed by Squid Research Lab, SquidForce is the official sponsor for battles. Their logo can be seen on the button to select Turf Wars as well as on the sides of the tower in Tower Control, while their anchor logo is used for both the button for Ranked Battles and the map icon for Ranked Battle objectives. Additionally, three of the six total pieces of starting gear across all games and the Splatfest Tees are produced by SquidForce.\n\n- SquidForce's logo seems to be illustrating a one-on-one battle between two Inklings, possibly because it is a battle sponsor. This could possibly just be a squid take on an X.\n\n- In Splatoon, there is no SquidForce gear that has Bomb Sniffer, Comeback, Damage Up, Ink Resistance Up, Last-Ditch Effort, Opening Gambit, Stealth Jump, Swim Speed Up, or Tenacity as a primary ability.\n\n- In Splatoon 2, there is no SquidForce gear that has Drop Roller, Ink Resistance Up, Last-Ditch Effort, Opening Gambit, Stealth Jump or, Tenacity as a primary ability.\n\n- SquidForce is one of the first brands that players are introduced to, due to the status of the White Headband, the Basic Tee, and (in Splatoon 3) the Tri-Shred Tee as pieces of starting gear for new players.\n\n- The Party Hard Hat has SquidForce stickers on it even though it is made by Forge."
