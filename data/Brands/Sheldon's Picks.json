    "Sheldon's Picks are a set of reskins of existing weapons with new sub and special weapons, exclusive to Splatoon and Splatoon 2. They are each the third variation of their respective main weapon (excluding single-player reskins), and are all Sheldon's Picks-branded.",
    "Sheldon's Picks were first announced during the 3 March 2016 Nintendo Direct presentation and were released in two volumes. The first came on 13 April 2016 as part of version 2.7.0 and the second was added on 8 June 2016 part of version 2.8.0.[2] All of them are unlocked at Level 20, with the Tempered Dynamo Roller and Aerospray PG also requiring the fifth and third Boss Scrolls, respectively.",
    "In Splatoon 2, Sheldon's Picks' role as the series of third variations of weapons initially seemed to be taken by the Kensa Collection. However, on 27 January 2019 at the fourth Splatoon Koshien Tokaigi championships, it was announced that all weapons that appeared in Sheldon's Picks in Splatoon but did not receive a third variation in the Kensa Collection will return in Splatoon 2 in a future update.[3] The announcement also contained new renders of the returning weapons and was later published on social media.[4]",
    "On 30 March 2019, it was announced that Sheldon's Picks would be added to the game in version 4.6.0, released on 2 April 2019. The same announcement also revealed two brand-new weapons added to the set, as variants of weapons that did not exist in Splatoon.[5]",

    "- In both games featuring it, Sheldon's Picks was announced after a previous weapon or set of weapons was purported to be the final one: the Custom Hydra Splatling in Splatoon, and the fourth and final Kensa Collection, the Custom Explosher, Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau, Bloblobber Deco, and Nautilus 79 in Splatoon 2.",
