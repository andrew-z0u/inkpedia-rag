The first came on 13 April 2016 as part of version 2.7.0 and the second was added on 8 June 2016 part of version 2.8.0.[2] All of them are unlocked at Level 20, with the Tempered Dynamo Roller and Aerospray PG also requiring the fifth and third Boss Scrolls, respectively.\n\nIn Splatoon 2, Sheldon's Picks' role as the series of third variations of weapons initially seemed to be taken by the Kensa Collection. However, on 27 January 2019 at the fourth Splatoon Koshien Tokaigi championships, it was announced that all weapons that appeared in Sheldon's Picks in Splatoon but did not receive a third variation in the Kensa Collection will return in Splatoon 2 in a future update.[3] The announcement also contained new renders of the returning weapons and was later published on social media.[4]\n\nOn 30 March 2019, it was announced that Sheldon's Picks would be added to the game in version 4.6.0, released on 2 April 2019. The same announcement also revealed two brand-new weapons added to the set, as variants of weapons that did not exist in Splatoon.[5]\n\n- The border of the Sheldon's Picks logo resembles the border of the Nintendo Seal of Quality.\n\n- The logo seen on the boxes of Sheldon's Picks weapons appears to be a bilingual ambigram of \"WEApoN\" and ブキセット buki setto (weapon set).\n\n- The Inkling on the Volume 2 box art in Splatoon appears as an alternate costume for Inkling in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.\n\n- 6 of the 10 returning Sheldon's Picks weapons in Splatoon 2 kept the same sub weapon between games.\nThe N-ZAP '83, Heavy Splatling Remix, and Permanent Inkbrush inherited subs that had been previously used by their Splatoon alternate kits.\n\n- The N-ZAP '83, Heavy Splatling Remix, and Permanent Inkbrush inherited subs that had been previously used by their Splatoon alternate kits.\n\n- In both games featuring it, Sheldon's Picks was announced after a previous weapon or set of weapons was purported to be the final one: the Custom Hydra Splatling in Splatoon, and the fourth and final Kensa Collection, the Custom Explosher, Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau, Bloblobber Deco, and Nautilus 79 in Splatoon 2.\n\n- The N-ZAP '83, Heavy Splatling Remix, and Permanent Inkbrush inherited subs that had been previously used by their Splatoon alternate kits.\n\n- A version with the ?
