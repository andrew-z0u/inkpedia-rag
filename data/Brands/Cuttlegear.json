A Sunken Scroll in Splatoon 3 features an official document of the New Squidbeak Splatoon with the Cuttlegear logo on it, seemingly confirming this connection.\n\nIn Splatoon, the brand has an entirely black logo, depicting a stylized squid icon surrounded by circular \"waves\", with two Bamboozlers arranged in a crossbones-esque way underneath the squid icon.\n\nBeginning in Splatoon 2, the logo has changed from black to a dark navy blue, though it is otherwise identical.\n\nFor the category page, see Category:Cuttlegear.\n\nDespite being created by Sheldon as a homage to Cap'n Cuttlefish and his own grandfather, 2 weapons under the Ammo Knights and Sheldon's Picks brands are marked with Cuttlegear stickers:\n\n- Bamboozler 14 Mk II (with the same sticker also appearing in the bottom right corner of the weapon icon)\n\n- Bamboozler 14 Mk III\n\nHowever, the Recycled Brella 24 Mk II has the Sorella brand.\n\n- Recycled Brella 24 Mk II\n\n- Cuttlegear's black logo, as seen in Splatoon.\n\n- Vertical version of the logo.\n\n- An Inkling wearing Cuttlegear gear. The brand logo is visible on the Legendary Cap and Bamboozler 14 Mk II.\n\n- Another Inkling wearing Cuttlegear gear. The brand logo is also visible on the tag on the Octo Tee.\n\n- The Cuttlegear Logo on the back of the Old-Timey Hat.\n\n- The Cuttlegear logo on the Old-Timey Clothes gear's medallion.\n\n- The Cuttlegear logo on the Old-Timey Shoes.\n\n- The Cuttlegear logo on the Black Cuttlegear LS' tag.\n\n- The Cuttlegear logo on one of the Fresh Octo Tee's tags.\n\n- The Cuttlegear logo on the Octo Layered LS tag.\n\n- The Cuttlegear logo on the back of the Octarian Retro.\n\n- The Cuttlegear logo is also visible on the base of DJ Octavio's snowglobe.\n\n- The Cuttlegear logo is also seen around Tentakeel Outpost on banners and Cuttlefish Cabin.\n\n- The Cuttlegear logo on Marie's umbrella.\n\n- The Cuttlegear logo on a banner at Cuttlefish Cabin.\n\n- Gear introduced in Side Order is still produced by Cuttlegear, despite the New Squidbeak Splatoon being entirely uninvolved with its story.\n\n- Apart from the amiibo brand itself, Cuttlegear is the only other brand to produce gear provided by amiibo.\n\nCuttlegear is a portmanteau of \"Cuttlefish\" and \"gear\"."
