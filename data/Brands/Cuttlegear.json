    "Cuttlegear is a gear brand in the Splatoon series.",
    "Unlike most other brands, it does not have increased or decreased chances of getting certain abilities.",
    "Cuttlegear is a brand primarily dedicated to producing gear obtainable from single-player campaigns or other non-commercial sources, which cannot be purchased or ordered from another player, although version 3.0.0 in Splatoon 2 introduced Cuttlegear clothing for sale in shops.",
    "In Splatoon and Splatoon 2, Cuttlegear is heavily implied both by its name and produced gear items to be associated with Cap'n Cuttlefish and the New Squidbeak Splatoon. A Sunken Scroll in Splatoon 3 features an official document of the New Squidbeak Splatoon with the Cuttlegear logo on it, seemingly confirming this connection.",
    "In Splatoon, the brand has an entirely black logo, depicting a stylized squid icon surrounded by circular \"waves\", with two Bamboozlers arranged in a crossbones-esque way underneath the squid icon.",
    "Beginning in Splatoon 2, the logo has changed from black to a dark navy blue, though it is otherwise identical.",
    "For the category page, see Category:Cuttlegear.",
    "Despite being created by Sheldon as a homage to Cap'n Cuttlefish and his own grandfather, 2 weapons under the Ammo Knights and Sheldon's Picks brands are marked with Cuttlegear stickers:",
    "However, the Recycled Brella 24 Mk II has the Sorella brand.",
    "Cuttlegear is a portmanteau of \"Cuttlefish\" and \"gear\".",
