  "content": "Splash Mob is a gear brand within the Splatoon series. Splash Mob items have a 5× chance to roll Ink Saver (Main), while a 0.5× chance to roll Run Speed Up.\n\nSplash Mob's theme seems to be intellectual or formal gear, sometimes giving it a retro appearance. For instance, they offer such gear as a shirt and tie, a pair of retro-style glasses, and Velcro canvas shoes. The intellectual theme is continued with their school-inspired gear, such as college sweatshirts and a varsity baseball shirt.\n\n- 1 Gear\n\n- 2 Quotes\n\n2.1 Splatoon\n2.2 Splatoon 2\n2.3 Splatoon 3\n2.4 Splatoon Base\n\n- 2.1 Splatoon\n\n- 2.2 Splatoon 2\n\n- 2.3 Splatoon 3\n\n- 2.4 Splatoon Base\n\n- 3 Badges\n\n- 4 Gallery\n\n- 5 Trivia\n\n- 6 Etymology\n\n- 7 Names in other languages\n\n- 8 References\n\n- 2.1 Splatoon\n\n- 2.2 Splatoon 2\n\n- 2.3 Splatoon 3\n\n- 2.4 Splatoon Base\n\nFor the category page, see Category:Splash Mob.\n\nReaching a cumulative amount of stars on Splash Mob gear will reward the player with badges.\n\n- A promotional image of Splash Mob for Splatoon\n\n- An Inkling wearing a full set of Splash Mob gear\n\n- Another Inkling wearing a Splash Mob outfit.
