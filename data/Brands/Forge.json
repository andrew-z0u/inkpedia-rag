  "content": "Forge is a gear brand within the Splatoon series. In Splatoon, Forge gear has a 5× higher chance to roll Special Duration Up while in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3, it has a 5× higher chance to roll Special Power Up and a 0.5× chance to roll Ink Saver (Sub). Forge also designed the Forge Splattershot Pro.\n\nThough Forge's gear is quite varied in its appearance and style, their theme seems to be practical headgear. All of their headgear serves or is able to serve a particular function, such as a football helmet for protecting one's head, goggles for going swimming, and headphones for listening to music.\n\nAccording to SplatoonJP, Forge produces military-style clothing and professional headphones.[1]\n\n- 1 Logo\n\n- 2 Gear\n\n- 3 Weapons\n\n- 4 Label\n\n- 5 Quotes\n\n5.1 Splatoon\n5.2 Splatoon 2\n5.3 Splatoon 3\n5.4 Splatoon Base\n\n- 5.1 Splatoon\n\n- 5.2 Splatoon 2\n\n- 5.3 Splatoon 3\n\n- 5.4 Splatoon Base\n\n- 6 Badges\n\n- 7 Gallery\n\n- 8 Trivia\n\n- 9 Names in other languages\n\n- 10 References\n\n- 5.1 Splatoon\n\n- 5.2 Splatoon 2\n\n- 5.3 Splatoon 3\n\n- 5.4 Splatoon Base\n\nThe Forge logo is a lettermark or letterform. It consists of a black circle, with an italicized F-shape inside, stylized to resemble a Splattershot. The F-shape is split into three parts - the bottom being the stem of the F, it is transparent and extends outside the edge of the circle, and has an attached shape that resembles the trigger guard of Splatoon's Splattershot. The middle and top portions are parallelograms that make up the middle bar and top arm of the F, with the middle being a transparent outline filled black, with an attached shape to resemble the barrel, and the top being solid yellow, representing the ink tank.\n\nIn Splatoon, there is bold and italicized black Inkling text below the logo, with the second letter ('o' shape) filled with the same yellow used in the logo. It is seemingly very stylized round script or bold script, mimicking the letters \"Forリマ\", which is similar to the brand's name in Japanese (フォーリマ Fōrima). This text does not appear on the main logo in the subsequent games, though it does still appear on some versions of it, and on some gear.\n\nFor the category page, see Category:Forge.\n\n- Forge Splattershot Pro (collaboration with \"Splat\")\n\nForge has gear with the label 'Deca'.\n\nReaching a cumulative amount of stars on Forge gear will reward the player with badges.\n\n- Forge promotional image.\n\n- Information from The Art of Splatoon 2.\n\n- A promotional image from The Art of Splatoon 2.\n\n- A magazine of Forge gear from Splatoon 3.\n\n- Clean version with logo seen on SplatNet 3 Forge daily drops.\n\n- The Banner representing the Forge brand.\n\n- Promotional image for Splatoon 3.\n\n- In Splatoon, there is no Forge gear that has Bomb Sniffer, Cold Blooded, Ink Resistance Up, Ninja Squid, Quick Super Jump, Recon, Special Charge Up, Special Duration Up, or Stealth Jump as a primary ability.\n\n- In Splatoon 2, there is no Forge gear that has Drop Roller, Ninja Squid, Special Power Up, Stealth Jump, or Thermal Ink as a primary ability."
