Forge also designed the Forge Splattershot Pro.",
    "Though Forge's gear is quite varied in its appearance and style, their theme seems to be practical headgear. All of their headgear serves or is able to serve a particular function, such as a football helmet for protecting one's head, goggles for going swimming, and headphones for listening to music.",
    "According to SplatoonJP, Forge produces military-style clothing and professional headphones.[1]",
    "The Forge logo is a lettermark or letterform. It consists of a black circle, with an italicized F-shape inside, stylized to resemble a Splattershot. The F-shape is split into three parts - the bottom being the stem of the F, it is transparent and extends outside the edge of the circle, and has an attached shape that resembles the trigger guard of Splatoon's Splattershot. The middle and top portions are parallelograms that make up the middle bar and top arm of the F, with the middle being a transparent outline filled black, with an attached shape to resemble the barrel, and the top being solid yellow, representing the ink tank.",
    "In Splatoon, there is bold and italicized black Inkling text below the logo, with the second letter ('o' shape) filled with the same yellow used in the logo. It is seemingly very stylized round script or bold script, mimicking the letters \"Forリマ\", which is similar to the brand's name in Japanese (フォーリマ Fōrima). This text does not appear on the main logo in the subsequent games, though it does still appear on some versions of it, and on some gear.",
