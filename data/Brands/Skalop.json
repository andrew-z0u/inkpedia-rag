    "Skalop is a gear brand within the Splatoon series. Skalop gear has a 5× chance to roll Quick Respawn, and a 0.5× chance to roll Special Saver.",
    "Although Skalop's gear is varied in appearance and style, like Forge, their theme appears to be headgear and simple shirts. Some of their headgear appears to be licensed such as an official baseball cap, sport headgear used for protection such as a cycling helmet, and casual T-shirts.",
    "According to SplatoonJP, Skalop produces many items of headgear such as caps and helmets. Its baseball cap is one of its most popular items.[1]",
    "For the category page, see Category:Skalop.",
    "Reaching a cumulative amount of stars on Skalop gear will reward the player with badges.",
    "The name of the gear brand appears to be based on the word \"scallop\", a name given to several species of clam. This is evident by its logo, which resembles an open clam.",
