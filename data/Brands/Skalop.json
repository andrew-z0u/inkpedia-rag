  "content": "Skalop is a gear brand within the Splatoon series. Skalop gear has a 5× chance to roll Quick Respawn, and a 0.5× chance to roll Special Saver.\n\nAlthough Skalop's gear is varied in appearance and style, like Forge, their theme appears to be headgear and simple shirts. Some of their headgear appears to be licensed such as an official baseball cap, sport headgear used for protection such as a cycling helmet, and casual T-shirts.\n\nAccording to SplatoonJP, Skalop produces many items of headgear such as caps and helmets. Its baseball cap is one of its most popular items.[1]\n\n- 1 Gear\n\n- 2 Quotes\n\n2.1 Splatoon\n2.2 Splatoon 2\n2.3 Splatoon 3\n2.4 Splatoon Base\n\n- 2.1 Splatoon\n\n- 2.2 Splatoon 2\n\n- 2.3 Splatoon 3\n\n- 2.4 Splatoon Base\n\n- 3 Badges\n\n- 4 Gallery\n\n- 5 Trivia\n\n- 6 Etymology\n\n6.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 6.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 7 References\n\n- 2.1 Splatoon\n\n- 2.2 Splatoon 2\n\n- 2.3 Splatoon 3\n\n- 2.4 Splatoon Base\n\n- 6.1 Names in other languages\n\nFor the category page, see Category:Skalop.\n\nReaching a cumulative amount of stars on Skalop gear will reward the player with badges.\n\n- Skalop promotional image.\n\n- Information from The Art of Splatoon 2.\n\n- Promotional image for Splatoon 2.\n\n- A promotional image from The Art of Splatoon 2.\n\n- An Inkling wearing a Skalop hat and shirt.\n\n- The Mem cake of Skalop.

This is evident by its logo, which resembles an open clam."
