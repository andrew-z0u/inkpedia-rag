Once it finds a spot close to a player, it will land and use its umbrella as a shield, from which it will aim. The Drizzler will fire a floating projectile, resembling a Torpedo, which will rain down ink similarly to an Ink Storm once it bursts. The recoil from its weapon causes the Drizzler to flip upside-down after firing, leaving itself vulnerable to being splatted. Shooting a projectile will deflect it, which can defeat the Drizzler upon a direct hit. While flying, its tail is exposed, rendering it susceptible to attack. Additionally, if a Drizzler is on uneven terrain, players can shoot under its umbrella while it is stationary and shielded.\n\nThe following text is quoted from the Salmonid Field Guide.\n\n- A flying fighter specializing in surprise attacks.\n\n- Covered in armor that renders it essentially impervious to ink.\n\n- Fires midrange attacks using special projectiles.\n\n- These projectiles explode into a shower of ink.\n\n- It is susceptible to attack immediately after it fires.\n\n- With good timing, it's possible to reflect the shot and hit the Drizzler with its own projectile, taking it down in one go.\n\n- The ranks of the Drizzlers are made up by renegade Salmonid who prefer to go it alone and fight on their own terms.\n\n- Well-protected against ink by unusual umbrella-like armor.\n\n- The immense recoil from discharging its weapon temporarily exposes the Salmonid within its armor.\n\n- Drizzlers land at predetermined spots, allowing experienced players to ambush them as they land at the next spot.\n\n- Drizzlers travel toward the nearest player upon take-off, which can be used to lure them near the Egg Basket for quick Golden Egg collection.\nWhen using this technique, do not enter their firing distance or they will fire torpedoes before further approaching.\n\n- When using this technique, do not enter their firing distance or they will fire torpedoes before further approaching.\n\n- Drizzlers will target said nearest player when firing projectiles. If possible, the target should be positioned away from the rest of the crew or towards the sea to minimize Ink Storm damage and enemy ink coverage.\n\n- Players can determine where the Drizzler will fire its Ink Storm projectile by observing where its scope points.\nA Drizzler projectile has 100 HP. Upon depleting its HP, the projectile flies downwards facing the same direction as the player at that time. In order to deflect the projectile back at the Drizzler, players need to align themselves so that the projectile lines up between them and the Drizzler or it will miss. Therefore, players should move where they see the Drizzler pointing its scope.\nFor slow traveling weapons like the Grizzco Slosher, even if the projectile is hit at a slightly off direction, as long as the player is aligned correctly before the projectile is hit, it will still hit the Drizzler.\n\n- A Drizzler projectile has 100 HP.
