Steel Eels are very long, making it easy to get cornered. The jerrycans on its body can instantly kill players with direct hits and block attacks. The only way to destroy this machine is to splat the Salmonid piloting it at the rear.\n\nThe following text is quoted from the Salmonid Field Guide.\n\n- It's a weapon made of connected ink-spraying devices for the suppression of large areas.\n\n- It locks on to and relentlessly pursues a single target.\n\n- Its extensive length is used to block routes as it rains down ink.\n\n- It can be neutralized by shooting the driver in the very rear of the Steel Eel.\n\n- The driver of the Steel Eel wears a mask to protect itself from the spray generated by the machine.\n\n- The great length of the Steel Eel is attributable to the large number of interconnected ink sprayers used to create it.\n\n- Upon spawning, a Steel Eel will target the player that takes the least amount of time for it to reach and is not already targeted by a Steel Eel (unless all alive players are already targeted by other Steel Eels). It will continue to chase this player until they are splatted or move to certain unreachable locations, such as propeller lifts. After this, it will target another player using the same logic.\nThe player being targeted should coordinate their movement with the other player's location, keeping players safe and exposing the Steel Eel's weak point to them.\nIf the targeted player travels behind the Steel Eel, the Steel Eel will do a U-turn and potentially trap the player.\nThe Steel Eel's pilot looks directly at the player it is targeting, which can be used to tell who is being targeted.\nIf a player is being chased and gets on a propeller platform, the chased player uses a Booyah Bomb, or the chased player is splatted, the Steel Eel will immediately start chasing another player.\n\n- The player being targeted should coordinate their movement with the other player's location, keeping players safe and exposing the Steel Eel's weak point to them.\n\n- If the targeted player travels behind the Steel Eel, the Steel Eel will do a U-turn and potentially trap the player.\n\n- The Steel Eel's pilot looks directly at the player it is targeting, which can be used to tell who is being targeted.\n\n- If a player is being chased and gets on a propeller platform, the chased player uses a Booyah Bomb, or the chased player is splatted, the Steel Eel will immediately start chasing another player.\n\n- Steel Eels are tall enough that they are still capable of splatting Inkjet users. However, players are capable of getting over a Steel Eel if they boost.\n\n- Steel Eels are tall enough that they are still capable of splatting someone using a Booyah Bomb. The Steel Eel can completely shred through the armor, so players should be careful when activating a Booyah Bomb when close to a Steel Eel.\n\n- The Ink coming from a Steel Eel can destroy a Wave Breaker if it is placed in the path it is taking, so it is advised on placing the Wave Breaker on an advantageous spot the Steel Eel cannot access or where the boss is not headed through.\n\n- On certain stages, Steel Eels can spawn in the water with the pilot's head partially above water as the body extends out. Players can splat them far quicker this way, which can help during High Tides in neutralizing their threat before they start taking up space.\n\n- Splat Bombs explode instantly on contact with the Steel Eel's ink spray. Players can use this to their advantage if they want to quickly dispatch weaker or weakened Salmonids.\n\n- Steel Eels drop their eggs where the pilot is located.\nWhen luring a Steel Eel towards the basket, players should make sure the Steel Eel is destroyed when the pilot is closest to the basket.\n\n- When luring a Steel Eel towards the basket, players should make sure the Steel Eel is destroyed when the pilot is closest to the basket.\n\n- The player being targeted should coordinate their movement with the other player's location, keeping players safe and exposing the Steel Eel's weak point to them.\n\n- If the targeted player travels behind the Steel Eel, the Steel Eel will do a U-turn and potentially trap the player.\n\n- The Steel Eel's pilot looks directly at the player it is targeting, which can be used to tell who is being targeted.\n\n- If a player is being chased and gets on a propeller platform, the chased player uses a Booyah Bomb, or the chased player is splatted, the Steel Eel will immediately start chasing another player.\n\n- When luring a Steel Eel towards the basket, players should make sure the Steel Eel is destroyed when the pilot is closest to the basket.\n\nSplatting Steel Eels a specific number of times in Salmon Run Next Wave will reward the player with special badges that they can use on their Splashtag.\n\n- Render\n\n- 3D artwork\n\n- A Steel Eel slinking away from the shoreline.\n\n- Close-up of the pilot of the Steel Eel.\n\n- A Steel Eel about to splat an Inkling.\n\n- A Steel Eel in the tutorial.\n\n- A Steel Eel after moving closer to its target.\n\n- A Steel Eel surrounded by Chums.\n\n- The Salmonid Field Guide entry for the Steel Eel in Splatoon 2.\n\n- The Salmonid Field Guide entry for the Steel Eel in Splatoon 3.\n\n- The Salmonid Field Guide entry for the Steel Eel in Splatoon 3.\n\n- The illustration in the field guide.\n\n- The mem cake of a Steel Eel.\n\n- Unofficial render of the Steel Eel's game model from Splatoon 2.\n\n- Concept art of the Steel Eel from The Art of Splatoon 2.\n\n- The icon for the Steel Eel used in SplatNet 2 and in the Splatoon 2 relationship chart.\n\n- The Steel Eel's icon in Splatoon 3.\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Steel Eel.\n\n- The Steel Eel locker decoration.\n\n- The mask worn by the Salmonid driver of a Steel Eel is a typical mask worn in Japan when a person is ill.\n\n- The pilot of the Steel Eel has a reflective marking on its fin that resembles a stylized Golden Egg.\n\n- Its design could be a reference to the real-life Eurypharynx pelecanoides, also known as the pelican or gulper eel."
