It spawns with a Big Shot launcher near the shoreline and fires a cannonball that will land near the egg basket. The cannonball then bounces up and down in a similar fashion to the Wave Breaker. However, the projectile sends off two shock waves before breaking, while the Wave Breaker emits three. The Big Shot itself has considerably high health, but cannot attack directly and merely travels to and from the water to load cannonballs into the launcher. The launcher cannot be broken and will remain until the end of the wave, similarly to the pillar of the Fish Stick.\n\nEven before the Big Shot is defeated, players can use its Big Shot launcher to fire Golden Eggs toward the egg basket. If multiple Big Shots spawn in a wave, they will all use the same launcher.\n\nThe following text is quoted from the Salmonid Field Guide.[1]\n\nBasic Information\n\n- These set up a Big Shot launcher near the shore. The Big Shot launcher is loaded with cannonballs carried in from the sea, which it then fires.\n\n- The attending Salmonid itself is not aggressive—it just passively goes back and forth between the sea and the Big Shot launcher.\n\n- The Big Shot launcher can be used to load and fire Golden Eggs.\n\n- After the Big Shot is defeated, the Big Shot launcher will stick around until the next wave.\n\nAttack Behavior\n\n- It will fire its cannonballs in the direction of the egg basket.\n\n- When a cannonball lands, it creates two shock-wave attacks.\n\nElimination\n\n- Take out the Salmonid operating the Big Shot launcher.\n\nSupporting Information\n\n- Among muscle-bound Salmonids, those with belligerent personalities tend to be assigned as Steelheads, while those with calmer dispositions are assigned to Big Shots.\n\n- On Salmonid holidays, Big Shot workers like to launch special fireworks in place of cannonballs to make things more festive.\n\n- Load any nearby Golden Eggs in the Big Shot Launcher to fire them toward the basket. The launcher is very useful for getting eggs closer to the basket, but be sure another player is there to pick them up, otherwise Snatchers may steal them before they can be collected.\nAvoid spending too much time around the Big Shot Launcher, as staying near the shore can be dangerous.\nEggs can also be fired from the cannon during an Xtrawave, functioning the same as a normal wave. This allows players to relocate groups of eggs to the basket if needed.\n\n- Avoid spending too much time around the Big Shot Launcher, as staying near the shore can be dangerous.\n\n- Eggs can also be fired from the cannon during an Xtrawave, functioning the same as a normal wave.
