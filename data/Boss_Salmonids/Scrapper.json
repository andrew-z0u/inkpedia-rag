The only way to splat a Scrapper is to shoot its tail, which is located behind it. Dealing 600 damage to the shield with stun it, exposing its tail for roughly five seconds. Players should use this time to splat the Scrapper. If one player shoots the Scrapper, it will stop moving and face its shield against this player, allowing other players to attack from behind.\n\nIf the player shoots the Scrapper but does not stun it, it will take around two seconds from the last shot before it starts moving again. If the player stuns it but does not splat it, it will take around five seconds before its shield is repaired and it starts moving again.\n\nThe following text is quoted from the Salmonid Field Guide.\n\n- Protected against almost all ink damage by their shields.\n\n- Their ability to turn rapidly allows them to keep their shields facing their target.\n\n- The protection afforded by their shields allows them to charge forwards.\n\n- Sustained ink attacks will damage their shields and bring them to a standstill.\n\n- Once the Scrapper is immobilized, move round behind it to fire through the chink in its armor and take it out.\n\n- The Scrapper's vehicle is a much-desired item for many Salmonids.\n\n- The shields are made from odds and ends of scrap metal.\n\n- If the shields are broken, the Scrapper will have to stop in order to make repairs.\n\n- Scrappers move much faster than than other bosses, allowing them to be lured to the basket much easier than other Boss Salmonids.\n\n- The Sting Ray, Killer Wail 5.1, Booyah Bomb, Triple Inkstrike, Grizzco Slosher, and Grizzco Splatana ignore the Scrappers' armor.\n\n- Scrappers will target the closest player until they are shot, after which they will follow the player that last shot them. This can be used to redirect Scrappers toward the basket if they are following someone further away from it.\n\nSplatting Scrappers a specific number of times in Salmon Run Next Wave will reward the player with special badges that they can use on their Splashtag.\n\n- Splatoon 2 render.\n\n- Splatoon 2 render (page scan).\n\n- Splatoon 3 render.\n\n- A scrapper with a Chum following behind it.\n\n- An immobilized Scrapper.\n\n- The back of a Scrapper.\n\n- The Salmonid Field Guide entry for the Scrapper in Splatoon 2.\n\n- The Salmonid Field Guide entry for the Scrapper in Splatoon 3.\n\n- The Salmonid Field Guide entry for the Scrapper in Splatoon 3.\n\n- The illustration in the field guide.\n\n- The mem cake of a Scrapper.\n\n- Unofficial render of the Scrapper's game model from Splatoon 2.\n\n- The icon for the Scrapper used in SplatNet 2.\n\n- The Scrapper's icon in Splatoon 3.\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Scrapper.\n\n- The Scrapper locker decoration.\n\n- Two Scrappers on Jammin' Salmon Junction.\n\n- The windshield of the Scrapper's vehicle appears to be a modified version of the shield used by Shielded Octotroopers, with the windshield, exhaust pipes, and front roller attached to a car engine. This is further suggested by the looping five-note jingle that the car horn plays when the Scrapper is stunned, which is similar to that heard in numerous Turquoise October songs such as Eight-Legged Advance, Octo Eight-Step, and Story Mode: Onward!."
