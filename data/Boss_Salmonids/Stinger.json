Stingers will aim for the player furthest away from them when they begin firing. Stingers typically appear close to the shorelines but can move around rather slowly. Stingers always appear on a stack of seven cooking pots placed on top of a gas burner. To defeat them, players must shoot the pots to knock them off of the stack until the Stinger lands on the burner. Their attacks are much more accurate than a player-controlled Sting Ray and can take out an Inkling or Octoling within a few seconds if they cannot dodge it, so players should focus their attention on this Salmonid in particular.\n\nIn Splatoon 3's Salmonid Field Guide, it is revealed that some Smallfry that make up Fish Sticks are recruited to become Stingers due to their lung capacity training.\n\nThe following text is quoted from the Salmonid Field Guide.\n\n- A Salmonid sniper atop a stack of pots and pans.\n\n- Not known to move from the beach.\n\n- The Salmonid on top can't be harmed with ink-based attacks.\n\n- Attacks from a distance with powerful jets of ink that can pass through walls and other obstacles.\n\n- Use your ink to knock pots away one at a time until the Salmonid lands on the flame below.\n\n- Boils ink in its pots to generate the pressure required for its long-range attacks.\n\n- The pots are stacked high on top of a gas burner to allow the Stinger to effectively sight and attack enemies from a distance.\n\n- The Salmonid on top wears protective equipment to absorb the shock from the jet of ink.\n\n- Weapons that have fast attack speeds or deal area damage are best suited to defeat Stingers quickly. Shooters, blasters, and splatlings are all excellent options. On the contrary, weapons such as rollers, shorter-ranged sloshers, and chargers that only take out one pot at a time are left vulnerable while lowering Stingers and should focus on other targets.\nAn exception to this is the Sloshing Machine, which can hit multiple pots with its splash damage. The Grizzco Slosher, being a modified Sloshing Machine, can do the same and even take out an entire Stinger in one slosh by aiming such that the projectile falls down through the stack of pots.\nIn the case of most chargers, Stingers can be defeated moderately effectively by using a very small amount of charge to attack each pot; an uncharged shot has a base damage of 50, so it does not take long to build charge up to a pot's health of 60. The Bamboozler 14 Mk I, Goo Tuber, and Snipewriter 5H, however, have enough base damage to destroy a pot with an uncharged shot, so Stingers can be defeated by simply quickly tapping the fire button.\nRollers have a large enough hitbox to hit most of the pots by rolling into them, allowing for a Stinger to be quickly attacked by standing near it with the roller down and spinning in place. However, the hurtbox of the highest, smallest pot is too small to be attacked in this way by most rollers. On a roller with enough range, this can be remedied by using the initial swing to attack the top pot first before rolling over the rest. Use caution with this technique, as a Stinger's usual placement near the water and a spawn point will make it easy to be quickly overrun by lesser Salmonids and pushed off the stage.\n\n- An exception to this is the Sloshing Machine, which can hit multiple pots with its splash damage.

The same applies to the explosion from a Reefslider. It is best to use these specials if there are multiple Stingers close together or if the player is cornered and/or surrounded.\n\n- Using a Sting Ray to eliminate Stingers from a distance works well unless the user is their target. The Killer Wail 5.1 can be used to similar effect while leaving the user less vulnerable, although it can be more difficult to aim.\n\n- Using an Inkjet is also highly effective given that it provides the user safety from most Salmonids, it can kill a Stinger in one shot, and it can pick up an egg with a free Super Jump back to the basket. It can also defeat any Flyfish in the area, which are equally high-priority targets.\n\n- The Crab Tank can also destroy a Stinger in one cannon shot, or with sustained normal fire, but is much riskier as it has relatively low mobility and its armor is pierced by the Stinger's attack.\n\n- An exception to this is the Sloshing Machine, which can hit multiple pots with its splash damage.
