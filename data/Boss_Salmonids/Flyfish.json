    "Flyfish are Boss Salmonids that appear in Salmon Run and Salmon Run Next Wave.",
    "Flyfish consist of a single Smallfry piloting an Inkjet-like contraption to fly around. Periodically, the Flyfish stops in place and opens its two launchers, each of which launches up to 4 missiles similar to Tenta Missiles; these can lock on to up to two players at a time. A direct hit from a missile results in an instant splat. Flyfish are invulnerable to the vast majority of conventional attacks, and players will generally instead need to land a Splat Bomb or another variety of exploding projectile into each launcher when they are open (or attack the Smallfry pilot directly within its cockpit using one of the specific alternatives listed in Statistics below). When the missile launchers are destroyed, the Flyfish will spin out of control and crash on the ground, exploding and dropping its Golden Eggs.",
    "The Flyfish's missiles target the players in the direction it is facing, with the red launcher's missiles targeting the closest player in view, and the blue launcher's missiles randomly targeting another active player. This is only true if both launchers are present: if one of the launchers was destroyed in a prior attack cycle, the remaining launcher will always target the closest player in its view. A player can destroy both launchers if they are both quick enough and have enough ink for two bombs, or if they use a well-placed bomb explosion to hit both launchers at the same time.",
    "The following text is quoted from the Salmonid Field Guide.",
    "- Each flank is equipped with missile launchers capable of firing up to four missiles each.",
    "- Uses jet propulsion technology to hover about.",
    "- Covered in ink-repelling armor.",
    "- Capable of locking on to two targets and firing up to four missiles from each missile launcher.",
    "- Throw a bomb into one of the missile launchers to destroy it.",
    "- Take out both of its missile launchers to bring down the Flyfish.",
    "- The latest model of weapon from leading Salmonid engineers.",
    "- Only the most elite Smallfry are selected to undergo the special training to become Flyfish pilots.",
    "- Equipped with a space-grade reaction control system on each flank to enable a smooth, stable hover.",
    "- Flyfish are one of four Boss Salmonids that can attack players without having close proximity to them, the others being the Stinger, the Drizzler and the Big Shot.",
    "- If being targeted by missiles, players should stay away from the basket so crewmates can deliver eggs safely.\nPlayers should also stay away from crewmates using the Sting Ray.",
    "- Players need to coordinate which player will throw a bomb in which missile launcher. This can be done by observing which missile launcher the other player is closer to, and safely assuming that it is the one they will destroy.\nIn freelance where communication is limited, ideally, the teammates standing next to each other should take the respective launchers in front of them.",
    "- In higher hazard levels, it can be effective to only destroy one of the missile launchers to keep the Flyfish alive if many are spawning, as the boss spawn rate is higher and it takes a lot of resources to take down a Flyfish. This will prevent new Flyfish from spawning, as the game only allows up to three (or four under certain circumstances if the Hazard Level is at the maximum 333%) Boss Salmonids of the same kind to remain on stage at any given time.\nThe term coined for this technique is called \"weakening\".\nFlyfish can only fire 4 missiles with one basket.\nA weakened Flyfish can only target the closest player, so keeping control of where missiles are launched is a good thing to think about. (Explained in Trivia)\nPast the 28 second mark Flyfish should no longer be weakened as no more bosses will spawn in past that point.",
    "- It is possible for a player to destroy a Flyfish in one missile-launch cycle without the assistance of another player. Throw the bomb as soon as the hatch opens, then immediately recharge ink for the second bomb and throw it as soon as possible.",
    "- Aiming bombs at the missile launchers is not guesswork. While holding , a line appears on the screen showing exactly where the bomb will go. However, holding the button too long may lead to a missed opportunity as the missile launcher hatches will close back up, and at times it may bounce off the rim of the launcher.",
    "- Caution must be used when using Splashdown or Inkjet near a Flyfish, since both attacks bring the user high enough to come into physical contact with the Flyfish, which inflicts substantial damage on the user.",
    "- When battlefield conditions prevent the player from waiting for the ink tank to refill, or when there are multiple Flyfish, deploying either the Bomb Launcher or Inkjet is useful.",
    "- Take out Flyfish as soon as possible. If on a higher rank, chances are that there will be multiple Flyfish spawning.",
    "- If the player happens to fall into a Flyfish's bucket (most likely from a Slammin' Lid or Fish Stick) while in a lifesaver, they should stay there. Bombs can possibly fall out of Flyfish buckets, but they explode immediately if they touch a lifesaver (i.e. the player). This means that their position makes it easier for their teammates to deal with the Flyfish, as bombs will not bounce out of the bucket they are in.",
    "Splatting Flyfish a specific number of times in Salmon Run Next Wave will reward the player with special badges that they can use on their Splashtag.",

    "- A Flyfish before firing.",
    "- An above view of a Flyfish firing missiles.",
    "- Two players splatting a Flyfish without communication, each throwing a bomb into the closest basket to them.",

    "- The Flyfish locker decoration.",
    "- When introducing the different Boss Salmonids during the second training mission, Mr. Grizz refers to all of them as \"it\", except the Flyfish, which he calls \"him\", and Maws, which he calls \"she\". This makes them the only two Salmonids with a confirmed gender in the North American version.\nThis could possibly imply by extension that the Smallfry pilots are all male.",
    "- Flyfish's launchers resemble beverage coolers, while the missiles resemble soft drink bottles or ramune.\nIn the concept artwork, it appears to resemble two recycling bins with pull-tab cans.",
    "- In Splatoon 2, Flyfish are the only Boss Salmonids that do not visibly emerge from the water upon spawning, instead simply fading in. In Splatoon 3, this is no longer the case, and Flyfish properly rise out of the water. However, they will still fade out if they are alive at the end of a wave.",
    "- Flyfish are the only Boss Salmonid that cannot be killed with every main weapon.",
    "In addition to simply being a literal descriptor of the enemy (a fish that flies), Flyfish may be a reference to fly fishing, an angling method often used to catch fish like salmon, or to flying fish."
