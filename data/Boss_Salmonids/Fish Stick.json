    "Fish Sticks are Boss Salmonids that appear in Salmon Run Next Wave in Splatoon 3.",
    "A Fish Stick is a tall, tower-like pillar that is carried by a group of Smallfry wearing propeller hats greatly resembling those of Octocopters. The spout where an Octocopter would normally shoot ink now resembles a megaphone strapped over their mouths, which is likely used to increase the range of their voices.",
    "The flying Smallfry will fly inland, from where they spawn in the air by the shoreline, and will place the small tower on the ground via a drill on the bottom of the tower. After planting the pillar, the Smallfry fly in a circle and slowly rain down ink to cover the surrounding area. A Fish Stick can defeated by splatting all the Smallfry above it, either by using nearby high ground or by taking advantage of the blind spot directly around the pillar to ink it and climb up. Once all the Smallfry have been splatted, the Fish Stick will drop three Golden Eggs on the top of the pillar. If the Smallfry are splatted before they can plant their pillar, the pillar is destroyed; otherwise, it remains where it was placed until the end of the wave and can be used as high ground against other Salmonids.",
    "The following text is quoted from the Salmonid Field Guide.[2]",
    "Basic Information",
    "- It's a squad of flying Smallfry carrying a massive pillar.",
    "- They plant the pillar in the ground, then fly around above the pillar, spraying ink and generally being a nuisance.",
    "- After you splat them, the pillar will stick around.",
    "Attack Behavior",
    "- Several Smallfry fly in circles above the pillar, spraying ink.",
    "Elimination",
    "- Splat all orbiting Smallfry with ink shots.",
    "- Climb the pillar, and aim from the top to splat in relative safety.",
    "Supporting Information",
    "- They train to increase their lung capacity, and some are even recruited to become Stingers.",
    "- As they fly in circles, they sing a cheerful tune to encourage their fellow Salmonids in battle.",
    "- Although using the pillar as high ground can be useful, the player is vulnerable to many Boss Salmonids, such as Maws, Stingers, Drizzlers, and Flyfish.",
    "- The Fish Stick will only land at predetermined locations on any stage, so experienced players can plan ahead for exactly where one will spawn.",
    "- Fish Sticks that land at crucial locations, such as near the basket, should be dealt with quickly. The ink they spray has a wide range and can severely hinder players' movement, leaving them vulnerable to bosses such as Flyfish, Maws, Scrappers, and Steelheads.\nFish Sticks that land in less important locations can be ignored as long as the players can deal with other bosses effectively.",
    "- During Cohock Charge, they become a much higher priority due to their ability to block the sight lines of the cannons. Players manning the cannons should shoot them down as soon as they appear and before they land.",
    "Splatting Fish Sticks a specific number of times in Salmon Run will reward the player with special badges that they can use on their Splashtag.",
    "- The Salmonid Field Guide entry for the Fish Stick.",
    "- The illustration in the field guide.",
    "- The Fish Stick's design.",
    "- The Fish Stick, as shown in the first trailer for Salmon Run Next Wave.",
    "- A Fish Stick in-game.",
    "- An Inkling on top of a Fish Stick shooting at the Smallfry attached to the pillar.",
    "- An Octoling who has been Splatted by the Smallfry that make up the Fish Stick.",
    "- The Fish Stick's icon.",
    "- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Fish Stick.",
    "- Unofficial render of the Fish Stick's game model from Splatoon 3.",
    "- The Fish Stick locker decoration.",
    "Splatoon 3:",
    "- The chant heard when the player is near a Fish Stick somewhat resembles All the Thangs.",
    "- Near the top of the pillar, various cookware, like spatulas, can be seen hanging.",
    "Fish sticks are a food made using fish, fitting with the Salmonids' wish to look tasty and them seeing their death by being eaten as a way of being one with the world. It also refers to the pillar the Fish Stick use."
