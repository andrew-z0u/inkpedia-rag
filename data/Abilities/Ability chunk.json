They are used to add specific types of abilities to gear.\n\n- 1 Use\n\n- 2 Splatoon 2\n\n2.1 Obtaining chunks\n2.2 Adding abilities\n\n- 2.1 Obtaining chunks\n\n- 2.2 Adding abilities\n\n- 3 Splatoon 3\n\n- 4 Gallery\n\n4.1 Splatoon 2\n\n- 4.1 Splatoon 2\n\n- 5 Names in other languages\n\n- 2.1 Obtaining chunks\n\n- 2.2 Adding abilities\n\n- 4.1 Splatoon 2\n\nAbility chunks are a more reliable method for acquiring secondary gear abilities than rerolling gear or using probability-influencing drinks from the Crust Bucket. Due to this, they are often used for getting or stacking abilities that are unlikely to appear in a re-roll.\n\nIn Splatoon 3, applying ability chunks is the only way to replace the main ability of a gear item.\n\nAbility chunks can be obtained from green capsules that are rewarded in Salmon Run. Ordinary green capsules have a 40% chance to contain two ability chunks and a 10% to yield four, while shiny green capsules guarantee four chunks. Gear rewards can also be exchanged for the abilities present on the given gear, turning those secondary gear abilities into chunks.\n\nMurch has the option to scrub any gear the player has, where the secondary abilities are \"scrubbed\" off and turned into chunks that the player obtains with the cost of  20,000 cash (or  2,000 cash when scrubbing the Splatfest Tee). The player also gains chunks when rerolling gear, where the previous secondary abilities are turned into 1 chunk each.\n\nAs of Version 4.0.0, the player was able to earn ability chunks from the Splatfest Tee if all the slots were already filled out, as the shirt continued filling in experience points, which awarded a random ability chunk every 7500 points. This only occurred during the Splatfest and not in the period of time following its announcement.\n\nIn Splatoon 2, ability chunks can only be used to add or overwrite secondary gear abilities.\n\nThe price of one secondary ability depends on the number of the same secondary ability already present on the gear item, ignoring its gear brand, star count, and primary ability. The amounts are:\n\n- 10 chunks for the first copy;\n\n- 20 chunks for the second copy; and\n\n- 30 chunks for the third copy.\n\nFor example, a gear with three secondary ability slots has one Run Speed Up and one Swim Speed Up as its secondary abilities.\n\n- 20 Run Speed Up chunks are needed to apply Run Speed Up to the empty third secondary slot since one sub of Run Speed Up is already present on the gear.\n\n- 10 Special Saver chunks are needed to apply Special Saver to the empty third secondary slot since no sub of Special Saver is already present on the gear.\n\n- 20 Swim Speed Up chunks are needed to replace Run Speed Up on the first secondary slot with Swim Speed Up since one sub of Swim Speed Up is already present on the gear.\n\nOverwriting a secondary gear ability with ability chunks grants 1 chunk of the old ability.\n\nIn addition to adding secondary abilities with chunks (with the same rules as the previous game), Splatoon 3 introduces the ability to replace the primary ability of a gear item with ability chunks, once again done via Murch. It requires 45 ability chunks of the desired primary ability and after replacement 6 chunks of the old ability are refunded. The cost is unaffected by the item's gear brand, star power, or secondary abilities.\n\nFor primary slot-only abilities, their installation requires 15 chunks of three specific abilities (for a total of 45 chunks) and when overwritten they refund 2 chunks of said component abilities (for a total of 6 chunks). The primary slot-only abilities that can be applied with chunks and their component chunks are listed below.\n\nFor the Splatfest Tee, the primary ability installation only requires 6 chunks (for non-exclusive abilities) or 2 chunks of three component abilities (for primary slot-only abilities; with a total of 6 chunks). The amount of refunded chunks is the same as any other gear item.\n\nAbility Doubler is exclusive to the Splatfest Tee, cannot be applied with ability chunks, and when overwritten will not refund any chunks.\n\nAlongside the same methods as in Splatoon 2, ability chunks can also be obtained by continuing to obtain experience on a gear item after its secondary slots are filled (even if it has less than three secondary slots), giving a chunk of a randomly rolled ability, and as rewards from the Shell-Out Machine.\n\n- Murch scrubbing a pair of Yellow-Mesh Sneakers.\n\n- An official image advertising Murch's ability scrubbing service.\n\n- Gear Ability Tips thumbnail from the Nintendo Switch News menu."
