  "content": "Quick Respawn is an ability in the Splatoon series.\n\nThis ability shortens the player's respawn time after getting splatted. In Splatoon 2, it triggers only if certain conditions are met.\n\nWithout this ability, watching the splat cam takes ~6 seconds (after a ~0.5 second splatting animation), followed by a ~2 second respawn animation (total time of ~8.5 seconds). This ability only reduces the splat cam portion of the respawn process. Without this ability, the total respawn times for drowning in water and for falling out-of-bounds are ~7 seconds and ~5.5 seconds respectively.\n\n- 1 Tactics\n\n- 2 Splatoon\n\n2.1 Gear\n2.2 Stacking\n2.3 Gallery\n\n- 2.1 Gear\n\n- 2.2 Stacking\n\n- 2.3 Gallery\n\n- 3 Splatoon 2\n\n3.1 Mechanics\n3.2 Gear\n3.3 Stacking\n3.4 Version history\n\n- 3.1 Mechanics\n\n- 3.2 Gear\n\n- 3.3 Stacking\n\n- 3.4 Version history\n\n- 4 Splatoon 3\n\n4.1 Gear\n\n- 4.1 Gear\n\n- 5 Names in other languages\n\n- 2.1 Gear\n\n- 2.2 Stacking\n\n- 2.3 Gallery\n\n- 3.1 Mechanics\n\n- 3.2 Gear\n\n- 3.3 Stacking\n\n- 3.4 Version history\n\n- 4.1 Gear\n\nQuick Respawn tends to be most useful in Ranked Battles. This is due to the importance of getting back to the front lines quickly and the high likelihood of being splatted, since both teams are often gathered in a single area, such as around the Rainmaker or a Splat Zone. Teamwork is a crucial element of Ranked Battles, as well; being able to rejoin one's team just a moment sooner may turn the tide of battle. Stealth Jump paired with this ability can further help the user quickly get back into action after they get splatted.\n\nAfter getting splatted, Quick Respawn decreases the time spent watching the splat cam or black screen.\n\nRespawn time after being splatted by falling out-of-bounds or drowning in water is shorter than after being splatted by another player.\n\nThe number of ability points for Quick Respawn can be temporarily increased by Last-Ditch Effort.\n\nQuick Respawn is the main ability of:\n\n- Graph showing the effects of stacking Quick Respawn.\n\n- How Quick Respawn and Quick Super Jump interact.\n\nThe effectiveness of Quick Respawn can be temporarily decreased by Respawn Punisher used by any player.\n\nFor Quick Respawn to activate, the player must not splat an enemy during the time between their most recent enemy-caused death and their current death. This is different from Splatoon, where Quick Respawn always activated, with no eligibility requirements whatsoever.\n\nA finite-state machine follows below. It determines when a player is eligible for Quick Respawn, and when Quick Respawn activates.\n\nClarification:\n\n- In a traded scenario, the activation of Quick Respawn depends on who died first. For example, if the player throws a bomb that splats an opponent after the player dies, that splat prevents Quick Respawn from activating in next death, but allows it to activate for the current death.\n\n- Assists do not count as splats. A splat confirmation notification will show on the player's screen if they score a splat.\n\n- There can be any number of deaths between the most recent enemy-caused death and the current death. For example, a player dies once to an enemy, then five times to water, and then to an enemy. As long as the player in the example did not score any splats during the time between the first and second death to the enemy, Quick Respawn will activate.\n\n- These death types do not count as enemy-caused: drowning in water, falling out of bounds, touching the Rainmaker barrier, having the Rainmaker time out and explode while carrying it.\n\n- The need for a previous death means that the first death in a match will never benefit from Quick Respawn. Every following death can potentially benefit.\n\nQuick Respawn is the main ability of:\n\n- A chart showing the effect of Quick Respawn.\n\n- ▼ Quick Respawn no longer applies if user falls out-of-bounds or drowns in water.\n\n- ▼ User must not splat an opponent during the time between their most recent enemy-caused death and their current death for Quick Respawn to affect the current death.\n\nQuick Respawn is the main ability of:"
