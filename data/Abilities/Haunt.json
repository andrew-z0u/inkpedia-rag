    "Haunt is a gear primary ability in the Splatoon series.",
    "Haunt helps the user track the opponent that splatted them. In Splatoon, Haunt also gives the user Damage Up, Defense Up, and Run Speed Up while certain conditions are met. In Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3, when the user splats an opponent they are currently tracking, that opponent suffers the effects of Respawn Punisher for that splat.",
    "The opponent who splats the user will be marked by a circling black squid for about 9 seconds by default or about 4.5 seconds with Cold-Blooded.",
    "While the user is marked by an opposing Point Sensor, Echolocator, or by splatting another Haunt user, 20 AP[1] of Damage Up and Defense Up and an unknown amount of Run Speed Up is given to the user.",
    "Haunt is useful for players who usually flank; and for back liners, since if they are splatted, their team is more likely to notice that an enemy may be coming up from behind.",
    "Haunt is the primary ability of:",
    "Haunt now tracks opponents who splatted the user with white silhouettes (like Thermal Ink and Sting Ray) that can be seen through opaque objects only to the user while at least a certain distance from the opponent (Bomb Defense Up DX increases this minimum distance) and while the opponent is not submerged in ink. Unlike the Thermal Ink, the Haunt effect lasts until the opponent is splatted.",
    "If the Haunt user splats an opponent who they are currently tracking, the victim gets the effects of Respawn Punisher for that splat and the user's Haunt icon will be highlighted by a yellow ring on the victim's splat cam. The Respawn Punisher penalty does not apply if the tracked opponent gets splatted by any other means, but the tracking silhouette still disappears.",
    "There is no limit on how many opponents a Haunt user can track. So even if all four opponents on the enemy team splat the Haunt user, the Haunt user will be tracking four players.",
    "Additionally, Murch or Spyke can replace the primary ability on a piece of clothing with Haunt by using 15 of each of the following ability chunks:",
    "- Quick Respawn",
    "- Sub Power Up",
    "- Ink Resistance Up",
    "- Point Sensor",
    "- Thermal Ink"
