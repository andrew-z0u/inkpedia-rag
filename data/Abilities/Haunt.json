  "content": "Haunt is a gear primary ability in the Splatoon series.\n\nHaunt helps the user track the opponent that splatted them. In Splatoon, Haunt also gives the user Damage Up, Defense Up, and Run Speed Up while certain conditions are met. In Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3, when the user splats an opponent they are currently tracking, that opponent suffers the effects of Respawn Punisher for that splat.\n\n- 1 Splatoon\n\n1.1 Mechanics\n1.2 Tactics\n1.3 Gear\n1.4 Version history\n1.5 Gallery\n\n- 1.1 Mechanics\n\n- 1.2 Tactics\n\n- 1.3 Gear\n\n- 1.4 Version history\n\n- 1.5 Gallery\n\n- 2 Splatoon 2\n\n2.1 Mechanics\n2.2 Gear\n2.3 Version history\n\n- 2.1 Mechanics\n\n- 2.2 Gear\n\n- 2.3 Version history\n\n- 3 Splatoon 3\n\n3.1 Gear\n\n- 3.1 Gear\n\n- 4 Names in other languages\n\n- 5 See also\n\n- 6 References\n\n- 1.1 Mechanics\n\n- 1.2 Tactics\n\n- 1.3 Gear\n\n- 1.4 Version history\n\n- 1.5 Gallery\n\n- 2.1 Mechanics\n\n- 2.2 Gear\n\n- 2.3 Version history\n\n- 3.1 Gear\n\nThe opponent who splats the user will be marked by a circling black squid for about 9 seconds by default or about 4.5 seconds with Cold-Blooded.\n\nWhile the user is marked by an opposing Point Sensor, Echolocator, or by splatting another Haunt user, 20 AP[1] of Damage Up and Defense Up and an unknown amount of Run Speed Up is given to the user.\n\nHaunt is useful for players who usually flank; and for back liners, since if they are splatted, their team is more likely to notice that an enemy may be coming up from behind.\n\nHaunt is the primary ability of:\n\n- ▲ Haunt will now also increase attack power, defense, and Inkling movement speed while being marked by the enemy.\n\n- ▼ Duration reduced: 12s → 9s\n\nHaunt now tracks opponents who splatted the user with white silhouettes (like Thermal Ink and Sting Ray) that can be seen through opaque objects only to the user while at least a certain distance from the opponent (Bomb Defense Up DX increases this minimum distance) and while the opponent is not submerged in ink. Unlike the Thermal Ink, the Haunt effect lasts until the opponent is splatted.\n\nIf the Haunt user splats an opponent who they are currently tracking, the victim gets the effects of Respawn Punisher for that splat and the user's Haunt icon will be highlighted by a yellow ring on the victim's splat cam. The Respawn Punisher penalty does not apply if the tracked opponent gets splatted by any other means, but the tracking silhouette still disappears.\n\nThere is no limit on how many opponents a Haunt user can track. So even if all four opponents on the enemy team splat the Haunt user, the Haunt user will be tracking four players.\n\nHaunt is the primary ability of:\n\n- — Haunt now applies a white silhouette on the opponent who splatted the user instead of marking them with a circling black squid.\n▲ Haunt no longer signals the splatter when it gets activated.\n▼ The silhouette can only be seen by the Haunt user who gets splatted by the tracked opponent.\n▼ The silhouette is only visible if the tracked opponent is at least a certain distance from the Haunt user and not submerged in ink.\n▼ Removed the line connecting the user to the tracked opponent.\n\n- ▲ Haunt no longer signals the splatter when it gets activated.\n\n- ▼ The silhouette can only be seen by the Haunt user who gets splatted by the tracked opponent.\n\n- ▼ The silhouette is only visible if the tracked opponent is at least a certain distance from the Haunt user and not submerged in ink.\n\n- ▼ Removed the line connecting the user to the tracked opponent.\n\n- ▲ Base duration increased to 30 seconds.\n\n- ▼ No longer gives abilities when the user is marked by a Point Sensor or another Haunt user.\n\n- ▲ Haunt no longer signals the splatter when it gets activated.\n\n- ▼ The silhouette can only be seen by the Haunt user who gets splatted by the tracked opponent.\n\n- ▼ The silhouette is only visible if the tracked opponent is at least a certain distance from the Haunt user and not submerged in ink.\n\n- ▼ Removed the line connecting the user to the tracked opponent.\n\n- ▲ Opponents behind stage objects will be revealed when the Haunt's effective range is roughly 23% further away from them than it was previously.\n\n- ▲ Opposing players marked with Haunt will now incur the penalties of Respawn Punisher when splatted by the player that they splatted.\n\n- — When an opponent splats the player, that activation will stand out clearly on the screen while waiting to respawn.\n\n- ▲ The duration has been increased from 30 seconds to infinite.\nIf the target afflicted with Haunt is splatted, the effect will disappear as normal.\n\n- If the target afflicted with Haunt is splatted, the effect will disappear as normal.\n\n- ▲ Number of targets that can be afflicted with Haunt at once increased to four.\nThis means that if a second, third, or fourth player were to splat someone who has Haunt equipped, the previous players afflicted with Haunt's effects will continue to be affected.\n\n- This means that if a second, third, or fourth player were to splat someone who has Haunt equipped, the previous players afflicted with Haunt's effects will continue to be affected.\n\n- If the target afflicted with Haunt is splatted, the effect will disappear as normal.\n\n- This means that if a second, third, or fourth player were to splat someone who has Haunt equipped, the previous players afflicted with Haunt's effects will continue to be affected.\n\nHaunt is the primary ability of:\n\nAdditionally, Murch or Spyke can replace the primary ability on a piece of clothing with Haunt by using 15 of each of the following ability chunks:\n\n- Quick Respawn\n\n- Sub Power Up\n\n- Ink Resistance Up\n\n- Point Sensor\n\n- Thermal Ink"
