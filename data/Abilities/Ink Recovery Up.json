Depending on the cause of the ink consumption, Ink Saver (Main) or Ink Saver (Sub) may also be good candidates; Ink Recovery Up in use with Ink Savers serves a similar purpose, allowing the player to spend more time using weapons by either prolonging the tank or refilling it quicker. The increased ink recovery from this ability means that less time is needed in squid or octopus form to refill, making it particularly useful in Turf Wars where covering lots of turf with ink is needed. Ink Recovery Up is generally recommended for heavy ink weapons such as chargers and splatlings, which use a lot of ink before refilling.\n\nIn this game, the Ink Recovery Up improves the user's ink tank refill rate only while submerged in ink.\n\nInk Recovery Up is the main ability of:\n\nTime required to recover ink:\n\n[1]\n\n- A graph showing the effects of stacking Ink Recovery Up.\n\n- ▲ Increased the maximum possible ink recovery rate: 67% → 82%\n\nIn this game, the Ink Recovery Up also improves the user's ink tank refill rate when not submerged in ink (note that ink recovery only occurs after the player stops firing their weapon for several frames) in addition to when submerged in ink.\n\nInk Recovery Up is the main ability of:\n\nTime required to recover ink:\n\n[2]\n\n- A graph showing the effects of stacking Ink Recovery Up.\n\n- ▲ Ink Recovery Up also increases ink recovery when not submerged in ink.\n\n- ▼ Reduced effect when submerged in ink by roughly 15%.\n\n- ▲ Increased effect when in kid form by roughly 6%.\n\nInk Recovery Up improves the user's ink tank refill rate, both when when submerged in ink and not submerged in ink.\n\nInk Recovery Up is the main ability of:\n\nTime required to recover ink, 100% corresponds to 3 seconds:[3]"
