    "Respawn Punisher is a gear primary ability in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3. The ability is exclusive to clothing, and cannot be rolled as a secondary gear ability.",
    "Respawn Punisher increases the respawn time and the amount of Special Gauge that is lost to both the user and opponents defeated by the user. The effects of Quick Respawn are reduced by 85% if the person with Quick Respawn is defeated by a Respawn Punisher user.",
    "This ability is found as the main ability only on clothing, so other abilities found only on clothing are mutually exclusive with it; in other words, players cannot have them together. These abilities are Ability Doubler, Haunt, Ninja Squid, and Thermal Ink. In addition, since wearing the Splatfest Tee with Ability Doubler is mandatory during a Splatfest, these abilities cannot be used for the duration of those events (with the exception of Splatoon 3 Splatfests allowing you to change your main ability for the Tee).",

    "- Without Respawn Punisher, a player executing a Splashdown but gets splatted before landing with it only gets 25% remaining special gauge penalty. Respawn Punisher increases this penalty as shown on the table above.",
    "- Respawn Punisher has no effect on assists. The user must land the final blow that splats the enemy for there to be an effect.",
    "- If the user drowns or falls out-of-bounds, Respawn Punisher does not affect respawn time, but still increases special gauge penalty.",
    "- The strength of Respawn Punisher is unaffected by the number of the user's deaths or splats.",
    "- Haunt can also induce Respawn Punisher penalty, but only if the Haunt user is the one who gets the splat and is tracking the victim at the time of the splat.",
