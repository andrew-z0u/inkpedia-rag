The ability is exclusive to clothing, and cannot be rolled as a secondary gear ability.\n\nRespawn Punisher increases the respawn time and the amount of Special Gauge that is lost to both the user and opponents defeated by the user. The effects of Quick Respawn are reduced by 85% if the person with Quick Respawn is defeated by a Respawn Punisher user.\n\n- 1 Mutual exclusivity\n\n- 2 Splatoon 2\n\n2.1 Gear\n2.2 Data\n2.3 Version history\n\n- 2.1 Gear\n\n- 2.2 Data\n\n- 2.3 Version history\n\n- 3 Splatoon 3\n\n3.1 Gear\n\n- 3.1 Gear\n\n- 4 Names in other languages\n\n- 5 Notes\n\n- 6 References\n\n- 2.1 Gear\n\n- 2.2 Data\n\n- 2.3 Version history\n\n- 3.1 Gear\n\nThis ability is found as the main ability only on clothing, so other abilities found only on clothing are mutually exclusive with it; in other words, players cannot have them together. These abilities are Ability Doubler, Haunt, Ninja Squid, and Thermal Ink. In addition, since wearing the Splatfest Tee with Ability Doubler is mandatory during a Splatfest, these abilities cannot be used for the duration of those events (with the exception of Splatoon 3 Splatfests allowing you to change your main ability for the Tee).\n\nRespawn Punisher is the primary ability of:\n\n- When a player gets splatted by a Respawn Punisher user, the splatter's Respawn Punisher icon on the splat cam is highlighted by a yellow ring.\n\n- Respawn Punisher has a stronger effect on the user than on the enemy, as shown in the table above. The penalties will also stack if the user is splatted by another user of the ability.\n\n- Respawn Punisher reduces the effect of the opponent's Quick Respawn by 85%.\n\n- Without Respawn Punisher, a player executing a Splashdown but gets splatted before landing with it only gets 25% remaining special gauge penalty. Respawn Punisher increases this penalty as shown on the table above.\n\n- Respawn Punisher has no effect on assists. The user must land the final blow that splats the enemy for there to be an effect.\n\n- If the user drowns or falls out-of-bounds, Respawn Punisher does not affect respawn time, but still increases special gauge penalty.\n\n- The strength of Respawn Punisher is unaffected by the number of the user's deaths or splats.\n\n- Haunt can also induce Respawn Punisher penalty, but only if the Haunt user is the one who gets the splat and is tracking the victim at the time of the splat.\n\n[1]\n[2]\n\n- A chart showing the effect of Respawn Punisher and Special Saver.\n\n- ▲ Increased the reduction of a defeated opponent's special gauge when they respawn from 5% to 15%.\n\n- ▼ Increased the reduction of the user's special gauge when respawning from 7.5% to 22.5%.\n\n- ▲ Increased degree to which the effect of the gear ability Quick Respawn is nullified on opponents from 80% to 85%.\n\n- ▲ Teammates caught in the Rainmaker explosion after the timer reaches zero will no longer get penalized.\n\n- — When an opponent who splats the player, that activation will stand out clearly on the screen while waiting to respawn.\n\n- — Fixed an issue causing Respawn Punisher to not take effect when defeated by an enemy with that gear ability while the player also had Respawn Punisher equipped.\n\nAs of Version 2.1.0 Respawn Punisher no longer prevents the immediate respawn boost and special gauge loss from Tacticooler.\n\nRespawn Punisher is the primary ability of:\n\nAdditionally, Murch or Spyke can replace the primary ability on a piece of clothing with Respawn Punisher by using 15 of each of the following ability chunks:\n\n- Special Saver\n\n- Quick Respawn\n\n- Sub Resistance Up"
