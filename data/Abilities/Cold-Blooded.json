    "Cold-Blooded is an ability in Splatoon, and a retired ability in Splatoon 2.",
    "Cold-Blooded shortens the duration of position-tracking effects inflicted on the wearer.",
    "Cold Blooded shortens the duration of position tracking by 50% of the normal tracking time.",
    "Times are in seconds and are approximate.\n*Can change because of Special Duration Up",
    "- In-game description of Cold-Blooded",
    "In Splatoon 2, Cold-Blooded is a stackable ability that was available on any gear type. It could shorten the tracking effects of Point Sensors, Ink Mines, Thermal Ink, Haunt, and the Sting Ray.",
    "In version 4.3.0, Cold-Blooded was retired, and its effects were combined with Bomb Defense Up to make a new ability: Bomb Defense Up DX. The default ability of all gear with Cold-Blooded (except the Gray FA-11 Bomber, Pearlescent Crown, and Fringed Loafers, which are not available in SplatNet 2 to have alternate main abilities) was changed to Main Power Up, while existing gear with the Cold-Blooded ability was overwritten with Bomb Defense Up DX.",
    "- A graph showing the effect of Cold-Blooded on Point Sensors and Ink Mines.",
    "- A graph showing the effect of Cold-Blooded on Thermal Ink.",
    "Cold-Blooded is rather versatile, as any weapon or play style can benefit from not being tracked. However, it reaches its full potential when used with a stealthy and mobile weapon, such as the Carbon Roller or Octobrush as it can enhance the sneakiness of a weapon, facilitating ambushes. A loud or otherwise conspicuous weapon may give itself away to surrounding enemies with no tracking needed.",
    "- In Splatoon 2, Cold-Blooded was the only ability that was favored by two brands.\nAdditionally, after being retired in version 4.3.0, Main Power Up replaced Cold-Blooded as well as its favored brands.",
    "- In real life, all squids are ectothermic, or \"cold-blooded\", which the Cold-Blooded ability could be a reference to."
