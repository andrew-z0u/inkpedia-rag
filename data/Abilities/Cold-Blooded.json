It could shorten the tracking effects of Point Sensors, Ink Mines, Thermal Ink, Haunt, and the Sting Ray.\n\nIn version 4.3.0, Cold-Blooded was retired, and its effects were combined with Bomb Defense Up to make a new ability: Bomb Defense Up DX. The default ability of all gear with Cold-Blooded (except the Gray FA-11 Bomber, Pearlescent Crown, and Fringed Loafers, which are not available in SplatNet 2 to have alternate main abilities) was changed to Main Power Up, while existing gear with the Cold-Blooded ability was overwritten with Bomb Defense Up DX.\n\n- A graph showing the effect of Cold-Blooded on Point Sensors and Ink Mines.\n\n- A graph showing the effect of Cold-Blooded on Thermal Ink.\n\n- ▲ Tracking time reduction increased by 50%: up to 50% → up to 75%\n\n- ▲ Tracking time reduction increased by 20%: up to 75% → up to 90%\n\n- ▲ Cold-Blooded now also increases the area in which the player is immune to the revealing effects of Thermal Ink, Haunt, and the Sting Ray.\n\n- — Removed. Effects integrated with Bomb Defense Up into Bomb Defense Up DX.\n\n- ▲ Preexisting mains changed to Bomb Defense Up DX.\n— Items originally with Cold-Blooded as a main can be repurchased with Main Power Up (aside from gear unobtainable from SplatNet 2, which have Bomb Defense Up DX).\n\n- — Items originally with Cold-Blooded as a main can be repurchased with Main Power Up (aside from gear unobtainable from SplatNet 2, which have Bomb Defense Up DX).\n\n- ▲ Preexisting subs, ability chunks, and drink tickets changed to Bomb Defense Up DX.\n\n- — Items originally with Cold-Blooded as a main can be repurchased with Main Power Up (aside from gear unobtainable from SplatNet 2, which have Bomb Defense Up DX).\n\nCold-Blooded is rather versatile, as any weapon or play style can benefit from not being tracked. However, it reaches its full potential when used with a stealthy and mobile weapon, such as the Carbon Roller or Octobrush as it can enhance the sneakiness of a weapon, facilitating ambushes. A loud or otherwise conspicuous weapon may give itself away to surrounding enemies with no tracking needed.\n\n- In Splatoon 2, Cold-Blooded was the only ability that was favored by two brands.\nAdditionally, after being retired in version 4.3.0, Main Power Up replaced Cold-Blooded as well as its favored brands.\n\n- Additionally, after being retired in version 4.3.0, Main Power Up replaced Cold-Blooded as well as its favored brands.\n\n- In real life, all squids are ectothermic, or \"cold-blooded\", which the Cold-Blooded ability could be a reference to.\n\n- Additionally, after being retired in version 4.3.0, Main Power Up replaced Cold-Blooded as well as its favored brands."
