  "content": "Bomb Defense Up was an ability in Splatoon 2. Inkline gear had a 5× chance of rolling this ability, while Krak-On gear had a 1/2× chance.\n\nBomb Defense Up reduced the damage taken from enemy sub weapons. Autobombs, Curling Bombs, Ink Mines, Splat Bombs, and Suction Bombs had their damage reduced by up to 50%. Burst Bombs had their damage reduced by up to 40%.\n\nBomb Defense Up reduced the damage taken from special weapons by up to 35%. Bomb Defense Up was known to affect the Baller, Inkjet, Splashdown, and Tenta Missiles.\n\nThe ability offered players a means of increasing survivability. For example, just one sub slot of the ability prevented the player from being splatted by two near-miss Inkjet shots. The damage reductions are never enough to prevent a one-hit splat.\n\nBomb Defense Up was retired in version 4.3.0. Players can still get the effect of Bomb Defense Up with Bomb Defense Up DX. The default ability of all gear with Bomb Defense Up became Bomb Defense Up DX.\n\nThe number of hits a weapon needed to splat the player with every threshold for Bomb Defense Up is shown in the following table. Amounts of Bomb Defense Up that did not cause a change are not shown in the table.\n\nOther notable thresholds:\n\n- Main: 0, Sub: 3 — Survived one direct Burst Bomb plus two distant blasts.\n\n- Main: 0, Sub: 4 — Ink Armor survived a Burst Bomb near blast.\n\n- Main: 1, Sub: 4 — Survived a direct Burst Bomb plus two near blasts.\n\nPercent change for Burst Bombs:\n\nPercent change for other bombs:\n\nPercent change for special weapons:\n\n- A chart showing the effect of Bomb Defense Up.\n\n- — Removed. Effects integrated with Cold-Blooded into Bomb Defense Up DX.\n\n- ▲ Preexisting mains changed to Bomb Defense Up DX.\nAll gear that had Bomb Defense Up as its default main ability now has Bomb Defense Up DX as its default main ability.\n\n- All gear that had Bomb Defense Up as its default main ability now has Bomb Defense Up DX as its default main ability.\n\n- ▲ Preexisting subs, ability chunks, and drink tickets changed to Bomb Defense Up DX.\n\n- All gear that had Bomb Defense Up as its default main ability now has Bomb Defense Up DX as its default main ability."
