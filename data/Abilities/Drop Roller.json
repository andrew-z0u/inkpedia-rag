    "Drop Roller is a gear primary ability in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3. The ability is exclusive to shoes and cannot be rolled as a secondary gear ability.",
    "Drop Roller allows the player to roll immediately after performing a Super Jump or returning to an Inkjet or Zipcaster's starting point by tilting  in the desired direction before landing. The roll is similar to the one provided by the dualie-type weapons, albeit much further and without any immobility after the roll. After a drop roll, the user will get 30 AP of Run Speed Up, Swim Speed Up, and Ink Resistance Up for about three seconds.",
    "This ability is useful for surviving a Super Jump or a return from an Inkjet or Zipcaster from a dangerous location. When a player Super Jumps or uses an Inkjet or Zipcaster, a marker is normally visible to show their landing location. As a result, opponents are liable to attempt to splat the player as soon as they land. Drop Roller allows the player to dodge enemy fire and possibly return fire to punish the opponent. Drop Roller is particularly useful for Inkjet and Zipcaster users, as their return points cannot be hidden with Stealth Jump and so are always visible to opponents.",

    "Additionally, Murch or Spyke can replace the primary ability on a pair of shoes with Drop Roller by using 15 of each of the following ability chunks:",
    "- Quick Super Jump",
    "- Ink Resistance Up",
    "- Intensify Action",
    "- A player using Drop Roller",
    "- In Splatoon 3, when landing after use of the Inkjet or Zipcaster, the player can still perform a dodge roll using this ability even if the match has ended (between the display of \"Game!\" and the following fade-out)."
