  "content": "Ink Resistance Up is an ability in the Splatoon series. It mitigates the negative effects of touching the opponent's ink on the ground. Negative effects alleviated by Ink Resistance Up include reduced jump height, reduced movement speed, and accumulation of damage. The ability stays active throughout the entire match and is used any time the player steps on enemy ink.\n\n- 1 Splatoon\n\n1.1 Tactics\n1.2 Gear\n1.3 Version history\n1.4 Gallery\n\n- 1.1 Tactics\n\n- 1.2 Gear\n\n- 1.3 Version history\n\n- 1.4 Gallery\n\n- 2 Splatoon 2\n\n2.1 Tactics\n2.2 Gear\n2.3 Stacking\n2.4 Version history\n\n- 2.1 Tactics\n\n- 2.2 Gear\n\n- 2.3 Stacking\n\n- 2.4 Version history\n\n- 3 Splatoon 3\n\n3.1 Gear\n\n- 3.1 Gear\n\n- 4 Names in other languages\n\n- 5 References\n\n- 1.1 Tactics\n\n- 1.2 Gear\n\n- 1.3 Version history\n\n- 1.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.1 Tactics\n\n- 2.2 Gear\n\n- 2.3 Stacking\n\n- 2.4 Version history\n\n- 3.1 Gear\n\nInk Resistance Up improves the mobility of Inklings stepping or swimming in enemy ink. It also reduces the damage taken from stepping in or swimming through enemy ink. Normally, touching enemy ink accumulates up to 50 damage at a rate of 30 damage per second. But with Ink Resistance Up, only 30 damage can accumulate at a rate of 12 damage per second.\n\nPlayers do not appear on the opponents' mini-map until they have more than 30 damage. Since only 30 passive ink damage can accumulate by touching the opponent's ink with the ability, the user will not appear on the opponents' mini-map solely due to touching the opponent's ink.\n\nInk Resistance Up is the main ability of:\n\n- ▼ Ink Resistance Up was nerfed, making the ease of movement in enemy ink much less noticeable than before.\n\nInk Resistance Up prevents players from taking damage from opponent's ink for a certain duration (39 frames at maximum) after touching it.\n\nInk Resistance Up reduces the maximum damage that accumulates from stepping in enemy ink, from 40 damage to as low as 20 damage. The rate of damage accumulation is also reduced so that the damage cap is always reached in about 2.2 seconds after the user starts receiving damage.[1]\n\nInk Resistance Up increases the movement speed of a player in the opponent's ink while walking, but not while swimming. (The mobility benefits also apply while attacking with a weapon, while rolling with a roller, and while charging a splatling or charger.)\n\nThe effects of Ink Resistance Up do not activate when standing on an enemy sponge.\n\nQuicker movement in enemy ink is especially helpful for the Inkbrush and Octobrush, to move quickly even when turning sharply. Weapons that let the player strafe fast like the Sloshing Machine and Mini Splatling also benefit from Ink Resistance Up, as small patches of enemy ink will not slow down movement as much.\n\nInk Resistance Up is the main ability of:\n\n- A graph showing the effect of Ink Resistance Up on run speed.\n\n- A graph showing the effect of Ink Resistance Up on the amount of time before the player begins to accumulate damage.\n\n- A graph showing the effect of Ink Resistance Up on the maximum amount of damage the player can accumulate from enemy ink.\n\n- A graph showing the effect of Ink Resistance Up on the rate that enemy ink damages the player.\n\n- A graph showing the effect of Ink Resistance Up on jump height in enemy ink.\n\n- — Fixed an issue where, under the following conditions, players would only receive the benefit of Ink Resistance Up when stacking it to maximum effect.\nMoving while shooting a weapon in the Shooter category.\nMoving while shooting a weapon in the Dualies category.\nMoving while preparing to throw a bomb or special weapon.\n\n- Moving while shooting a weapon in the Shooter category.\n\n- Moving while shooting a weapon in the Dualies category.\n\n- Moving while preparing to throw a bomb or special weapon.\n\n- Moving while shooting a weapon in the Shooter category.\n\n- Moving while shooting a weapon in the Dualies category.\n\n- Moving while preparing to throw a bomb or special weapon.\n\n- ▲ Improved effect of reducing maximum amount of damage dealt by stepping in opponent's ink.\n\n- ▲ Speed at which damage is dealt when stepping in opponent's ink will now be slower.\n\n- ▲ When using this gear ability, players will avoid taking damage for a brief time after first stepping into an opponent's ink.\nThe length of time before taking damage in this way will be increased in proportion to the number of Ink Resistance Up abilities being used.\n\n- The length of time before taking damage in this way will be increased in proportion to the number of Ink Resistance Up abilities being used.\n\n- The length of time before taking damage in this way will be increased in proportion to the number of Ink Resistance Up abilities being used.\n\n- ▲ The time between stepping on enemy ink and starting to receive damage has been increased.\nAt maximum gear power, it is now 9/60 of a second longer than before.\n\n- At maximum gear power, it is now 9/60 of a second longer than before.\n\n- At maximum gear power, it is now 9/60 of a second longer than before.\n\n- ▲ Improved the gear ability's benefit of maintaining your ability to jump while stepping in enemy ink.\n\n- ▲ Improved the gear ability's benefit of maintaining movement speed while walking through enemy ink.\n\nIn Splatoon 3, Ink Resistance Up functions the same way as it did in the previous game. It is also available as an upgrade for the Hero Gear in Return of the Mammalians, and can be upgraded twice.\n\nInk Resistance Up is the main ability of:"
