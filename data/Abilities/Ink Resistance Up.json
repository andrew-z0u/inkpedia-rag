    "Ink Resistance Up is an ability in the Splatoon series. It mitigates the negative effects of touching the opponent's ink on the ground. Negative effects alleviated by Ink Resistance Up include reduced jump height, reduced movement speed, and accumulation of damage. The ability stays active throughout the entire match and is used any time the player steps on enemy ink.",
    "Ink Resistance Up improves the mobility of Inklings stepping or swimming in enemy ink. It also reduces the damage taken from stepping in or swimming through enemy ink. Normally, touching enemy ink accumulates up to 50 damage at a rate of 30 damage per second. But with Ink Resistance Up, only 30 damage can accumulate at a rate of 12 damage per second.",
    "Players do not appear on the opponents' mini-map until they have more than 30 damage. Since only 30 passive ink damage can accumulate by touching the opponent's ink with the ability, the user will not appear on the opponents' mini-map solely due to touching the opponent's ink.",

    "Ink Resistance Up prevents players from taking damage from opponent's ink for a certain duration (39 frames at maximum) after touching it.",
    "Ink Resistance Up reduces the maximum damage that accumulates from stepping in enemy ink, from 40 damage to as low as 20 damage. The rate of damage accumulation is also reduced so that the damage cap is always reached in about 2.2 seconds after the user starts receiving damage.[1]",
    "Ink Resistance Up increases the movement speed of a player in the opponent's ink while walking, but not while swimming. (The mobility benefits also apply while attacking with a weapon, while rolling with a roller, and while charging a splatling or charger.)",
    "The effects of Ink Resistance Up do not activate when standing on an enemy sponge.",
    "Quicker movement in enemy ink is especially helpful for the Inkbrush and Octobrush, to move quickly even when turning sharply. Weapons that let the player strafe fast like the Sloshing Machine and Mini Splatling also benefit from Ink Resistance Up, as small patches of enemy ink will not slow down movement as much.",
    "Ink Resistance Up is the main ability of:",
    "In Splatoon 3, Ink Resistance Up functions the same way as it did in the previous game. It is also available as an upgrade for the Hero Gear in Return of the Mammalians, and can be upgraded twice.",
