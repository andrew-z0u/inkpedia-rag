  "content": "Bomb Defense Up DX is an ability in Splatoon 2. It was added to the game on 5 December 2018 as part of version 4.3.0.\n\nBomb Defense Up DX reduces the damage taken from enemy sub weapons. Autobombs, Curling Bombs, Ink Mines, Splat Bombs, and Suction Bombs have their damage reduced by up to 50%. Burst Bombs have their damage reduced by up to 40%. Bomb Defense Up DX reduces the damage taken from special weapons by up to 35%. Bomb Defense Up DX is known to affect the Baller, Inkjet, Splashdown, and Tenta Missiles. The ability offers players a means of increasing survivability. For example, just one sub slot of the ability prevents the player from being splatted by two near-miss Inkjet shots. The damage reductions are never enough to prevent a one-hit splat.\n\nBomb Defense Up DX reduces the tracking duration of Point Sensors and Ink Mines, and changes the distance threshold for the white silhouette of Thermal Ink, Haunt, and the Sting Ray. As a player stacks more Bomb Defense Up DX, a Thermal Ink user must be farther away from the Bomb Defense Up DX users in order to see their Thermal Ink silhouette.\n\n- 1 Stacking\n\n- 2 Gear\n\n- 3 History\n\n- 4 Version history\n\n- 5 Names in other languages\n\n5.1 Translation notes\n\n- 5.1 Translation notes\n\n- 6 See also\n\n- 7 References\n\n- 5.1 Translation notes\n\n[1]\n\nThe number of hits a weapon needed to splat the player with every threshold for Bomb Defense Up DX is shown in the following table.
