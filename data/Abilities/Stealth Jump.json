It is restricted to shoes as a primary ability.\n\nStealth Jump hides the user's landing marker; in Splatoon 2, except for players who are within a certain distance to it. In Splatoon, total jump duration is increased by 50 frames.\n\n- 1 Splatoon\n\n1.1 Gear\n1.2 Mechanics\n1.3 Tactics\n1.4 Version history\n1.5 Gallery\n\n- 1.1 Gear\n\n- 1.2 Mechanics\n\n- 1.3 Tactics\n\n- 1.4 Version history\n\n- 1.5 Gallery\n\n- 2 Splatoon 2\n\n2.1 Clarification\n2.2 Gear\n2.3 Version history\n\n- 2.1 Clarification\n\n- 2.2 Gear\n\n- 2.3 Version history\n\n- 3 Splatoon 3\n\n3.1 Gear\n\n- 3.1 Gear\n\n- 4 Names in other languages\n\n- 5 References\n\n- 1.1 Gear\n\n- 1.2 Mechanics\n\n- 1.3 Tactics\n\n- 1.4 Version history\n\n- 1.5 Gallery\n\n- 2.1 Clarification\n\n- 2.2 Gear\n\n- 2.3 Version history\n\n- 3.1 Gear\n\nStealth Jump is the primary ability of:\n\n- Stealth Jump hides the user's landing point marker normally visible to all players when performing a Super Jump from opponents and allies alike.\n\n- 45 frames (approx. 0.750s) are added to the \"charge up\" phase of the Super Jump.\n\n- 5 frames (approx. 0.083s) are added to the \"in air\" phase.\n\nSuper Jumping close to where opponents are is significantly safer with this ability than without it, as it helps prevent opponents from anticipating it.\n\nHowever, Stealth Jump adds a significant amount of time to when the player is vulnerable while initiating a Super Jump. This largely invalidates the strategy of Super Jumping out of trouble when threatened by an opponent, even with maximum Quick Super Jump.\n\nQuick Respawn paired with this ability can further help the user quickly get back into action after they get splatted.\n\n- A graph showing the effects of stacking Quick Super Jump on a normal jump and a Stealth Jump. Retreat vulnerability time is also shown.\n\n- ▼ The amount of time it takes to Super Jump will be longer when using this ability.\n\n- ▼ When doing a Super Jump with this ability equipped, you can't perform any attacks until you have completely landed.\n\nStealth Jump hides the user's Super Jump landing marker, except for players who are within a certain distance to it; (as a result, the only players who are able to see the landing marker are those who are close enough to it). For players within a certain range of distance to that landing marker, the transparency of that landing marker is increased as the distance from the player to it increases.\n\nThe distance that Stealth Jump becomes effective at is equal to about 3 tiles in the center area of Inkblot Art Academy.[1]\n\n- The area of effect of Stealth Jump is spherical, not cylindrical. As a result, a Stealth Jump landing marker is invisible to a player that is directly above and too far from that landing marker.\n\n- Even if the landing point indicator is not initially visible, it can still become visible if the player steps within the small radius around it.\n\n- The landing point of a Stealth Jump user is equally hidden from enemies and allies alike.\n\n- If a Stealth Jump user jumps to a Squid Beakon and it is destroyed before landing, the ability will still have its effects.\n\n- Does not affect the Super Jump's duration unlike in Splatoon, nor does it decrease the effectiveness of Quick Super Jump.\n\nStealth Jump is the primary ability of:\n\n- ▲ Stealth Jump no longer increases Super Jump duration.\n\n- ▼ Stealth Jump user's Super Jump landing marker can be seen by players who are close enough to the landing spot.\n\nStealth Jump is the primary ability of:\n\nAdditionally, Murch or Spyke can replace the primary ability on a pair of shoes with Stealth Jump by using 15 of each of the following ability chunks:\n\n- Quick Super Jump\n\n- Sub Resistance Up\n\n- Intensify Action"
