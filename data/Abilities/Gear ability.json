  "content": "Gear abilities, or simply abilities, are special attributes that are placed on wearable gear in the Splatoon series. Each provides different effects in Turf Wars and Ranked Battles, and the strength of said effects is usually based on the amount of the specific ability the player has.\n\n- 1 Primary abilities\n\n1.1 Primary-only abilities and mutual exclusivity\n\n- 1.1 Primary-only abilities and mutual exclusivity\n\n- 2 Secondary abilities\n\n2.1 Rolling probability\n\n2.1.1 Examples\n\n- 2.1 Rolling probability\n\n2.1.1 Examples\n\n- 2.1.1 Examples\n\n- 3 Stacking\n\n- 4 Splatoon\n\n4.1 List of abilities\n\n- 4.1 List of abilities\n\n- 5 Splatoon 2\n\n5.1 List of abilities\n5.2 Retired abilities\n\n5.2.1 Version 4.3.0\n\n- 5.1 List of abilities\n\n- 5.2 Retired abilities\n\n5.2.1 Version 4.3.0\n\n- 5.2.1 Version 4.3.0\n\n- 6 Splatoon 3\n\n6.1 List of abilities\n\n- 6.1 List of abilities\n\n- 7 Gallery\n\n- 8 Names in other languages\n\n- 9 References\n\n- 10 External links\n\n- 1.1 Primary-only abilities and mutual exclusivity\n\n- 2.1 Rolling probability\n\n2.1.1 Examples\n\n- 2.1.1 Examples\n\n- 2.1.1 Examples\n\n- 4.1 List of abilities\n\n- 5.1 List of abilities\n\n- 5.2 Retired abilities\n\n5.2.1 Version 4.3.0\n\n- 5.2.1 Version 4.3.0\n\n- 5.2.1 Version 4.3.0\n\n- 6.1 List of abilities\n\nAll pieces of gear come with exactly one specific primary ability (also called the main ability, often colloquially referred to as simply \"main\"). Stackable main abilities provide 10 AP each.\n\nTitles before Splatoon 3, which allows replacing the primary ability with ability chunks, do not allow changing the primary ability after obtaining the piece of gear it comes with. However, Splatoon 2 allows obtaining pieces of gear with an alternate primary ability: all pieces of gear that can be ordered via Murch (which mostly consist of ones that can be purchased from in-game shops) can also appear on the SplatNet 2 shop with a different primary ability than their default ones. Gear obtained through Salmon Run does not have a default primary ability and is instead randomly assigned from all abilities that can also appear as secondary abilities. Gear from the Nintendo Switch App SplatNet are randomly assigned primary abilities, but have a bias towards the brands more common ability.\n\nAll pieces of gear do not have primary abilities that match the gear's gear brand's favored ability (except for a few, which were originally sold through SplatNet 2). As a result, achieving all slots on a piece of gear to be the same ability (colloquially called \"pure\" gear) is more difficult. However, if the player is under the effects of the drink whose flavor corresponds to the ability they want, that ability will automatically become a favored ability regardless of the brand of their gear.\n\nSome abilities can only appear as primary abilities. These abilities are also tied to a certain type of gear (head, clothes, or shoes), making primary-only abilities on the same gear type mutually exclusive (e.g. the user can only have either Object Shredder or Stealth Jump since both are exclusive to the primary ability slot of shoe items) and prevent the user from stacking them (e.g. the user cannot have more than one main of Tenacity since it is exclusive to the primary ability slot of headgear items).\n\nThe groups of mutually exclusive abilities are as follows:\n\n- Comeback\n\n- Last-Ditch Effort\n\n- Opening Gambit\n\n- Tenacity\n\n- Cold Blooded\n\n- Haunt\n\n- Ninja Squid\n\n- Recon (ability)\n\n- Bomb Sniffer\n\n- Ink Resistance Up\n\n- Stealth Jump\n\n- Comeback\n\n- Last-Ditch Effort\n\n- Opening Gambit\n\n- Tenacity\n\n- Ability Doubler\n\n- Haunt\n\n- Ninja Squid\n\n- Respawn Punisher\n\n- Thermal Ink\n\n- Drop Roller\n\n- Object Shredder\n\n- Stealth Jump\n\n- Comeback\n\n- Last-Ditch Effort\n\n- Opening Gambit\n\n- Tenacity\n\n- Ability Doubler\n\n- Haunt\n\n- Ninja Squid\n\n- Respawn Punisher\n\n- Thermal Ink\n\n- Drop Roller\n\n- Object Shredder\n\n- Stealth Jump\n\nIn addition to their primary abilities, all pieces of gear have up to three slots for secondary abilities (or sub abilities,[1] casually referred to as \"subs\" by most players), which are stackable and provide 3 AP each.\n\nThe number of secondary ability slots that are present by default is equal to the number of stars (rarity) on the gear. If a piece of gear has less than three secondary ability slots, they can be added by Spyke or Murch with a Super Sea Snail (or 30,000 cash at level 20 or above in Splatoon) for each slot. Super sea snails can also be used to pay for all secondary slots to be rerolled.\n\nAll gear comes with empty secondary ability slots (unless obtained via ordering from another player via Spyke or Murch, which has a chance of inheriting the original gear's filled secondary ability slots). Secondary abilities on a piece of gear are obtained by getting experience points from online battles (except for Private Battles) while that gear is equipped. Higher rarity gear requires more points per slot, and each progressive secondary ability on the same gear requires more points to obtain than the previous secondary ability. In Splatoon 2, having a drink from Crust Bucket actively increases gear experience points awarded by 50%, and while the Splatfests were occurring, the Splatfest Tee instead required 7,500 points per slot for a total of 22,500 points.\n\nThe following tables show the amount of gear experience required to obtain a secondary ability on a gear item of a given rarity. Numbers denoted with asterisks (*) represent secondary ability slots that must be added by Spyke or Murch.\n\nIn Splatoon 2, the player can alternatively apply ability chunks (which are specific to each secondary ability) to add or overwrite a secondary ability via Murch. Unless there are no remaining empty secondary ability slots after adding a secondary ability, adding abilities this way retains the previous amount of gear experience points. The required amount of chunks per slot depends on the number of existing copies of the desired secondary ability on one gear. The primary ability is not counted for this calculation. The amounts are:\n\n- 10 chunks for the first copy;\n\n- 20 chunks for the second copy; and\n\n- 30 chunks for the third copy.\n\nFor example, a gear with three secondary ability slots has one Run Speed Up and one Swim Speed Up as its secondary abilities.\n\n- 20 Run Speed Up chunks are needed to apply Run Speed Up to the empty third sub-slot since one sub of Run Speed Up is already present on the gear.\n\n- 10 Special Saver chunks are needed to apply Special Saver to the empty third sub-slot since no sub of Special Saver is already present on the gear.\n\n- 20 Swim Speed Up chunks are needed to replace Run Speed Up on the first sub-slot with Swim Speed Up since one sub of Swim Speed Up is already present on the gear.\n\nIn Splatoon, there are 13 possible secondary abilities; in Splatoon 2, there are 14. Gear brands that affect roll probability have a ×5 chance of rolling its favored ability and a ×0.5 chance of rolling its unfavored ability. Secondary abilities are assigned using random number generation.\n\nIn Splatoon 2, drink tickets affect the probability of receiving a specific secondary ability when enough gear experience points are obtained after an online match. Drink tickets do not affect Murch's rerolling, unlike gear brands.[2]\n\nHere are some examples to help with interpreting the table:\n\nIn Splatoon 2, the Aloha Shirt's brand is Forge which is a favoring brand as it favors Special Power Up, unfavors Ink Saver (Sub), and is neutral towards all other abilities.\n\n- With no drink ticket or when rerolling via Murch: The Aloha Shirt has a 2.332…% chance of rolling Special Power Up at least 3 times in a row, a 0.00233…% chance of rolling Ink Saver (Sub) at least 3 times in a row, and a 0.0186…% chance of rolling any other specific ability at least 3 times in a row.\n\n- With the Special-Up Smoothie drink ticket (boosts Special Power Up probability): The Aloha Shirt has a 9% chance of rolling Special Power Up at least 2 times in a row, a 0.0784% chance of rolling Ink Saver (Sub) at least 2 times in a row, and a 0.3136% chance of rolling any other specific ability at least 2 times in a row.\n\n- With the Sub-Saver Berry drink ticket (boosts Ink Saver (Sub) probability): The Aloha Shirt has a 20.588…% chance of rolling Special Power Up, a 30% chance of rolling Ink Saver (Sub), and a 4.117…% chance of rolling any other specific ability.\n\n- With any other drink ticket: The Aloha Shirt has a 21.212…% chance of rolling Special Power Up, a 0.0449…% chance of rolling Ink Saver (Sub) at least 2 times in a row and a 2.7% chance of rolling any other specific ability at least 3 times in a row.\n\nGear with a non-favoring brand has an equal probability of rolling any specific rollable ability. For example, in Splatoon 2, the Armor Jacket Replica has the Cuttlegear brand, which does not favor any ability.\n\n- With no drink ticket or when rerolling via Murch: The Armor Jacket Replica has a 7.142…% chance of rolling Swim Speed Up.\n\n- With a Swim-Speed Apple drink ticket (boosts Swim Speed Up probability): The Armor Jacket Replica has a 9% chance of rolling Swim Speed Up at least 2 times in a row.\n\n- With any other drink ticket: The Armor Jacket Replica has a 0.0156…% chance of rolling Swim Speed Up at least 3 times in a row.\n\nPlayers can use more of an ability (stacking an ability) to achieve stronger effects. For exact details on the effects of stacking each gear ability, see the ability's article.\n\nIn general, the more a specific ability is stacked, the less additional effect is accumulated. The degree to which this occurs depends on the ability. To demonstrate this concept, the following charts show the stacking effects for some abilities. Note the diminishing returns as more of the same ability is used.\n\n- Splatoon\n\n- Splatoon 2\n\nSpyke, who can be found in an alleyway in Inkopolis Plaza, offers to increase the number of secondary gear ability slots (to a maximum of three slots) or reroll secondary abilities in exchange for a Super Sea Snail (or 30,000 cash if the player is at level 20 or above and has no Super Sea Snails).\n\nSome abilities do not affect certain things, and in-game descriptions do not inform players of these exceptions. For example, Bomb Range Up does not affect some bombs. Another notable example is that Run Speed Up does not affect the run speed while pushing a roller.\n\nMurch, who can be found in Inkopolis Square, has multiple services that can affect a gear item's secondary abilities:\n\nIf an occupied slot is overwritten, one ability chunk of the overwritten ability will be provided.\n\nThe number of secondary gear abilities already on the gear that match the desired secondary ability is used to determine the cost.\n\n- Reduces damage taken from sub weapons and special weapons.\n\n- Shortens the duration of position trackers.\n\n- Increases the minimum visible distance of white silhouette trackers.\n\nThe following abilities were once present in the game but were later removed or replaced:\n\n- Shortened the duration of position trackers.\n\n- Increased the minimum visible distance of white silhouette trackers.\n\nIn version 4.3.0, the following ability replacements took place:\n\n- All existing gear slots and ability chunks for Bomb Defense Up and Cold-Blooded were replaced with Bomb Defense Up DX.\n\n- Gear items available in shops that had Cold-Blooded as the main ability changed to Main Power Up.\n\n- The following exclusive gear items that had Cold-Blooded as the main ability changed to Bomb Defense Up DX:\n Fringed Loafers\n Gray FA-11 Bomber\n Pearlescent Crown\n\n- Fringed Loafers\n\n- Gray FA-11 Bomber\n\n- Pearlescent Crown\n\n- Fringed Loafers\n\n- Gray FA-11 Bomber\n\n- Pearlescent Crown\n\nPer the Splatoon 3 Splatfest World Premiere, the abilities listed below feature in the game. Bomb Defense Up DX and Main Power Up do not return[4], being superseded by Sub Resistance Up and Intensify Action respectively.\n\nNew to Splatoon 3, Murch can replace the primary ability of a piece of gear for 45 ability chunks. This also gives the player 6 chunks of the replaced ability. Installing primary slot-only abilities requires 15 and gives 2 chunks of three specific abilities (for a total of 45 and 6 chunks, respectively). For the Splatfest Tee, the installation cost is reduced to 6 chunks (for non-exclusive abilities) or 2 chunks of three abilities (for primary slot-only abilities).\n\n- Locked ability icon from Splatoon.\n\n- Locked ability icon from Splatoon, no background.\n\n- Diagram of abilities and brands in Splatoon, which brand favors and unfavors each ability.\n\n- Diagram of abilities and brands in Splatoon 3, which brand favors and unfavors each ability.\n\n- Promo image of the abilities in Splatoon 2.\n\n- Splatoon ability calculator\n\n- Splatoon 2 ability calculator\n\n- Splatoon 2 ability effect tool\n\n- Dead link:  Splatoon 2 popular abilities and gear loadouts.
