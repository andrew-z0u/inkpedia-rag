  "content": "Defense Up is an ability in Splatoon that reduces damage taken from all attacks by up to 30%. Inkline gear has a 5x chance of rolling this ability.\n\n- 1 Use\n\n- 2 Gear\n\n- 3 Stacking\n\n3.1 Calculating damage\n\n- 3.1 Calculating damage\n\n- 4 Gallery\n\n- 5 Names in other languages\n\n- 3.1 Calculating damage\n\nUnlike Damage Up, Defense Up can lower thresholds on certain enemy weapons. For example, the .52 Gal does 52 base damage, which is a two-shot splat on normal Inklings. Defense Up can drop the weapon's damage to below 50, making it a three-shot splat with the .52 Gal. This allows players to take extra hits from certain weapons. However, if an opponent has Damage Up, then the effect is canceled out, as the damage boost will again bring the weapons' \"shots-to-splat\" back up to normal.\n\n.52 Gal and .96 Gal become 3-hit splats at 3 subs. Sploosh-o-matic becomes a 4-hit splat at 3 mains. Splattershot and Hydra Splatling become 4-hit splats at 1 main. L-3 Nozzlenose becomes a 5-hit splat at 3 mains and 2 subs. Dual Squelcher, Splash-o-matic, N-ZAP '85, Splattershot Jr., Inkbrush, Mini Splatling, and Heavy Splatling become a 5-hit splat at 1 main and five subs. Octobrush becomes a 4-hit splat at 1 main and 4 subs.\n\nDefense Up is the main ability of:\n\n- Graph showing the effect of stacking Defense Up to defend against 2-hit+ splat weapons.\n\n- An Inkling wearing an outfit with all Defense Up mains.\n\n- Squid Bumpers in the test range with one, two, and three mains of Defense Up.\n\n- Squid Bumpers showing the difference in Damage from one shot of a Splattershot Jr. between one, two and three mains of Defense Up."
