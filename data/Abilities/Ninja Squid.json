    "Ninja Squid is a gear primary ability in the Splatoon series.",
    "Users of Ninja Squid do not leave ripples while swimming in ink on non-wall surfaces (it does not hide ripples when swimming on 'wall' surfaces). The slight indents left in ink when swimming through it still appear. Swim speed is reduced.",
    "Ninja Squid is used by players who want to move around the battlefield undetected. Since there are no ripples for enemies to spot while the player swims, they can sneak to a better vantage point or escape a dangerous situation. However, slight indents left in ink can be seen, allowing very perceptive players to still take notice of the player's presence. Ninja Squid is useful for players which want to move into the center undetected.",

    "One way a player could use this ability is ambush. For example, if in a Tower Control Anarchy Battle, one could swim in their team's ink and do a Triple Splashdown on the tower for the purpose of splatting the enemy and claiming the Tower at the same time.",

Ninja Squid users are also visible while storing their charge as there is a white circle that appears on top of the user while they are doing so.",
