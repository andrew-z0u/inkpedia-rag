Since there are no ripples for enemies to spot while the player swims, they can sneak to a better vantage point or escape a dangerous situation. However, slight indents left in ink can be seen, allowing very perceptive players to still take notice of the player's presence. Ninja Squid is useful for players which want to move into the center undetected.\n\nNinja squid also reduces swim speed; this effect can be counteracted using Swim Speed Up. The effects of Ninja Squid can be simulated by swimming more slowly, as ripples are only produced when swimming at faster than a certain speed.\n\nOne way a player could use this ability is ambush. For example, if in a Tower Control Anarchy Battle, one could swim in their team's ink and do a Triple Splashdown on the tower for the purpose of splatting the enemy and claiming the Tower at the same time.\n\nNinja Squid is the primary ability of:\n\n- ▼ Swim speed will be lowered when using this ability.\n\nWithout Ninja Squid, ripples are produced by even slower speeds compared to Splatoon. Players must be cautious when under the effects of Ink Armor, as the glowing eyes that are given by the armor render the player fully visible in squid form even with Ninja Squid on. Ninja Squid users are also visible while storing their charge as there is a white circle that appears on top of the user while they are doing so.\n\nNinja Squid is the primary ability of:\n\n- ▼ Ninja Squid will now nullify roughly 20% of the effect provided by the player's Swim Speed Up gear ability.\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S2_Ability_Ninja_Squid_on_display.mp4\n\n\nAnimation of a swimming player with the Ninja Squid ability.
