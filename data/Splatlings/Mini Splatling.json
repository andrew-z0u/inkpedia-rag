    "The Mini Splatling is a main weapon in the Splatoon series.",
    "It has a very short charge time, needing approximately 0.33 seconds to reach the first level of charge, and 0.5 seconds to reach the second level of charge. It has more maneuverability than the Heavy Splatling. However, its range is significantly shorter than the Heavy Splatling, with a lower firing duration, only shooting for 0.6 seconds at the first level of charge and 1.2 seconds at the second level of charge. Each fully charged attack consumes 15% of the ink tank capacity, allowing users to fire six full charges before needing to refill. Each ink bullet deals enough damage to splat opponents in four hits.",
    "The appearance of the Mini Splatling vastly differs between games. In Splatoon, the Mini Splatling has a green handle and multiple red barrels that are held together with dark green supports. The ink tank is below the gun and the two connect via a red tube. In Splatoon 2, the Mini Splatling retains the same general structure, but the ink tank is more to the side of the gun than below it. In Splatoon 2, the handle is purple, the barrels are white, and the supports are blue. In both games, the ink tank changes color to match the user's ink. In Splatoon 3, some of the supports are yellow and the handle and other supports are purple, and the tank resembles the body of the Splattershot.",
    "The Mini Splatling was released on 5 September 2015 at 02:00 UTC.[1][2] It comes with Suction Bombs and the Inkzooka.",

    "- While Main Power Up will increase the number of shots fired, it will not increase the ink consumption relative to the amount charged, making the weapon comparatively more ink efficient.",

    "- In Splatoon, this weapon is the only weapon unlocked at level 8 that does not have the Inkstrike as its special.",
    "Mini Splatling is derived from Mini, and a portmanteau of Splat and Gatling.",
    "スプラスピナー Supura Supinā is a combination of either Splat or Splash, and Spinner. Spinner is due to the fact that the barrels of the Mini Splatling rotate while charging and firing."
