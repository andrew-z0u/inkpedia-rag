    "The Hydra Splatling is a main weapon in the Splatoon series.",
    "The Hydra Splatling must be charged up to fire a continuous spray of ink, like all splatlings. It distinguishes itself from the others by having the longest range and slowest charge time. It is the only splatling capable of splatting opponents with three ink bullets, as it has an exclusive high-damage feature that activates when the weapon is fully charged. The Hydra Splatling's mobility is low, so speed is impaired when it is equipped, even when not attacking with the weapon.",
    "The Hydra Splatling mainly consists of a large silver tank connected to a red body via a yellow tube. The tank has several white warning labels on it as well as some red text. The body has three silver barrels with gold tips sticking out of it.",
    "In Splatoon 3, the Hydra Splatling received a redesign. The large silver tank has been made slightly larger, with the Custom logo being flipped vertically, the hydrant has been remodeled, adding a coil and a handle and an interconnecting attachment added to the barrels.",
    "The Hydra Splatling was released on 21 November 2015 at 02:00 UTC.[1][2] It comes in a set with Splat Bombs and Echolocator.",

    "- H05 Ink It Station",
    "- A fully charged Hydra Splatling has enough power to shoot down somebody using the Booyah Bomb and still have shots left to spare. Unfortunately, the window of time required to properly execute this is fairly tight, almost always requiring the Hydra to have been charged preemptively.\nIt takes exactly 21 shots from a fully-charged Hydra Splatling to destroy the shield, with an additional 3 to splat the user.",

    "For competitive tips about the Hydra Splatling",
    "- At 35% of the ink capacity for full charges, the Hydra Splatling has the most ink consumption in the first two games. In Splatoon 3, it is tied with the Snipewriter 5H, which also consumes 35% ink capacity for a full charge.",
    "- This weapon has the highest damage per second in Splatoon 2 with a full charge, with 600 damage per second.",
    "- The Hydra Splatling was one of the weapons that was available to use in the Splatoon 3 Splatfest World Premiere.",
    "Hydra Splatling is derived from Hydra, a mythological multi-headed water monster, and a portmanteau of Splat and Gatling. Hydra may also be short for Hydrant, since the Hydra Splatling is based on a fire hydrant in design.",
    "ハイドラント Haidoranto is derived from Hydrant and refers to a fire hydrant."
