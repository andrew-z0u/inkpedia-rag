  "content": "The Heavy Splatling Remix is a main weapon in Splatoon and Splatoon 2. It is a Heavy Splatling with a different set and color scheme.\n\nIt is capable of firing bursts of ink with long range, low damage, and a fast fire rate. Although relatively slow to charge, each ink bullet does enough damage to splat opponents in four hits.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Splatoon\n\n2.1 Data\n2.2 Quotes\n2.3 Gallery\n2.4 Demonstration\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Quotes\n\n- 2.3 Gallery\n\n- 2.4 Demonstration\n\n- 3 Splatoon 2\n\n3.1 Data\n3.2 Version history\n3.3 Quotes\n3.4 Gallery\n3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 4 Strategy\n\n- 5 Trivia\n\n- 6 Etymology\n\n6.1 Names in other languages\n6.2 Translation notes\n\n- 6.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 6.2 Translation notes\n\n- 7 Notes\n\n- 8 References\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Quotes\n\n- 2.3 Gallery\n\n- 2.4 Demonstration\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 6.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 6.2 Translation notes\n\nThe Heavy Splatling Remix is nearly identical in appearance to the Heavy Splatling. In Splatoon, the only differences between the two is that the Heavy Splatling Remix has a sticker bearing the Chirpy Chips logo on the front and side of the water jug and a more neon color scheme. In Splatoon 2, the sticker is still present, but unlike the Splatoon 2 Heavy Splatling, the Heavy Splatling Remix's water jug is horizontal to the barrel instead of being diagonal, as it is in Splatoon.\n\nThe Heavy Splatling Remix was released on 8 June 2016 as part of Sheldon's Picks Vol. 2. Its set consists of Sprinkler and Killer Wail.\n\n- The Heavy Splatling Remix is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- A full charge consumes 22.5% of the ink tank capacity.\nThis allows players to fully charge 4 times before needing to refill the ink tank.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This allows players to fully charge 4 times before needing to refill the ink tank.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- The Heavy Splatling Remix cannot store its charge.\n\n- The Heavy Splatling Remix is not rechargeable while firing.\n\n- When charging the weapon, it will take 50 frames in order to charge its first ring and 75 frames in total for a full charge.\n\n- With a single ring charged, it will have a firing duration of 72 frames.

The outer reticle will finish shrinking after 45 frames.\n\n- The chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle increases by 2% per shot, and maximizes at a 30% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle.\nThis means that it takes 15 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- This means that it takes 15 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- When jumping, the chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle is immediately set to 30%.\n\n- Accuracy starts recovering 4 frames after the player stops shooting.\n\n- Within the first charge ring, initial shot velocity scales from 10.5 to 21 units per frame. Within the second charge ring, initial shot velocity is always 21 units per frame. Shots travel straight at the initial velocity for 8 frames. At maximum charge, shots travel straight for 168 distance units.\n\n- Ink droplets occur every 200 units.\n\n- The frequency at which ink drips from a shot occurs at a rate of 1 droplets per shot.\n\n- There are a total of 8 different droplet patterns that can be created while firing this weapon.\n\n- Droplets that occur within 11 units of the player have a radius of 19.2 units.\n\n- Droplets that occur when they travel past 200 units of the player have a radius of 18 units.\n\n- All other ink droplets have a radius of 14 units.\n\n- This means that it takes 15 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n[1]\n\nThe Heavy Splatling Remix is a, uh, remixed version of the Heavy Splatling with very similar capabilities. \nYou'll find the Sprinkler and Main weapon charge up the Killer Wail in no time at all! \nThis set is perfect for a battlefield artiste who likes to set the tempo of an engagement! \n(NA)\n\n\"The Heavy Splatling Remix is an, uh, remixed version of the Heavy Splatling, with very similar capabilities. \nYou'll find the Sprinkler and Main weapon charge up the Killer Wail in no time at all! \nThis set is perfect for a battlefield artiste who likes to set the tempo of an engagement! \n(EU/OC)\n\n- Promotional image.\n\n- A female Inkling holding the Heavy Splatling Remix.\n\n- Firing the Heavy Splatling Remix.\n\n- Back view.\n\n- SplatNet icon\n\nThe Heavy Splatling Remix was released on 3 April 2019 at 01:00 UTC as part of Version 4.6.0.[3] Its set consists of Point Sensor and Booyah Bomb.\n\n- While Main Power Up increases the number of shots fired, it does not increase the ink consumption relative to the amount charged, making the weapon comparatively more ink efficient.\n\n- The Heavy Splatling Remix is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 210.

However, this connection is only indirectly addressed in-game, as Sheldon's description of the weapon contains multiple references to musical terms.\n\n- While the Heavy Splatling Remix did not initially appear in Splatoon 2 (as it was added in Version 4.6.0), the Heavy Splatling in that game has a similar set to the weapon's Splatoon iteration, albeit with Sting Ray replacing Killer Wail.\n\n- Unlike the other variants of the Heavy Splatling, the Heavy Splatling Remix completely retains its appearance from Splatoon in Splatoon 2. This trait is shared with the Soda Slosher.\n\nHeavy Splatling Remix is derived from the adjective Heavy and a portmanteau of Splat and Gatling plus the word Remix. Remix refers to the fact that the weapon is a remodeled Heavy Splatling, similar to how remix is used in musical media. Remix is also likely a reference to Chirpy Chips and their electronic music style, since the design of the Heavy Splatling Remix is inspired by them.\n\nバレルスピナーリミックス Bareru Supinā Rimikkusu is derived from Barrel and Spinner plus Remix. The name Barrel Spinner is because the barrels of the Heavy Splatling Remix rotate while charging and firing. Remix has the same reasoning as the English name."
