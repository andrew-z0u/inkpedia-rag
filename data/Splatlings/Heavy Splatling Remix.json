    "The Heavy Splatling Remix is a main weapon in Splatoon and Splatoon 2. It is a Heavy Splatling with a different set and color scheme.",
    "It is capable of firing bursts of ink with long range, low damage, and a fast fire rate. Although relatively slow to charge, each ink bullet does enough damage to splat opponents in four hits.",
    "The Heavy Splatling Remix is nearly identical in appearance to the Heavy Splatling. In Splatoon, the only differences between the two is that the Heavy Splatling Remix has a sticker bearing the Chirpy Chips logo on the front and side of the water jug and a more neon color scheme. In Splatoon 2, the sticker is still present, but unlike the Splatoon 2 Heavy Splatling, the Heavy Splatling Remix's water jug is horizontal to the barrel instead of being diagonal, as it is in Splatoon.",
    "The Heavy Splatling Remix was released on 8 June 2016 as part of Sheldon's Picks Vol. 2. Its set consists of Sprinkler and Killer Wail.",

    "The Heavy Splatling Remix was released on 3 April 2019 at 01:00 UTC as part of Version 4.6.0.[3] Its set consists of Point Sensor and Booyah Bomb.",
    "- While Main Power Up increases the number of shots fired, it does not increase the ink consumption relative to the amount charged, making the weapon comparatively more ink efficient.",

    "- The Heavy Splatling Remix is a Chirpy Chips-themed weapon[5], as it has a sticker on the side with their name in Inkling, its color scheme is similar to that of their album art, and \"Remix\" may be a reference to their electronic style. However, this connection is only indirectly addressed in-game, as Sheldon's description of the weapon contains multiple references to musical terms.",
    "- While the Heavy Splatling Remix did not initially appear in Splatoon 2 (as it was added in Version 4.6.0), the Heavy Splatling in that game has a similar set to the weapon's Splatoon iteration, albeit with Sting Ray replacing Killer Wail.",
    "- Unlike the other variants of the Heavy Splatling, the Heavy Splatling Remix completely retains its appearance from Splatoon in Splatoon 2. This trait is shared with the Soda Slosher.",
    "Heavy Splatling Remix is derived from the adjective Heavy and a portmanteau of Splat and Gatling plus the word Remix. Remix refers to the fact that the weapon is a remodeled Heavy Splatling, similar to how remix is used in musical media. Remix is also likely a reference to Chirpy Chips and their electronic music style, since the design of the Heavy Splatling Remix is inspired by them.",
    "バレルスピナーリミックス Bareru Supinā Rimikkusu is derived from Barrel and Spinner plus Remix. The name Barrel Spinner is because the barrels of the Heavy Splatling Remix rotate while charging and firing. Remix has the same reasoning as the English name."
