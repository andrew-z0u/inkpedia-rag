    "The Ballpoint Splatling is a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3. It is a splatling that changes its fire rate and range drastically after firing a short duration.[1]",
    "This splatling works differently from other splatlings, as its fire range is split into two stages. The first stage, which lasts a quarter-ring charge, is a short-range burst with a range similar to the Splattershot Jr. This stage fires faster compared to other splatlings, and has mobility slightly higher than the Mini Splatling. When charged more than a quarter ring, the range increases dramatically, having a range in between the Heavy Splatling and Hydra Splatling, and has almost perfect accuracy, but fires at a slightly slower rate compared to other splatlings.",
    "The Ballpoint Splatling has the ability to recharge itself by pressing  at any time while it is firing. When recharging, the weapon maintains the property of whichever stage it was on. However, a charge exceeding 1Â¾ rings automatically defaults the weapon back to the first stage. Additionally, the weapon is able to maintain its stage-two charge even after it has finished firing by starting another charge within a second.",
    "The Ballpoint Splatling resembles an enlarged multi-color ballpoint pen, with four ballpoint cartridges inside a clear cover. The grip is silver-colored and is shaped like a pen clip, while the stock is mostly black with four tabs that go around the stock; these tabs, along with the butt of the weapon, change color to match the player's ink. The forestock is transparent, and houses four tipped ink chambers that serve as barrels, which also change color depending on the player's ink. On the bottom of the forestock is a white grip. On the side of the stock is the Nouveau logo in white. While charging, the clickers, cartridges, and butt glow in the color of the player's ink. A light on the butt end of the weapon indicates which firing mode is active: the outer ring being lit indicates the high spread short range mode, and the inner circle being lit indicates the high precision long range mode. Additionally, when in long-range mode, one of the ink cartridges can be seen protruding from the barrel.",
    "Unlike other splatlings which are held parallel against the ground, the Ballpoint Splatling is held at a slight raised angle and is slightly rotated away from the body. Additionally, the Ballpoint Splatling shakes notably when firing in its short range mode but not when firing in its long range mode (this is especially visible in Splatoon 3). Sheldon's descriptions in both games seem to imply that this is caused by the rotation of the barrel, and is related to the bullet spread in its short range mode.",
    "The Ballpoint Splatling was first shown during the Splatoon 2 World Championship 2018, as part of the announcement of updates extending until December 2018. It was released on 1 July 2018 at 00:00 UTC.[2] It comes with Toxic Mist and the Inkjet.",

    "- The Ballpoint Splatling shares both its kit and unlock level with the Splash-o-matic.",
    "- When equipped with a full Run Speed Up gear set, the Ballpoint Splatling has the fastest Inkjet possible.",
    "- The Ballpoint Splatling, along with the Explosher and the Bloblobber, are the only main weapons to possess the dubious distinction of exclusively receiving nerfs through the various updates that followed their release.",
    "- Of the main weapons added to Splatoon 2 after Octo Expansion, the Ballpoint Splatling is the only one whose Splatoon 3 release special was not Ink Storm, the others being the Explosher, Bloblobber, and Nautilus 47.",
    "- The Ballpoint Splatling has never had a repeated sub weapon across any of its kits.\nWhen considering weapons that have been available across multiple games, this trait is shared only with the Tri-Slosher, and the Goo Tuber."
