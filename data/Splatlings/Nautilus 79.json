However, all the metal parts are slightly darker, and the rim of the shell and the handhold are outlined in gold.\n\nThe Nautilus 79 was released on 5 December 2018 at 02:00 UTC[1]. It comes with Suction Bombs and the Inkjet. It also has the ability to store a charge for up to 3⅓ seconds.\n\n- While Main Power Up increases the number of shots fired, it does not increase the ink consumption relative to the amount charged, making the weapon comparatively more ink efficient.\n\n- The Nautilus 79 is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 180. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The full charge ink consumption of 15% and ink tank capacity of 100% allows players to fully charge 6 times before needing to refill the ink tank.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- The Nautilus 79 can store its charge while submerged in ink.\nA stored charge can be held for up to 3.33 seconds.\nThe Nautilus 79 can store incomplete charges.\n\n- A stored charge can be held for up to 3.33 seconds.\n\n- The Nautilus 79 can store incomplete charges.\n\n- The delay between being submerged in ink with a stored charge and being able to fire the charge is 10 frames.\nThe delay between being submerged in ink with a stored charge and the outer reticle appearing is 5 frames.\n\n- The delay between being submerged in ink with a stored charge and the outer reticle appearing is 5 frames.\n\n- The Nautilus 79 is rechargeable while firing.\n\n- When charging the weapon, it will take 38 frames in order to charge its first ring and 76 frames in total for a full charge.\n\n- With a single ring charged, it will have a firing duration of 52 frames. With a full charge, it will have a firing duration of 104 frames.\n\n- When charging with an empty tank, the charge time is multiplied by 5.\n\n- When firing, it shoots a bullet every 4 frames.\n\n- When firing, the player's movement speed is set to 0.7 units per frame.\nWhen charging, the player's movement speed is set to 0.4 units per frame.\n\n- When charging, the player's movement speed is set to 0.4 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 40 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Each shot has a base damage of 32.\n\n- If a shot is in the air for more than 7 frames after being fired, it loses 2 damage per frame until it reaches 16 damage at frame 15.\n\n- Shots have a radius of 2 units.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while on the ground is 3.3 degrees.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while in the air is 3.6 degrees.\n\n- The outer reticle immediately expands after jumping. After 25 frames, the outer reticle will start shrinking, and will finish shrinking after 70 frames.\n\n- The Nautilus 79 has a 30% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle.\n\n- When jumping, the chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle is immediately set to 30%.\n\n- Initial shot velocity is 44.333 units per frame. Shots travel straight at the initial velocity for 3 frames.\nSo shots travel straight at a rate of 44.333 units per frame for 3 frames. Shots travel straight for 132.999 distance units.\n\n- So shots travel straight at a rate of 44.333 units per frame for 3 frames. Shots travel straight for 132.999 distance units.\n\n- After shots stop flying straight, the velocity is set to 18.215 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and decreases further as it travels.\n\n- Ink droplets occur every 120 units.\n\n- The frequency at which ink drips from a shot occurs at a rate of 1.5 droplets per shot.\n\n- There are a total of 8 different droplet patterns that can be created while firing this weapon.\n\n- Droplets that occur within 11 units of the player have a radius of 16.5 units, and a width of 0 units.\nThese droplets have their radius multiplied by a value ranging from 1.3 if they fell from a height above 100 units to 1.45 if they fell from a height below 30 units.\n\n- These droplets have their radius multiplied by a value ranging from 1.3 if they fell from a height above 100 units to 1.45 if they fell from a height below 30 units.\n\n- Droplets that occur when they travel past 200 units of the player have a radius of 14 units.\n\n- All other ink droplets have a radius of 12.6 units.\n\n- Droplets that are far from the player and all other droplets have their radius multiplied by a value ranging from 1.3 if they fell from a height above 100 units to 1.4 if they fell from a height below 30 units.\n\n- If no ink droplets have occurred within 11 units of the player for 4 shots, the next shot the player makes will force a paint droplet to appear at the player's feet.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- A stored charge can be held for up to 3.33 seconds.\n\n- The Nautilus 79 can store incomplete charges.\n\n- The delay between being submerged in ink with a stored charge and the outer reticle appearing is 5 frames.\n\n- When charging, the player's movement speed is set to 0.4 units per frame.\n\n- So shots travel straight at a rate of 44.333 units per frame for 3 frames. Shots travel straight for 132.999 distance units.\n\n- These droplets have their radius multiplied by a value ranging from 1.3 if they fell from a height above 100 units to 1.45 if they fell from a height below 30 units.\n\n[2]\n\n- ▲ Decreased shot variance when firing while on the ground by roughly 8%: 3.6 degrees → 3.3 degrees.\n\nThe Nautilus 79 functions like the Nautilus 47, but comes with an all new coat of paint!\nExert influence on the movement of your foes with the Suction Bombs, then store a charge and dash in to attack when the time is right!\nOnce you smell fear, pull out the Inkjet special and turn the tides of ink in your favor!\nThere's nothing painted-on about true battle skill!
