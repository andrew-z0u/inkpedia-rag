  "content": "The Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau is a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3. It is the Nouveau-branded version of the Ballpoint Splatling.\n\nSame as its original variant, this splatling works differently from other splatlings. It does not have a consistent range when firing in short bursts. There are two stages of firing with this weapon. The first stage only lasts for a quarter ring charge and has a range similar to the Splattershot Jr., fires faster than other splatlings, and has mobility slightly higher than the Mini Splatling. When charged more than a quarter ring, the range increases dramatically, having a range in between the Heavy Splatling and Hydra Splatling. During its second stage of firing, it has almost perfect accuracy but fires slightly slower than other splatlings.\n\nThe Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau can recharge itself by pressing  at any time while it is firing. When recharging the shots, the weapon maintains the property of whichever stage it was on. However, a charge exceeding 1Â¾ rings automatically defaults the weapon back to the first stage. Additionally, the weapon can maintain its stage two charge even after it has finished firing by starting another charge within one second.\n\nThe Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau has a nearly consistent charge rate for both rings. It takes 0.83 seconds to reach the first level of charge, and 1.66 seconds in total to reach the second level of charge. Once the first level of charge is reached, it fires for approximately 1.66 seconds, and once the second level of charge is reached, it fires for approximately 3.33 seconds.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Splatoon 2\n\n2.1 Data\n\n2.1.1 First stage\n2.1.2 Second stage\n\n\n2.2 Version history\n2.3 Quotes\n2.4 Gallery\n2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n2.1.1 First stage\n2.1.2 Second stage\n\n- 2.1.1 First stage\n\n- 2.1.2 Second stage\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3 Splatoon 3\n\n3.1 Data\n\n3.1.1 First stage\n3.1.2 Second stage\n\n\n3.2 Version history\n3.3 Quotes\n3.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n3.5 Gallery\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n3.1.1 First stage\n3.1.2 Second stage\n\n- 3.1.1 First stage\n\n- 3.1.2 Second stage\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 3.5 Gallery\n\n- 4 Strategy\n\n- 5 Trivia\n\n- 6 Names in other languages\n\n6.1 Translation notes\n6.2 Internal names\n\n- 6.1 Translation notes\n\n- 6.2 Internal names\n\n- 7 References\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n2.1.1 First stage\n2.1.2 Second stage\n\n- 2.1.1 First stage\n\n- 2.1.2 Second stage\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 2.1.1 First stage\n\n- 2.1.2 Second stage\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n3.1.1 First stage\n3.1.2 Second stage\n\n- 3.1.1 First stage\n\n- 3.1.2 Second stage\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 3.5 Gallery\n\n- 3.1.1 First stage\n\n- 3.1.2 Second stage\n\n- 6.1 Translation notes\n\n- 6.2 Internal names\n\nThe Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau has the same appearance as the Ballpoint Splatling, but has a Nouveau sticker on the back end.
