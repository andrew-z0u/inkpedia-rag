    "The Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau is a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3. It is the Nouveau-branded version of the Ballpoint Splatling.",
    "Same as its original variant, this splatling works differently from other splatlings. It does not have a consistent range when firing in short bursts. There are two stages of firing with this weapon. The first stage only lasts for a quarter ring charge and has a range similar to the Splattershot Jr., fires faster than other splatlings, and has mobility slightly higher than the Mini Splatling. When charged more than a quarter ring, the range increases dramatically, having a range in between the Heavy Splatling and Hydra Splatling. During its second stage of firing, it has almost perfect accuracy but fires slightly slower than other splatlings.",
    "The Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau can recharge itself by pressing  at any time while it is firing. When recharging the shots, the weapon maintains the property of whichever stage it was on. However, a charge exceeding 1Â¾ rings automatically defaults the weapon back to the first stage. Additionally, the weapon can maintain its stage two charge even after it has finished firing by starting another charge within one second.",
    "The Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau has a nearly consistent charge rate for both rings. It takes 0.83 seconds to reach the first level of charge, and 1.66 seconds in total to reach the second level of charge. Once the first level of charge is reached, it fires for approximately 1.66 seconds, and once the second level of charge is reached, it fires for approximately 3.33 seconds.",
    "The Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau has the same appearance as the Ballpoint Splatling, but has a Nouveau sticker on the back end. In Splatoon 3, its colors are also inverted, with the stock being white instead of black, and the grip being black instead of white.",
    "The Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau was announced on 24 November 2018. It was added to the game on 5 December 2018 as part of version 4.3.0.[1]",
