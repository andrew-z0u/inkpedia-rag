    "Emberz went big with custom decals on the Torrentz Hydra Splatling, so make them proud by going big in battle with this loadout! Now, for all their firepower, splatlings aren't known for their turf coverage. But the Sprinkler sub has you covered there! Put that Big Bubbler to use as well, and you'll be in business. I'd recommend this set to relentless players who want to keep pressuring the other team and look good while they're doing it.",

    "- The matchmaking range is 24.5. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.",
    "- The full charge ink consumption is 35%, allowing the user to fully charge 2.86 times on a full ink tank.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).",
    "- The Torrentz Hydra Splatling cannot store its charge.",
    "- It takes 120 frames to charge the first circle (2 seconds) and 150 frames to fully charge (2.5 seconds).\nWhen airborne or low on ink, it takes 360 frames to charge the first circle (6 seconds) and 450 frames to fully charge (7.5 seconds).",
    "- The Torrentz Hydra Splatling is not rechargeable while firing.",
    "- When charged to the first circle, the weapon will fire for 130 frames (2.17 seconds), and when fully charged, it will fire for 260 frames (4.33 seconds).\nThe firing duration is 1.08 times longer than the charging duration when charged to the first circle and 1.73 times longer when fully charged.",
    "- When firing continuously, it shoots a bullet every 4 frames (15 shots per second).",
    "- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.06 units per frame.\nWhen charging, the player's movement speed is set to 0.044 units per frame.",
    "- After firing, there is a 40 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.",
    "- Each shot has a base damage of 32. When the weapon is fully charged, the base damage increases to 40.",
    "- If a shot is in the air for more than 11 frames after being fired, it will lose about 2 damage every frame until it reaches 16 damage at frame 19.\nIf, when fully charged, a shot is in the air for more than 11 frames after being fired, it will lose about 3 damage every frame until it reaches 16 damage at frame 19.",

    "- Initial shot velocity scales with charge level. At minimum charge, it is 1.05 units per frame, and at once charge circle or more, it is 2.4 units per frame. Shots travel straight for 8 frames, regardless of charge level.\nAfter that, the shot's velocity is set to 1.94 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.",
    "- Effective range scales from 9.98 units to 21.94 units, depending on charge level.\nThis number may vary at different firing angles.",
