    "The Custom Hydra Splatling is a main weapon in the Splatoon series. It is a Hydra Splatling with Custom branding and a different loadout.",
    "The Hydra Splatling must be charged up to fire a continuous spray of ink, like all splatlings. It distinguishes itself from the others by having the longest range and slowest charge time. It is the only splatling capable of splatting opponents with three ink bullets, as it has an exclusive high-damage feature that activates when the weapon is fully charged. The Hydra Splatling's mobility is low, so speed is impaired when it is equipped, even when not attacking with the weapon.",
    "The Custom Hydra Splatling is nearly identical in appearance to the Hydra Splatling. The only two differences between the two is that the Custom Hydra Splatling has a sticker bearing the Custom logo on the side of the tank, and, in Splatoon 3, the addition of the hose that connects the tank to the weapon now being light blue instead of yellow.",
    "The Custom Hydra Splatling was released on 16 January 2016 at 02:00 UTC.[1][2] It was initially said to be the final weapon to be released before the release of Sheldon's Picks.[3][4] It comes as a set with Sprinklers and the Bubbler.",

    "- A fully charged Hydra Splatling has enough power to shoot down somebody using the Booyah Bomb and still have shots left to spare. Unfortunately, the window of time required to properly execute this is fairly tight, almost always requiring the Hydra to have been charged preemptively.\nIt takes exactly 21 shots from a fully-charged Hydra Splatling to destroy the shield, with an additional 3 to splat the user.",

    "- In Splatoon, at  29,900, the Custom Hydra Splatling is the most expensive splatling and the second most expensive weapon in the game.",
    "- After the Custom Hydra Splatling's release, Nintendo had stated that it would be the last downloadable weapon coming to Splatoon. However, on 3 March 2016 Nintendo Direct presentation contradicted this. It showed at least eight new weapons that would be released.",
    "- At  33,300, the Custom Hydra Splatling is the most expensive weapon in Splatoon 2.",
    "- While this weapon does have enough power to take down a player using a Booyah Bomb's armour in a single full charge, the timing is so precise the player may have thrown their bomb by the time the armor breaks. Main Power Up and Object Shredder can help with this.",
    "- In its Splatoon 3 reveal post by @SplatoonNA on Twitter, the weapon was mistakenly marked as having Point Sensor.[10] The tweet was later deleted, and a corrected one was posted.[9]",
    "Custom Hydra Splatling is derived from Custom; Hydra, a mythological multi-headed water monster, and a portmanteau of Splat and Gatling. Hydra may also be short for Hydrant, since the Custom Hydra Splatling is based on a fire hydrant in design. The prefix Custom is also used to differentiate it from the Hydra Splatling. This trait is shared among the other alternate sets of the Custom brand.",
    "ハイドラントカスタム Haidorantokasutamu is derived from Hydrant and Custom. Hydrant refers to a fire hydrant. Like the English name, \"Custom\" is also used to differentiate it from Hydrant."
