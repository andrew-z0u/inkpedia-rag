    "The Zink Mini Splatling is a main weapon in the Splatoon series. It is a Mini Splatling with Zink branding and a different loadout.",
    "It has a very short charge time, needing approximately 0.33 seconds to reach the first level of charge, and 0.5 seconds to reach the second level of charge. It has more maneuverability than the Heavy Splatling. However, its range is significantly shorter than the Heavy Splatling, with a lower firing duration, only shooting for 0.6 seconds at the first level of charge and 1.2 seconds at the second level of charge. Each fully charged attack consumes 15% of the ink tank capacity, allowing users to fire six full charges before needing to refill. Each ink bullet deals enough damage to splat opponents in four hits.",
    "The Zink Mini Splatling's appearance in each game is based on the default Mini Splatling variant from the same game with an added Zink branding.",
    "In Splatoon, the sticker of Zink's logo is pasted on the right side of the gun's ink tank, the splatling is green and orange, the frame is light green, and the ink tank is white by default.",
    "In Splatoon 2, tape strips with Zink's branding wraps the gun's barrel supports. The splatling is purple and pink. The tape wrapped around the weapon is yellow and blue to match Zink's Splatoon 2 logo. The ink tank is still white by default.",
    "In Splatoon 3, the gun's purple-and-yellow color scheme is changed to Zink's blue-and-white, as well as dark teal. The barrel support also bears Zink's white wordmark. The ink tank is still white by default.",
    "The Zink Mini Splatling was released on 12 December 2015 at  02:00 UTC.[1][2][3] It comes with Disruptors and the Bubbler.",

    "For competitive tips about the Zink Mini Splatling",
    "- In the North American version of Splatoon, when the player is splatted by a Zink Mini Splatling there is a space between the weapon name and the exclamation mark, reading \"Splatted by Zink Mini Splatling !\" instead of \"Splatted by Zink Mini Splatling!\" This is the only weapon for which this happens and is not present in other localizations. A space was also present after the name on SplatNet.\nThis issue is carried over to Splatoon 2, where it appears in all English versions and even affects SplatNet 2 and Callie's statistics.\nThis issue was fixed in Splatoon 3.",
    "Zink Mini Splatling is derived from Mini, a shortening of miniature, and a portmanteau of Splat and Gatling. It has the Zink brand name as a prefix to differentiate it from the Mini Splatling. It also denotes that the weapon is a collaboration with Zink.",
    "スプラスピナーコラボ Supura Supinā Korabo is a combination of either Splat or Splash, and Spinner. Spinner is due to the fact that the barrels of the Mini Splatling rotate while charging and firing. It also has the abbreviated prefix Collab to separate it from Splaspinner and to denote that it is a collaboration. However, unlike the English name, it does not specify the brand Zink."
