  "content": "The Zink Mini Splatling is a main weapon in the Splatoon series. It is a Mini Splatling with Zink branding and a different loadout.\n\nIt has a very short charge time, needing approximately 0.33 seconds to reach the first level of charge, and 0.5 seconds to reach the second level of charge. It has more maneuverability than the Heavy Splatling. However, its range is significantly shorter than the Heavy Splatling, with a lower firing duration, only shooting for 0.6 seconds at the first level of charge and 1.2 seconds at the second level of charge. Each fully charged attack consumes 15% of the ink tank capacity, allowing users to fire six full charges before needing to refill. Each ink bullet deals enough damage to splat opponents in four hits.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Splatoon\n\n2.1 Data\n2.2 Version history\n2.3 Quotes\n2.4 Gallery\n2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3 Splatoon 2\n\n3.1 Data\n3.2 Version history\n3.3 Quotes\n3.4 Gallery\n3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 4 Splatoon 3\n\n4.1 Data\n4.2 Version history\n4.3 Quotes\n4.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n4.5 Gallery\n\n- 4.1 Data\n\n- 4.2 Version history\n\n- 4.3 Quotes\n\n- 4.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 4.5 Gallery\n\n- 5 Strategy\n\n- 6 Trivia\n\n- 7 Etymology\n\n7.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 7.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 8 References\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 4.1 Data\n\n- 4.2 Version history\n\n- 4.3 Quotes\n\n- 4.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 4.5 Gallery\n\n- 7.1 Names in other languages\n\nThe Zink Mini Splatling's appearance in each game is based on the default Mini Splatling variant from the same game with an added Zink branding.\n\nIn Splatoon, the sticker of Zink's logo is pasted on the right side of the gun's ink tank, the splatling is green and orange, the frame is light green, and the ink tank is white by default.\n\nIn Splatoon 2, tape strips with Zink's branding wraps the gun's barrel supports. The splatling is purple and pink. The tape wrapped around the weapon is yellow and blue to match Zink's Splatoon 2 logo. The ink tank is still white by default.\n\nIn Splatoon 3, the gun's purple-and-yellow color scheme is changed to Zink's blue-and-white, as well as dark teal. The barrel support also bears Zink's white wordmark. The ink tank is still white by default.\n\nThe Zink Mini Splatling was released on 12 December 2015 at  02:00 UTC.[1][2][3] It comes with Disruptors and the Bubbler.\n\n- The Zink Mini Splatling is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- A full charge consumes 15% of the ink tank capacity.\nThis allows players to fully charge 6 times before needing to refill the ink tank.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This allows players to fully charge 6 times before needing to refill the ink tank.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- The Zink Mini Splatling cannot store its charge.\n\n- The Zink Mini Splatling is not rechargeable while firing.\n\n- When charging the weapon, it will take 18 frames in order to charge its first ring and 27 frames in total for a full charge.\n\n- With a single ring charged, it will have a firing duration of 36 frames.

First of all, we now have the Toxic Mist sub weapon to slow enemies down. Slow enemies make for good targets, so you're less likely to \"mist\" them with the Mini Splatling! Another good strategy with this loadout is to fire up the Big Bubbler and take cover while you're charging. Then you can burst forward, ready to launch an offensive! If you're new to splatlings, this set is user-friendly and ready to rock.

A space was also present after the name on SplatNet.\nThis issue is carried over to Splatoon 2, where it appears in all English versions and even affects SplatNet 2 and Callie's statistics.\nThis issue was fixed in Splatoon 3.\n\n- This issue is carried over to Splatoon 2, where it appears in all English versions and even affects SplatNet 2 and Callie's statistics.\n\n- This issue was fixed in Splatoon 3.\n\n- This issue is carried over to Splatoon 2, where it appears in all English versions and even affects SplatNet 2 and Callie's statistics.\n\n- This issue was fixed in Splatoon 3.\n\nZink Mini Splatling is derived from Mini, a shortening of miniature, and a portmanteau of Splat and Gatling. It has the Zink brand name as a prefix to differentiate it from the Mini Splatling. It also denotes that the weapon is a collaboration with Zink.\n\nスプラスピナーコラボ Supura Supinā Korabo is a combination of either Splat or Splash, and Spinner. Spinner is due to the fact that the barrels of the Mini Splatling rotate while charging and firing. It also has the abbreviated prefix Collab to separate it from Splaspinner and to denote that it is a collaboration. However, unlike the English name, it does not specify the brand Zink."
