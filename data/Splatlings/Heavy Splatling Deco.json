    "Heavy Splatling Deco is derived from the adjective Heavy, a portmanteau of Splat and Gatling, and Deco, short for either Decorated or Decoration. Deco may also refer to Art Deco. The suffix Deco is also used to differentiate it from the Heavy Splatling. This trait is shared among the other alternate sets of the Deco brand.",
    "バレルスピナーデコ Bareru Supinā Deko is derived from Barrel and Spinner, as well as Deco. The name Barrel Spinner is because the barrels of the Heavy Splatling Deco rotate while charging and firing. Like the English name, Deco is also used to differentiate it from Barrel Spinner."
