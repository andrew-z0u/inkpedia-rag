    "The Heavy Splatling Deco is a main weapon in the Splatoon series. It is a Deco-branded version of the Heavy Splatling.",
    "It is capable of firing bursts of ink with long range, low damage, and a fast fire rate. Although relatively slow to charge, each ink bullet does enough damage to splat opponents in four hits.",
    "The Heavy Splatling Deco is similar in appearance to the Heavy Splatling. However, the Heavy Splatling Deco has multiple rows of white and pink rhinestones arranged in the pattern of the Deco logo on the water jug and supports.",
    "The Heavy Splatling Deco was released on 7 November 2015 at 02:00 UTC.[1] It comes with Point Sensors and the Kraken.",
    "[2]",
    "The Heavy Splatling Deco is a Heavy Splatling that's been jazzed up a bit! With the Point Sensor and Kraken, your enemies will fall before your slow but unstoppable advance!(NA)",
    "The Heavy Splatling Deco is basically just a Heavy Splatling that's been jazzed up a bit! With the Point Sensor and Kraken, your enemies will fall before your slow but inexorable advance!(EU/OC)",
    "The Heavy Splatling Deco returns in Splatoon 2 with a new design.[3][4] It was released on 16 September 2017 at 02:00 UTC. It comes with Splash Walls and the Bubble Blower.",
    "[5]",
    "The Heavy Splatling Deco has the same stats as the Heavy Splatling, but it's been cosmetically enhanced! The Splash Wall protects you from your opponents' attacks while increasing your ink coverage! Once the groundwork is laid, use the combination of your splatling and the Bubble Blower special to expand your turf in the blink of an eye! I recommend this set to players who want to weave together solid strategy and fabulous style!",
    "The Heavy Splatling Deco returns in Splatoon 3 as part of the Sizzle Season 2023. It was shown in the season's trailer on 16 May 2023 on a Tableturf card, and also in promotional videos for the S-BLAST '92 and Painbrush on 17 May 2023 and 18 May 2023 respectively. It comes with Point Sensors and the Kraken Royale, which is a reference to its kit from Splatoon.",
    "[6]",
    "The Heavy Splatling Deco is simply a Heavy Splatling that's been cosmetically enhanced. That said, it also comes with a new loadout, including the Point Sensor! Fire up that sub to pinpoint a target, and... ba-ba-ba-BOOSH! Lay 'em out with the Heavy Splatling inkpower. Find yourself in a tight spot? That's when it's Kraken Royale time, friend. The only thing an enemy can do in the face of that special is run away. This is a unique loadout that will set you apart on the battlefield. Why not give it a shot?",
    "Heavy Splatling Deco is derived from the adjective Heavy, a portmanteau of Splat and Gatling, and Deco, short for either Decorated or Decoration. Deco may also refer to Art Deco. The suffix Deco is also used to differentiate it from the Heavy Splatling. This trait is shared among the other alternate sets of the Deco brand.",
    "バレルスピナーデコ Bareru Supinā Deko is derived from Barrel and Spinner, as well as Deco. The name Barrel Spinner is because the barrels of the Heavy Splatling Deco rotate while charging and firing. Like the English name, Deco is also used to differentiate it from Barrel Spinner.",
