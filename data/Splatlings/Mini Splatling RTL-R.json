The tank cap, the trigger and the six barrel tips are orange, while the reservoir and the hose connected to it are metallic. No part of the weapon changes color to match the user's ink. A decoration resembling a leather strap with a spiked metal tool is attached to the front of the weapon.\n\nThe Mini Splatling RTL-R was first revealed in the Splatlands Collection announcement trailer, and was released on 12 June 2025. Its kit consists of Squid Beakon and Trizooka.\n\n- The Mini Splatling RTL-R is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 15. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The full charge ink consumption is 15%, allowing the user to fully charge 6.67 times on a full ink tank.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- The Mini Splatling RTL-R cannot store its charge.\n\n- It takes 18 frames to charge the first circle (0.3 seconds) and 27 frames to fully charge (0.45 seconds).\nWhen airborne or low on ink, it takes 108 frames to charge the first circle (1.8 seconds) and 162 frames to fully charge (2.7 seconds).\n\n- When airborne or low on ink, it takes 108 frames to charge the first circle (1.8 seconds) and 162 frames to fully charge (2.7 seconds).\n\n- The Mini Splatling RTL-R is not rechargeable while firing.\n\n- When charged to the first circle, the weapon will fire for 42 frames (0.7 seconds), and when fully charged, it will fire for 84 frames (1.4 seconds).\nThe firing duration is 2.33 times longer than the charging duration when charged to the first circle and 3.11 times longer when fully charged.\n\n- The firing duration is 2.33 times longer than the charging duration when charged to the first circle and 3.11 times longer when fully charged.\n\n- When firing continuously, it shoots a bullet every 4 frames (15 shots per second).\n\n- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.086 units per frame.\nWhen charging, the player's movement speed is set to 0.072 units per frame.\n\n- When charging, the player's movement speed is set to 0.072 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 30 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Each shot has a base damage of 32, regardless of charge level.\nEach shot has a minimum damage of 16.\n\n- Each shot has a minimum damage of 16.\n\n- If a shot is in the air for more than 11 frames after being fired, it will lose about 2 damage every frame until it reaches 16 damage at frame 19.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with players has a radius of 0.2 units.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with the environment has a radius of 0.2 units.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while on the ground is 4.0 degrees.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while in the air is 8.0 degrees.\n\n- The Mini Splatling RTL-R has a 30% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle.\n\n- The outer reticle immediately expands after jumping. After 25 frames, the outer reticle will start shrinking, and will finish shrinking after 70 frames.\n\n- When jumping, the chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle is immediately set to 30%.\n\n- Initial shot velocity scales with charge level. At minimum charge, it is 1.05 units per frame, and at once charge circle or more, it is 1.5 units per frame. Shots travel straight for 8 frames, regardless of charge level.\nAfter that, the shot's velocity is set to 1.105 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 1.105 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- Effective range scales from 9.98 units to 13.65 units, depending on charge level.\nThis number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n- This number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- When airborne or low on ink, it takes 108 frames to charge the first circle (1.8 seconds) and 162 frames to fully charge (2.7 seconds).\n\n- The firing duration is 2.33 times longer than the charging duration when charged to the first circle and 3.11 times longer when fully charged.\n\n- When charging, the player's movement speed is set to 0.072 units per frame.\n\n- Each shot has a minimum damage of 16.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 1.105 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- This number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n[1]\n\n- ▼ Points to fill special gauge: 190 → 200.\n\nBarazushi has given the Mini Splatling a fierce makeover, and the result is the Mini Splatling RTL-R! It's the same great Mini Splatling performance with a tough new look. If I were headed into battle with this set, I'd call my allies with the Squid Beakon and then use my Trizooka special to open a breach. We'd snake in together and win the day! You do you, but I'd recommend this set to anyone who has similar daydreams about banding together as a team in victory.\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- Promotional image of the Barazushi collection\n\n- Promotional image of the Splatlands Collection - Barazushi weapons\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Mini_Splatling_RTL-R_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nPromotional video (link to file)\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Mini_Splatling_RTL-R_charge.mp4\n\n\nThe spinning barrel in action (link to file)\n\nThe suffix \"RTL-R\" is a stylized spelling of the word rattler, a common name for rattlesnakes, regarding the weapon's snake skin-like texture."
