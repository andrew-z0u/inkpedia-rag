Its straight tank makes it more similar looking to the Heavy Splatling from Splatoon, rather than the angled tank on the Splatoon 2 version.\n\n- Level 1\n\n- Level 2\n\n- 22.5% (Full charge)\n\nLv. 2\n\n- 16% (Full charge)\n\nThe Hero Splatling is usable in Octo Canyon and can be upgraded one level. Like all hero weapons of Splatoon 2, it comes with switchable sub weapons of Splat Bombs, Curling Bombs and Autobombs. It is loaned by Sheldon during the level, Dancing Floors, and can be used in missions after beating the level. Beating all missions in Octo Canyon with the weapon unlocks the Hero Splatling Replica for purchase at Ammo Knights.\n\nThe Hero Splatling Replica is a reward in Splatoon 2 unlocked for purchase at Ammo Knights by beating all missions with the Hero Splatling. It is a splatling-type main weapon and is visually identical to the Hero Splatling. Despite its unique appearance, it is simply a reskin of the Heavy Splatling, sharing the same stats and loadout, Sprinkler and Sting Ray.\n\n- The Hero Splatling's reveal in the first Splatoon 2 single player trailer\n\n- Hero Splatling Lv. 1\n\n- Hero Splatling Lv. 2\n\n- Despite being introduced in Splatoon 2, the Hero Splatling's appearance is mostly based on Heavy Splatling as it appears in Splatoon. Notably, the Hero Splatling has a horizontal drum like the old Heavy Splatling design rather than a tilted drum. Similarly, the Heavy Splatling Remix completely retains its appearance in Splatoon (including its horizontal drum) when it returns in Splatoon 2. This trait is shared with the Hero Slosher and its replica."
