  "content": "The Refurbished Mini Splatling is a main weapon in Splatoon. It is a Mini Splatling with a different loadout and a white-and-orange color scheme.\n\nIt has a very short charge time, needing approximately 0.33 seconds to reach the first level of charge, and 0.5 seconds to reach the second level of charge. It has more maneuverability than the Heavy Splatling. However, its range is significantly shorter than the Heavy Splatling, with a lower firing duration, only shooting for 0.6 seconds at the first level of charge and 1.2 seconds at the second level of charge. Each fully charged attack consumes 15% of the ink tank capacity, allowing users to fire six full charges before needing to refill. Each ink bullet deals enough damage to splat opponents in four hits.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Splatoon\n\n2.1 Data\n2.2 Version history\n2.3 Quotes\n2.4 Gallery\n2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3 Etymology\n\n3.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 3.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 4 References\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3.1 Names in other languages\n\nThe Refurbished Mini Splatling shares its overall design with the Mini Splatling.
