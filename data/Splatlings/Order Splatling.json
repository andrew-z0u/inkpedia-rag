Its appearance is similar to that of a Heavy Splatling. When firing, ring-shaped holograms manifest around the nozzles of the Splatling.\n\nThe Order Splatling is a weapon unlocked in Side Order, and is part of DJ Octavio's Palette. Its base set consists of Splash Walls and Booyah Bomb. However, this can be changed in the Spire of Order by using a vending machine.\n\nIt has lower stats in comparison to the Heavy Splatling, with lower damage, strafe speed, ink efficiency, range, and charge time. However, this can be upgraded through color chips in the Spire of Order.\n\n- The clear screen for the Order Splatling\n\n- The fail screen for the Order Splatling"
