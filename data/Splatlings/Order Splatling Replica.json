It is a reskin of the Heavy Splatling, and a direct successor to the Splatoon 2 Hero Splatling Replica.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Splatoon 3\n\n2.1 Unlocking\n2.2 Data\n2.3 Version history\n2.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n2.5 Gallery\n\n- 2.1 Unlocking\n\n- 2.2 Data\n\n- 2.3 Version history\n\n- 2.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 2.5 Gallery\n\n- 3 Strategy\n\n- 4 Names in other languages\n\n- 5 References\n\n- 2.1 Unlocking\n\n- 2.2 Data\n\n- 2.3 Version history\n\n- 2.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 2.5 Gallery\n\nThe Order Splatling Replica is designed to look like a simplified version of the Heavy Splatling, containing only white and gray colors.\n\nThe Order Splatling Replica comes with Sprinkler and Wave Breaker. The Order Splatling Replica's stats, sub weapon, and special weapon are identical to those of the Heavy Splatling.\n\nTo unlock the Order Splatling Replica, the player must complete Side Order with DJ Octavio's Palette.\n\n- The Order Splatling Replica is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 21. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The full charge ink consumption is 22.5%, allowing the user to fully charge 4.44 times on a full ink tank.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- The Order Splatling Replica cannot store its charge.\n\n- It takes 48 frames to charge the first circle (0.8 seconds) and 72 frames to fully charge (1.2 seconds).\nWhen airborne or low on ink, it takes 192 frames to charge the first circle (3.2 seconds) and 288 frames to fully charge (4.8 seconds).\n\n- When airborne or low on ink, it takes 192 frames to charge the first circle (3.2 seconds) and 288 frames to fully charge (4.8 seconds).\n\n- The Order Splatling Replica is not rechargeable while firing.\n\n- When charged to the first circle, the weapon will fire for 80 frames (1.33 seconds), and when fully charged, it will fire for 160 frames (2.67 seconds).\nThe firing duration is 1.67 times longer than the charging duration when charged to the first circle and 2.22 times longer when fully charged.\n\n- The firing duration is 1.67 times longer than the charging duration when charged to the first circle and 2.22 times longer when fully charged.\n\n- When firing continuously, it shoots a bullet every 4 frames (15 shots per second).\n\n- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.07 units per frame.\nWhen charging, the player's movement speed is set to 0.062 units per frame.\n\n- When charging, the player's movement speed is set to 0.062 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 40 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Each shot has a base damage of 30, regardless of charge level.\nEach shot has a minimum damage of 15.\n\n- Each shot has a minimum damage of 15.\n\n- If a shot is in the air for more than 11 frames after being fired, it will lose about 1.88 damage every frame until it reaches 15 damage at frame 19.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with players has a radius of 0.2 units.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with the environment has a radius of 0.2 units.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while on the ground is 3.3 degrees.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while in the air is 7.0 degrees.\n\n- The Order Splatling Replica has a 30% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle.\n\n- The outer reticle immediately expands after jumping. After 25 frames, the outer reticle will start shrinking, and will finish shrinking after 70 frames.\n\n- When jumping, the chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle is immediately set to 30%.\n\n- Initial shot velocity scales with charge level. At minimum charge, it is 1.05 units per frame, and at once charge circle or more, it is 2.1 units per frame. Shots travel straight for 8 frames, regardless of charge level.\nAfter that, the shot's velocity is set to 1.5105 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 1.5105 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- Effective range scales from 9.98 units to 18.98 units, depending on charge level.\nThis number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n- This number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- When airborne or low on ink, it takes 192 frames to charge the first circle (3.2 seconds) and 288 frames to fully charge (4.8 seconds).\n\n- The firing duration is 1.67 times longer than the charging duration when charged to the first circle and 2.22 times longer when fully charged.\n\n- When charging, the player's movement speed is set to 0.062 units per frame.\n\n- Each shot has a minimum damage of 15.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 1.5105 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- This number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n[1]\n\n- ▲ Increased firing duration by approximately 11%.\nFirst circle: 72 frames → 80 frames.\nFull charge: 144 frames → 160 frames.\n\n- First circle: 72 frames → 80 frames.\n\n- Full charge: 144 frames → 160 frames.\n\n- ▲ Reduced the time required to charge fully by approximately 1/20th of a second: 75 frames → 72 frames.\nWith this change, the time until the first level of charge ends is also reduced by approximately 1/30th of a second: 50 frames → 48 frames.\n\n- With this change, the time until the first level of charge ends is also reduced by approximately 1/30th of a second: 50 frames → 48 frames.\n\n- First circle: 72 frames → 80 frames.\n\n- Full charge: 144 frames → 160 frames.\n\n- With this change, the time until the first level of charge ends is also reduced by approximately 1/30th of a second: 50 frames → 48 frames.\n\n- 2D icon\n\nFor competitive tips about the Heavy Splatling"
