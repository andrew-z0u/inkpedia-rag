    "The Nautilus 47 is a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3. It is a splatling-type weapon that can store its charge.",
    "The weapon is a relatively shorter ranged splatling weapon with a range in between the Mini Splatling and Heavy Splatling, with a charge time roughly the same as the Heavy Splatling and a firing time also in between the Mini Splatling and Heavy Splatling. Its main differentiation from other splatlings is its ability to hold full and partial charges up to 3⅓ seconds while swimming in ink, like the Goo Tuber. It also loses very little accuracy while jumping. Like the Ballpoint Splatling, the Nautilus 47 can recharge while firing.",
    "The Nautilus 47 has a consistent charge rate for both rings. It takes approximately 0.63 seconds to reach the first level of charge, and approximately 1.26 seconds in total to reach the second level of charge. Once the first level of charge is reached, it fires for 1 second, and once the second level of charge is reached, it fires for 2 seconds.",
    "The Nautilus 47 has three short barrels sticking out of a metal head piece. They are connected to a short metal body piece using three black tubes with stripes that change color to match the user's ink. The body piece also houses a handhold. The main part of the Nautilus 47 is a round metal shell bearing the Ammo Knights logo, which protects its inner workings. On the side of the shell that faces the user's body is a tight metal coil that disappears into the body piece, as well as a light pink block that stops up the entrance to the body piece. The block is slightly visible from the side facing away from the user's body, and it seems to have a handle sticking out of it that changes color to match the user's ink. Going across the block on the handle side is an oddly bent reddish-brown tube that goes into the body piece.",
    "The Nautilus 47's design appears to be visually based on a wickless alcohol Bunsen burner. It also, as the name suggests, seems to be based on a nautilus, with the body piece being the shell, the handle being the eye, and the barrels being the tentacles.",
    "The Nautilus 47 was released on 1 August 2018 at 00:00 UTC.[1] It comes with Point Sensors and the Baller.",
    "[2]",
    "The Nautilus 47 is the first Splatling that allows you to store your charge while swimming in your ink! That means you can charge the weapon from a hidden position before sneakily swimming within range of unsuspecting enemies! This baby also has a stabilizer to keep your aim while jumping!\nThe Point Sensor sub will you help you spot opponents, while the Baller special allows you to push into enemy territory. If you want to catch the enemy off guard, this set's for you!",
    "The Nautilus 47 returns in Splatoon 3 with Point Sensor and Ink Storm as its kit.",
    "It appears in three missions in Return of the Mammalians:",
    "[3]",
    "The Nautilus 47 was the first splatling to allow you to store your charge while swimming in ink! It sounds like a small detail, but let me assure you...it's huge! It means you can charge undetected until you're ready to leap out and splat an unsuspecting opponent. Of course, this state-of-the-art weapon has a few other tricks up its sleeve as well... It can be paused midshot to charge. It has a stabilizer to keep your aim steady while you jump. And it makes an inkredible grilled cheese! Oh, I may have dreamed the last one... Anyway, with the Point Sensor sub and Ink Storm special to help read opponent positions, this loadout can make you feel like you're playing in Cod Mode!",
    "Nautilus refers to weapon's resemblance to the shell of a mollusc of the same name and 47 is the atomic number of silver, referring to the weapon's silver coloration.",
