  "content": "The Nautilus 47 is a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3. It is a splatling-type weapon that can store its charge.\n\nThe weapon is a relatively shorter ranged splatling weapon with a range in between the Mini Splatling and Heavy Splatling, with a charge time roughly the same as the Heavy Splatling and a firing time also in between the Mini Splatling and Heavy Splatling. Its main differentiation from other splatlings is its ability to hold full and partial charges up to 3⅓ seconds while swimming in ink, like the Goo Tuber. It also loses very little accuracy while jumping. Like the Ballpoint Splatling, the Nautilus 47 can recharge while firing.\n\nThe Nautilus 47 has a consistent charge rate for both rings. It takes approximately 0.63 seconds to reach the first level of charge, and approximately 1.26 seconds in total to reach the second level of charge. Once the first level of charge is reached, it fires for 1 second, and once the second level of charge is reached, it fires for 2 seconds.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Splatoon 2\n\n2.1 Data\n2.2 Version history\n2.3 Quotes\n2.4 Gallery\n2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3 Splatoon 3\n\n3.1 Data\n3.2 Version history\n3.3 Quotes\n3.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n3.5 Gallery\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 3.5 Gallery\n\n- 4 Trivia\n\n- 5 Etymology\n\n5.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 5.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 6 References\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 3.5 Gallery\n\n- 5.1 Names in other languages\n\nThe Nautilus 47 has three short barrels sticking out of a metal head piece. They are connected to a short metal body piece using three black tubes with stripes that change color to match the user's ink. The body piece also houses a handhold. The main part of the Nautilus 47 is a round metal shell bearing the Ammo Knights logo, which protects its inner workings. On the side of the shell that faces the user's body is a tight metal coil that disappears into the body piece, as well as a light pink block that stops up the entrance to the body piece. The block is slightly visible from the side facing away from the user's body, and it seems to have a handle sticking out of it that changes color to match the user's ink. Going across the block on the handle side is an oddly bent reddish-brown tube that goes into the body piece.\n\nThe Nautilus 47's design appears to be visually based on a wickless alcohol Bunsen burner. It also, as the name suggests, seems to be based on a nautilus, with the body piece being the shell, the handle being the eye, and the barrels being the tentacles.\n\nThe Nautilus 47 was released on 1 August 2018 at 00:00 UTC.[1] It comes with Point Sensors and the Baller.\n\n- While Main Power Up increases the number of shots fired, it does not increase the ink consumption relative to the amount charged, making the weapon comparatively more ink efficient.\n\n- The Nautilus 47 is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 180. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The full charge ink consumption of 15% and ink tank capacity of 100% allows players to fully charge 6 times before needing to refill the ink tank.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- The Nautilus 47 can store its charge while submerged in ink.\nA stored charge can be held for up to 3.33 seconds.\nThe Nautilus 47 can store incomplete charges.\n\n- A stored charge can be held for up to 3.33 seconds.\n\n- The Nautilus 47 can store incomplete charges.\n\n- The delay between being submerged in ink with a stored charge and being able to fire the charge is 10 frames.\nThe delay between being submerged in ink with a stored charge and the outer reticle appearing is 5 frames.\n\n- The delay between being submerged in ink with a stored charge and the outer reticle appearing is 5 frames.\n\n- The Nautilus 47 is rechargeable while firing.\n\n- When charging the weapon, it will take 38 frames in order to charge its first ring and 76 frames in total for a full charge.\n\n- With a single ring charged, it will have a firing duration of 52 frames. With a full charge, it will have a firing duration of 104 frames.\n\n- When charging with an empty tank, the charge time is multiplied by 5.\n\n- When firing, it shoots a bullet every 4 frames.\n\n- When firing, the player's movement speed is set to 0.7 units per frame.\nWhen charging, the player's movement speed is set to 0.4 units per frame.\n\n- When charging, the player's movement speed is set to 0.4 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 40 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Each shot has a base damage of 32.\n\n- If a shot is in the air for more than 7 frames after being fired, it loses 2 damage per frame until it reaches 16 damage at frame 15.\n\n- Shots have a radius of 2 units.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while on the ground is 3.3 degrees.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while in the air is 3.6 degrees.\n\n- The outer reticle immediately expands after jumping.

It sounds like a small detail, but let me assure you...it's huge! It means you can charge undetected until you're ready to leap out and splat an unsuspecting opponent. Of course, this state-of-the-art weapon has a few other tricks up its sleeve as well... It can be paused midshot to charge. It has a stabilizer to keep your aim steady while you jump. And it makes an inkredible grilled cheese! Oh, I may have dreamed the last one... Anyway, with the Point Sensor sub and Ink Storm special to help read opponent positions, this loadout can make you feel like you're playing in Cod Mode!\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Nautilus 47.\n\n- Unused early version of the Nautilus 47's Tableturf Battle card. The lights at the tip of the weapon are erroneously missing the Octoling's yellow color.\n\n- The Nautilus 47 is the only member of the splatling class to not have the word \"Splatling\" in its name.\n\n- The Nautilus 47 is one of the few weapons for which it is not apparent by its name that it is the first kit released for that weapon. Some other weapons that share this distinction are the Classic Squiffer, Dark Tetra Dualies, Snipewriter 5H, and the Mint Decavitator.\n\n- Due to releasing after it, the Nautilus 47, Ballpoint Splatling, Explosher, and Bloblobber are the only main weapons not included in the Octo Expansion.\n\nNautilus refers to weapon's resemblance to the shell of a mollusc of the same name and 47 is the atomic number of silver, referring to the weapon's silver coloration."
