    "The Nautilus 47 is a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3. It is a splatling-type weapon that can store its charge.",
    "The weapon is a relatively shorter ranged splatling weapon with a range in between the Mini Splatling and Heavy Splatling, with a charge time roughly the same as the Heavy Splatling and a firing time also in between the Mini Splatling and Heavy Splatling. Its main differentiation from other splatlings is its ability to hold full and partial charges up to 3â…“ seconds while swimming in ink, like the Goo Tuber. It also loses very little accuracy while jumping. Like the Ballpoint Splatling, the Nautilus 47 can recharge while firing.",
    "The Nautilus 47 has a consistent charge rate for both rings. It takes approximately 0.63 seconds to reach the first level of charge, and approximately 1.26 seconds in total to reach the second level of charge. Once the first level of charge is reached, it fires for 1 second, and once the second level of charge is reached, it fires for 2 seconds.",
    "The Nautilus 47 has three short barrels sticking out of a metal head piece. They are connected to a short metal body piece using three black tubes with stripes that change color to match the user's ink. The body piece also houses a handhold. The main part of the Nautilus 47 is a round metal shell bearing the Ammo Knights logo, which protects its inner workings. On the side of the shell that faces the user's body is a tight metal coil that disappears into the body piece, as well as a light pink block that stops up the entrance to the body piece. The block is slightly visible from the side facing away from the user's body, and it seems to have a handle sticking out of it that changes color to match the user's ink. Going across the block on the handle side is an oddly bent reddish-brown tube that goes into the body piece.",
    "The Nautilus 47's design appears to be visually based on a wickless alcohol Bunsen burner. It also, as the name suggests, seems to be based on a nautilus, with the body piece being the shell, the handle being the eye, and the barrels being the tentacles.",
    "The Nautilus 47 was released on 1 August 2018 at 00:00 UTC.[1] It comes with Point Sensors and the Baller.",
    "- While Main Power Up increases the number of shots fired, it does not increase the ink consumption relative to the amount charged, making the weapon comparatively more ink efficient.",

    "The Nautilus 47 returns in Splatoon 3 with Point Sensor and Ink Storm as its kit.",
    "It appears in three missions in Return of the Mammalians:",

    "- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Nautilus 47.",
    "- Unused early version of the Nautilus 47's Tableturf Battle card. The lights at the tip of the weapon are erroneously missing the Octoling's yellow color.",
    "- The Nautilus 47 is the only member of the splatling class to not have the word \"Splatling\" in its name.",
    "- The Nautilus 47 is one of the few weapons for which it is not apparent by its name that it is the first kit released for that weapon. Some other weapons that share this distinction are the Classic Squiffer, Dark Tetra Dualies, Snipewriter 5H, and the Mint Decavitator.",
    "- Due to releasing after it, the Nautilus 47, Ballpoint Splatling, Explosher, and Bloblobber are the only main weapons not included in the Octo Expansion.",
    "Nautilus refers to weapon's resemblance to the shell of a mollusc of the same name and 47 is the atomic number of silver, referring to the weapon's silver coloration."
