    "The Hero Splatling Replica is a main weapon in Splatoon 2.",
    "It is capable of firing bursts of ink with long range, low damage, and a fast fire rate. Although relatively slow to charge, each ink bullet does enough damage to splat opponents in four hits.",
    "The Hero Splatling Replica is identical in appearance to the Level 1 Hero Splatling. It is mainly silver with a yellow handle and yellow at the ends of the barrels.",
    "The Hero Splatling Replica is visually identical to the Level 1 Hero Splatling, but is simply a re-skinned Heavy Splatling. Therefore, unlike the switchable sub weapons of the Hero Splatling, it comes with Sprinklers and the Sting Ray. To unlock the Hero Splatling Replica, the player must complete every level with the Hero Splatling in Octo Canyon, at which point it becomes available for purchase at Ammo Knights.",
    "- While Main Power Up increases the number of shots fired, it does not increase the ink consumption relative to the amount charged, making the weapon comparatively more ink efficient.",

    "- The Hero Splatling Replica is used by the Inkling on the right",
    "For competitive tips about the Hero Splatling Replica",
    "Note: the strategy advice for Heavy Splatling also applies to Hero Splatling Replica, so they share the same strategy page.",
    "- The Hero Splatling and its replica closely resemble the design of the Heavy Splatling from Splatoon, as opposed to its redesign in Splatoon 2, most notably by the position of the ink tank.\nThe Hero Splatling, its replica, and the Heavy Splatling Remix are the only splatlings that retain the position of the ink tank from Splatoon. Notably, it was previously horizontal but changed to be positioned diagonally.",
    "Hero Splatling Replica is derived from the noun Hero, a portmanteau of Splat and Gatling, and the noun Replica.",
    "ヒーロースピナー レプリカ hīrō supinā repurika is derived from Spinner. The name Spinner is due to the fact that the barrels of the Hero Splatling Replica rotate while charging and firing."
