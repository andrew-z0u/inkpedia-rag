  "content": "The Hero Splatling Replica is a main weapon in Splatoon 2.\n\nIt is capable of firing bursts of ink with long range, low damage, and a fast fire rate. Although relatively slow to charge, each ink bullet does enough damage to splat opponents in four hits.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Splatoon 2\n\n2.1 Data\n2.2 Version history\n2.3 Quotes\n2.4 Gallery\n2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3 Strategy\n\n- 4 Trivia\n\n- 5 Etymology\n\n5.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 5.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 6 References\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 5.1 Names in other languages\n\nThe Hero Splatling Replica is identical in appearance to the Level 1 Hero Splatling. It is mainly silver with a yellow handle and yellow at the ends of the barrels.\n\nThe Hero Splatling Replica is visually identical to the Level 1 Hero Splatling, but is simply a re-skinned Heavy Splatling. Therefore, unlike the switchable sub weapons of the Hero Splatling, it comes with Sprinklers and the Sting Ray. To unlock the Hero Splatling Replica, the player must complete every level with the Hero Splatling in Octo Canyon, at which point it becomes available for purchase at Ammo Knights.\n\n- While Main Power Up increases the number of shots fired, it does not increase the ink consumption relative to the amount charged, making the weapon comparatively more ink efficient.\n\n- While Main Power Up increases the number of shots fired, it does not increase the ink consumption relative to the amount charged, making the weapon comparatively more ink efficient.\n\n- The Hero Splatling Replica is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 210. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The full charge ink consumption of 22.5% and ink tank capacity of 100% allows players to fully charge 4 times before needing to refill the ink tank.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- The Hero Splatling Replica cannot store its charge.\n\n- The Hero Splatling Replica is not rechargeable while firing.\n\n- When charging the weapon, it will take 50 frames in order to charge its first ring and 75 frames in total for a full charge.\n\n- With a single ring charged, it will have a firing duration of 72 frames. With a full charge, it will have a firing duration of 144 frames.\n\n- When charging with an empty tank, the charge time is multiplied by 4.\n\n- When firing, it shoots a bullet every 4 frames.\n\n- When firing, the player's movement speed is set to 0.7 units per frame.\nWhen charging, the player's movement speed is set to 0.62 units per frame.\n\n- When charging, the player's movement speed is set to 0.62 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 40 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Each shot has a base damage of 30.\n\n- If a shot is in the air for more than 11 frames after being fired, it loses 1.875 damage per frame until it reaches 15 damage at frame 19.\n\n- Shots have a radius of 2 units.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while on the ground is 3.3 degrees.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while in the air is 7 degrees.\n\n- The outer reticle immediately expands after jumping. After 25 frames, the outer reticle will start shrinking, and will finish shrinking after 70 frames.\n\n- The Hero Splatling Replica has a 30% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle.\n\n- When jumping, the chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle is immediately set to 30%.\n\n- Within the first charge ring, initial shot velocity scales from 10.5 to 21 units per frame. Within the second charge ring, initial shot velocity is always 21 units per frame. Shots travel straight at the initial velocity for 8 frames.\nSo at maximum charge, shots travel straight at a rate of 21 units per frame for 8 frames. Shots travel straight for 168 distance units.\n\n- So at maximum charge, shots travel straight at a rate of 21 units per frame for 8 frames. Shots travel straight for 168 distance units.\n\n- After shots stop flying straight, the velocity is set to 15.105 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and decreases further as it travels.\n\n- Ink droplets occur every 200 units.\n\n- The frequency at which ink drips from a shot occurs at a rate of 1 droplets per shot.\n\n- There are a total of 8 different droplet patterns that can be created while firing this weapon.\n\n- Droplets that occur within 11 units of the player have a radius of 18 units, and a width of 0 units.\nThese droplets have their radius multiplied by a value ranging from 1.6 if they fell from a height above 100 units to 1.28 if they fell from a height below 30 units.\n\n- These droplets have their radius multiplied by a value ranging from 1.6 if they fell from a height above 100 units to 1.28 if they fell from a height below 30 units.\n\n- Droplets that occur when they travel past 200 units of the player have a radius of 17 units.\n\n- All other ink droplets have a radius of 12.6 units.\n\n- Droplets that are far from the player and all other droplets have their radius multiplied by a value ranging from 1.6 if they fell from a height above 100 units to 1.6 if they fell from a height below 30 units.\n\n- If no ink droplets have occurred within 11 units of the player for 0 shots, the next shot the player makes will force a paint droplet to appear at the player's feet.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- When charging, the player's movement speed is set to 0.62 units per frame.\n\n- So at maximum charge, shots travel straight at a rate of 21 units per frame for 8 frames. Shots travel straight for 168 distance units.\n\n- These droplets have their radius multiplied by a value ranging from 1.6 if they fell from a height above 100 units to 1.28 if they fell from a height below 30 units.\n\n[1]\n\n- ▲ Increased movement speed while charging by 20%: 0.5 units/frame → 0.6 units/frame.\n\n- ▲ Increased movement speed while shooting by 3%: 0.64 units/frame → 0.66 units/frame.\n\n- ▲ Shot damage: 28.0 → 32.0.\nMinimum damage: 14.0 → 16.0.\n\n- Minimum damage: 14.0 → 16.0.\n\n- Minimum damage: 14.0 → 16.0.\n\n- ▼ Points to fill special gauge: 180 → 200.\n\n- ▲ Increased the effect of the Run Speed Up gear ability: 30% → 35%.\n\n- ▲ Increased movement speed while charging by 3%: 0.6 units/frame → 0.62 units/frame.\n\n- ▲ Increased movement speed while shooting by 6%: 0.66 units/frame → 0.7 units/frame.\n\n- ▲ Increased radius of ink around your feet by 7%.\n\n- ▼ Damage decreased: 32.0 → 30.0.\nMinimum damage: 16.0 → 15.0.\n\n- Minimum damage: 16.0 → 15.0.\n\n- Minimum damage: 16.0 → 15.0.\n\n- ▲ Decreased variance of shot spread when firing while on the ground by roughly 6%: 3.5 degrees → 3.3 degrees.\n\nThe Hero Splatling Replica is a custom design of the standard Heavy Splatling model with the same stats and setup. I'd been carrying out extensive tests and had finally created a weapon with stats worthy of something truly legendary... Sadly, I couldn't get approval for mass production as the guys down there couldn't wrap their heads around my advanced schematics... So I slapped some leftover parts on a Heavy Splatling and here we are! Looks pretty awesome, huh?\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- Hero weapons with the Hero Splatling Replica in the middle right\n\n- The Hero Splatling Replica is used by the Inkling on the right\n\n- An Inkling firing the Hero Splatling Replica in Humpback Pump Track. Note the appearance is similar to the first game's Heavy Splatling but yellow, and with blue lights.\n\nFor competitive tips about the Hero Splatling Replica\n\nNote: the strategy advice for Heavy Splatling also applies to Hero Splatling Replica, so they share the same strategy page.\n\n- The Hero Splatling and its replica closely resemble the design of the Heavy Splatling from Splatoon, as opposed to its redesign in Splatoon 2, most notably by the position of the ink tank.\nThe Hero Splatling, its replica, and the Heavy Splatling Remix are the only splatlings that retain the position of the ink tank from Splatoon. Notably, it was previously horizontal but changed to be positioned diagonally.\n\n- The Hero Splatling, its replica, and the Heavy Splatling Remix are the only splatlings that retain the position of the ink tank from Splatoon.

Notably, it was previously horizontal but changed to be positioned diagonally.\n\nHero Splatling Replica is derived from the noun Hero, a portmanteau of Splat and Gatling, and the noun Replica.\n\nヒーロースピナー レプリカ hīrō supinā repurika is derived from Spinner. The name Spinner is due to the fact that the barrels of the Hero Splatling Replica rotate while charging and firing."
