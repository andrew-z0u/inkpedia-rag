    "The Heavy Splatling is a main weapon in the Splatoon series, produced by Deco.",
    "It is capable of firing bursts of ink with long range, low damage, and a fast fire rate. Although relatively slow to charge, each ink bullet does enough damage to splat opponents in four hits.",
    "The Heavy Splatling varies in appearance between games. In Splatoon, the Heavy Splatling consists of multiple black barrels with orange supports connected to a large water jug that changes color to match the user's ink. In Splatoon 2, the barrels are less blocky, the supports are yellow, and the water jug is at a diagonal angle instead of being completely horizontal. In Splatoon 3, the supports are pink and gray, and a support was added to the water jug.",
    "The Heavy Splatling was made available with the 2.0.0 update on 6 August 2015 at 02:00 UTC.[1] Its set consists of Splash Wall and Inkstrike.",
