  "content": "The Heavy Splatling is a main weapon in the Splatoon series, produced by Deco.\n\nIt is capable of firing bursts of ink with long range, low damage, and a fast fire rate. Although relatively slow to charge, each ink bullet does enough damage to splat opponents in four hits.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Splatoon\n\n2.1 Data\n2.2 Version history\n2.3 Quotes\n2.4 Gallery\n2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3 Splatoon 2\n\n3.1 Data\n3.2 Version history\n3.3 Quotes\n3.4 Gallery\n3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 4 Splatoon 3\n\n4.1 Data\n4.2 Version history\n4.3 Quotes\n4.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n4.5 Gallery\n\n- 4.1 Data\n\n- 4.2 Version history\n\n- 4.3 Quotes\n\n- 4.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 4.5 Gallery\n\n- 5 Strategy\n\n- 6 Trivia\n\n- 7 Etymology\n\n7.1 Names in other languages\n7.2 Translation notes\n\n- 7.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 7.2 Translation notes\n\n- 8 References\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 4.1 Data\n\n- 4.2 Version history\n\n- 4.3 Quotes\n\n- 4.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 4.5 Gallery\n\n- 7.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 7.2 Translation notes\n\nThe Heavy Splatling varies in appearance between games. In Splatoon, the Heavy Splatling consists of multiple black barrels with orange supports connected to a large water jug that changes color to match the user's ink. In Splatoon 2, the barrels are less blocky, the supports are yellow, and the water jug is at a diagonal angle instead of being completely horizontal. In Splatoon 3, the supports are pink and gray, and a support was added to the water jug.\n\nThe Heavy Splatling was made available with the 2.0.0 update on 6 August 2015 at 02:00 UTC.[1] Its set consists of Splash Wall and Inkstrike.\n\n- The Heavy Splatling is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- A full charge consumes 22.5% of the ink tank capacity.\nThis allows players to fully charge 4 times before needing to refill the ink tank.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This allows players to fully charge 4 times before needing to refill the ink tank.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- The Heavy Splatling cannot store its charge.\n\n- The Heavy Splatling is not rechargeable while firing.\n\n- When charging the weapon, it will take 50 frames in order to charge its first ring and 75 frames in total for a full charge.\n\n- With a single ring charged, it will have a firing duration of 72 frames. With a full charge, it will have a firing duration of 144 frames.\n\n- When charging with an empty tank, the charge time is multiplied by 4.\n\n- When firing, it shoots a bullet every 4 frames.\n\n- When firing, the player's movement speed is set to 0.7 units per frame.\nWhen charging, the player's movement speed is set to 0.55 units per frame.\n\n- When charging, the player's movement speed is set to 0.55 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 40 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Each shot has a base damage of 28.\n\n- This allows players to fully charge 4 times before needing to refill the ink tank.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- When charging, the player's movement speed is set to 0.55 units per frame.\n\n- Shots travel straight for 8 frames. After that, they may lose damage.\n\n- Shots have a radius of 2 units.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while on the ground is 3.5 degrees.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while in the air is 7 degrees.\n\n- The outer reticle immediately expands after jumping. The outer reticle will finish shrinking after 45 frames.\n\n- The chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle increases by 2% per shot, and maximizes at a 30% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle.\nThis means that it takes 15 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- This means that it takes 15 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- When jumping, the chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle is immediately set to 30%.\n\n- Accuracy starts recovering 4 frames after the player stops shooting.\n\n- Within the first charge ring, initial shot velocity scales from 10.5 to 21 units per frame. Within the second charge ring, initial shot velocity is always 21 units per frame. Shots travel straight at the initial velocity for 8 frames. At maximum charge, shots travel straight for 168 distance units.\n\n- Ink droplets occur every 200 units.\n\n- The frequency at which ink drips from a shot occurs at a rate of 1 droplets per shot.\n\n- There are a total of 8 different droplet patterns that can be created while firing this weapon.\n\n- Droplets that occur within 11 units of the player have a radius of 19.2 units.\n\n- Droplets that occur when they travel past 200 units of the player have a radius of 18 units.\n\n- All other ink droplets have a radius of 14 units.\n\n- This means that it takes 15 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n[2]\n\n- ▲ Ink usage decreased by about 10%.\n\n- ▲ Special gauge loss: 50% → 40%.\n\nThe Heavy Splatling is kind of similar to a charger, but it belongs to a whole new weapon class! Hold  to pressurize the ink, and then release it to splatterize your foes like DAKKADAKKADAKKADAKKA!! But it uses a lot of ink and takes a while to charge, so this weapon can leave you exposed. Using the Splash Wall to impede your foes before unleashing an Inkstrike can be rather effective!(NA)\n\n- Promotional render\n\n- A roller user being targeted by a Heavy Splatling.\n\n- A Heavy Splatling firing.

Within the second charge ring, initial shot velocity is always 21 units per frame. Shots travel straight at the initial velocity for 8 frames.\nSo at maximum charge, shots travel straight at a rate of 21 units per frame for 8 frames. Shots travel straight for 168 distance units.\n\n- So at maximum charge, shots travel straight at a rate of 21 units per frame for 8 frames.

Hold down  to compress your ink, and then release  to unleash a fat stream of ink! Each charge uses a huge amount of ink, and charging it leaves you exposed for a while. If you use the Sprinkler well, you can keep a route open as you prepare to deal a death blow with the Sting Ray!

Hold down  to compress your ink, and then release  to unleash a monster stream! Now, as you might expect, each charge takes a while to get ready and uses a huge amount of ink, leaving you wide-open while you wait. That's why the Sprinkler is a great sub weapon here. It'll help your turf stay inked and keep a little distance between you and your enemies. The pro move is to fire up your Wave Breaker to expose enemy locations while the Heavy Splatling charges up. Then it's open season from way downtown! With power like this, even enemies with chargers will be jelly!\n\n- A promotional render\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- Tableturf Battle card art\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Heavy_Splatling_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nModel of the Heavy Splatling rotating (link to file)\n\nFor competitive tips about the Heavy Splatling\n\n- In Splatoon\nThe Heavy Splatling was first revealed when Splatoon was datamined on 21 June 2015.\nThe Slosher and Heavy Splatling were the first entirely new weapons added into the Splatoon franchise.
