It is a Splatling with the highest rate of fire in its class, provided it is fully charged.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Splatoon 3\n\n2.1 Data\n2.2 Version history\n2.3 Quotes\n2.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n2.5 Gallery\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 2.5 Gallery\n\n- 3 Strategy\n\n- 4 Trivia\n\n- 5 Etymology\n\n5.1 Names in other languages\n5.2 Translation notes\n\n- 5.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 5.2 Translation notes\n\n- 6 References\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 2.5 Gallery\n\n- 5.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 5.2 Translation notes\n\nThe Heavy Edit Splatling resembles an enlarged Soft Pen, sold by Platinum Pen in Japan, with barrels that look like pen tips and a kind of ink tube inside a clear cover. The grip is silver, with a red trigger, while the frame in the middle of the weapon, attached at the sides and protruding from the bottom as if to support the weapon, serves as the handgrip. It features a unique logo resembling a fish with a cross inside visible on the rear of the weapon and on the ammo box.\n\nAs for the Soft Pen's inspiration:\n\n- The firing nozzles resemble the replaceable pen tips of the Soft Pen.\n\n- Its ink cartridges resemble the replaceable ink cartridges of the Soft Pen, down to having golden markings printed on them.\n\n- The transparent casing resembles the see-through version of the Soft Pen.[1]\n\n- The rear part of the Heavy Edit Splatling resembles the cap of an older design of the Soft Pen, with the black plastic clip on the top and the red bit at the end.\n\nThe ink cartridges each have the Nouveau logo and are fed into the Heavy Edit Splatling from a white semi-translucent ammo box on its side via a white belt, which is similar to the belt feeder of some real-world firearms. Uniquely among main weapons, empty cartridges are depicted being ejected while firing, but this is only an aesthetic detail and they quickly disappear.\n\nThe Heavy Edit Splatling was revealed in the Drizzle Season 2023 trailer on 17 August 2023 and was released on 1 September 2023 at 00:00 UTC. It comes in a set with Curling Bombs and the Tacticooler.\n\n- The Heavy Edit Splatling is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 17. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The full charge ink consumption is 20%, allowing the user to fully charge 5 times on a full ink tank.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- The Heavy Edit Splatling cannot store its charge.\n\n- It takes 60 frames to charge the first circle (1 seconds) and 120 frames to fully charge (2 seconds).\nWhen airborne or low on ink, it takes 180 frames to charge the first circle (3 seconds) and 360 frames to fully charge (6 seconds).\n\n- When airborne or low on ink, it takes 180 frames to charge the first circle (3 seconds) and 360 frames to fully charge (6 seconds).\n\n- The Heavy Edit Splatling is not rechargeable while firing.\n\n- When charged to the first circle, the weapon will fire for 120 frames (2 seconds). When charged to the second circle, the weapon will fire for 240 frames (4 seconds). When fully charged, the weapon will fire for 180 frames (3 seconds).\nThe firing duration is 2 times longer than the charging duration when charged to the first circle, 2 times longer when charged to the second circle, and 1.5 times longer when fully charged.\n\n- The firing duration is 2 times longer than the charging duration when charged to the first circle, 2 times longer when charged to the second circle, and 1.5 times longer when fully charged.\n\n- When releasing a partial charge, it shoots a bullet every 4 frames (15 shots per second). When releasing a full charge, it shoots a bullet every 3 frames (20 shots per second).\n\n- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.086 units per frame.\nWhen charging, the player's movement speed is set to 0.072 units per frame.\n\n- When charging, the player's movement speed is set to 0.072 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 40 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Each shot has a base damage of 26, regardless of charge level.\nEach shot has a minimum damage of 13.\n\n- Each shot has a minimum damage of 13.\n\n- If a shot is in the air for more than 11 frames after being fired, it will lose about 1.63 damage every frame until it reaches 13 damage at frame 19.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with players has a radius of 0.2 units.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with the environment has a radius of 0.2 units.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while on the ground is 3.0 degrees.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while in the air is 6.0 degrees.\n\n- The Heavy Edit Splatling has a 30% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle.\n\n- The outer reticle immediately expands after jumping. After 25 frames, the outer reticle will start shrinking, and will finish shrinking after 70 frames.\n\n- When jumping, the chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle is immediately set to 30%.\n\n- Initial shot velocity scales with charge level. At minimum charge, it is 1.05 units per frame, and at once charge circle or more, it is 1.8 units per frame. Shots travel straight for 8 frames, regardless of charge level.\nAfter that, the shot's velocity is set to 1.105 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 1.105 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- Effective range scales from 9.98 units to 16.05 units, depending on charge level.\nThis number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n- This number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- When airborne or low on ink, it takes 180 frames to charge the first circle (3 seconds) and 360 frames to fully charge (6 seconds).\n\n- The firing duration is 2 times longer than the charging duration when charged to the first circle, 2 times longer when charged to the second circle, and 1.5 times longer when fully charged.\n\n- When charging, the player's movement speed is set to 0.072 units per frame.\n\n- Each shot has a minimum damage of 13.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 1.105 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- This number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n[2][3]\n\n- — Slightly adjusted the sounds the Heavy Edit Splatling makes while fully charged and while firing after being fully charged.\n\n- ▲ Increased the number of spray droplets created by shots.\nAverage far droplets per shot: 0.5 → 0.75.\nDistance between droplets: 30 units → 22 units.\nFrequency of inking occurring at the player's feet: 1/10 shots → 1/5 shots.\n\n- Average far droplets per shot: 0.5 → 0.75.\n\n- Distance between droplets: 30 units → 22 units.\n\n- Frequency of inking occurring at the player's feet: 1/10 shots → 1/5 shots.\n\n- Average far droplets per shot: 0.5 → 0.75.\n\n- Distance between droplets: 30 units → 22 units.\n\n- Frequency of inking occurring at the player's feet: 1/10 shots → 1/5 shots.\n\n- ▼ Points to fill special gauge: 190 → 200.\n\n- ▼ Slightly decreased the number of spray droplets created by shots.\nAverage far droplets per shot: 0.75 → 0.6.\nDistance between droplets: 22 units → 24 units.\nThe frequency of inking occurring at the player's feet is unchanged.\n\n- Average far droplets per shot: 0.75 → 0.6.\n\n- Distance between droplets: 22 units → 24 units.\n\n- The frequency of inking occurring at the player's feet is unchanged.\n\n- Average far droplets per shot: 0.75 → 0.6.\n\n- Distance between droplets: 22 units → 24 units.\n\n- The frequency of inking occurring at the player's feet is unchanged.\n\nThe Heavy Edit Splatling boasts the fastest fire rate of any splatling and—despite the name—a surprisingly lightweight feel, allowing you to move quickly and shoot quickly-er.\nOh, I wish I could edit what I just said as quickly as this weapon edits enemies out of the picture. No one shot hits particularly hard, but with this fire rate, it hardly matters!\nAnd speaking of speed, your Curling Bombs can put you on the glide path to victory, and the Tacticooler special can help you get there even sooner with a speed burst!\nYou don't need to read between the lines here. I'm saying this set is built for one thing—going fast. Why not buckle up and give it a try?\n\n- Promotional render\n\n- The Heavy Edit Splatling firing at the Gold Dynamo Roller, also showing the Nouveau logo on the ink-rounds in the tail end.\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Heavy Edit Splatling.\n\n- The logo on the rear of the weapon.\n\n- The ammo box of the weapon, with the ink cartridges.\n\n- Artwork of an Inkling holding the Heavy Edit Splatling\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Heavy_Edit_Splatling_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nModel of the Heavy Edit Splatling rotating (Link to file)\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Heavy_Edit_Splatling_demonstration.mp4\n\n\nThe Heavy Edit Splatling in action (Link to file)\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Heavy_Edit_Splatling_rear_close-up.mp4\n\n\nA close-up view of the Heavy Edit Splatling seen from behind while firing; the ink cartridges can be seen being fed into the weapon and then ejected once emptied. (Link to file)\n\nFor competitive tips about the Heavy Edit Splatling\n\n- The Heavy Edit Splatling is not included in Return of the Mammalians due to it being added post-release.\n\n- The Heavy Edit Splatling and its variant, the Heavy Edit Splatling Nouveau, are the only weapons to have a base damage of 26.0 after Version 2.2.0 released in Splatoon.\n\n- The Heavy Edit Splatling shares some commonalities with the Hydra Splatling: a special function if the weapon is fully charged, a high damage per second (respectively the highest in the game, with the Hydra Splatling at number one), a long charge time, the colors of the weapons across all variants, and even their internal names, which are particularly similar.\n\nHeavy Edit Splatling is a combination of \"heavy edit\", a term used to describe a very drastic change, and \"splatling\", for the weapon class."
