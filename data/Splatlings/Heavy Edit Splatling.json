    "Not to be confused with Heavy Splatling.",
    "The Heavy Edit Splatling is a main weapon first introduced in Splatoon 3, produced by Nouveau. It is a Splatling with the highest rate of fire in its class, provided it is fully charged.",
    "The Heavy Edit Splatling resembles an enlarged Soft Pen, sold by Platinum Pen in Japan, with barrels that look like pen tips and a kind of ink tube inside a clear cover. The grip is silver, with a red trigger, while the frame in the middle of the weapon, attached at the sides and protruding from the bottom as if to support the weapon, serves as the handgrip. It features a unique logo resembling a fish with a cross inside visible on the rear of the weapon and on the ammo box.",
    "As for the Soft Pen's inspiration:",
    "- The firing nozzles resemble the replaceable pen tips of the Soft Pen.",
    "- Its ink cartridges resemble the replaceable ink cartridges of the Soft Pen, down to having golden markings printed on them.",
    "- The transparent casing resembles the see-through version of the Soft Pen.[1]",
    "- The rear part of the Heavy Edit Splatling resembles the cap of an older design of the Soft Pen, with the black plastic clip on the top and the red bit at the end.",
    "The ink cartridges each have the Nouveau logo and are fed into the Heavy Edit Splatling from a white semi-translucent ammo box on its side via a white belt, which is similar to the belt feeder of some real-world firearms. Uniquely among main weapons, empty cartridges are depicted being ejected while firing, but this is only an aesthetic detail and they quickly disappear.",
    "The Heavy Edit Splatling was revealed in the Drizzle Season 2023 trailer on 17 August 2023 and was released on 1 September 2023 at 00:00 UTC. It comes in a set with Curling Bombs and the Tacticooler.",

    "For competitive tips about the Heavy Edit Splatling",
    "- The Heavy Edit Splatling is not included in Return of the Mammalians due to it being added post-release.",
    "- The Heavy Edit Splatling and its variant, the Heavy Edit Splatling Nouveau, are the only weapons to have a base damage of 26.0 after Version 2.2.0 released in Splatoon.",
    "- The Heavy Edit Splatling shares some commonalities with the Hydra Splatling: a special function if the weapon is fully charged, a high damage per second (respectively the highest in the game, with the Hydra Splatling at number one), a long charge time, the colors of the weapons across all variants, and even their internal names, which are particularly similar.",
    "Heavy Edit Splatling is a combination of \"heavy edit\", a term used to describe a very drastic change, and \"splatling\", for the weapon class."
