It also includes more wide-open areas. There are numerous ways to attack the center of the map, as well as to attack the bases. In the center, there is a tall tower. It is a large, plateaued structure that can only be accessed by climbing vertical paths of ink. It is an effective but vulnerable place to control the center area of the stage. Small balconies are positioned on its sides. Right-angled alleys are located to the right of each team's spawn point and lead towards the center of the map. They each contain a high platform which can be useful for chargers trying to take over the central tower. There are no hazards in Blackbelly Skatepark.\n\nIn Splatoon 2, the spawn point area is not accessible to the enemy team, now being on a fairly large raised platform area.\n\nIn Ranked Battles, specifications for the terrain or placement of objects are different between the modes; these changes create new paths or new objects to take cover behind.\n\nThe Splat Zones in Blackbelly Skatepark are relatively small and located in opposite corners from each other in the middle of the map, both touching the central tower. The spawn points are moved down a layer and the layer which the spawn points were in Turf War is removed. Inkrails are also added to get to the center quicker.\n\nThe Tower in Blackbelly Skatepark is located at the top of the central tower. The goals are located in the right alleys, going past the two small walls. When it is ridden, the Tower moves to the riding team's left. It then descends downward and proceeds to go through the opposing team's right alley, all the way to the goal. The spawn points are moved down a layer and the layer which the spawn points were in Turf War is removed. Inkrails are also added to get to the center and the tower quicker.\n\nThe Rainmaker in Blackbelly Skatepark is located at the top of the central tower. The goals are located directly to the left, just off of the spawn point. Just past those goals, right by the central tower, there are black uninkable boxes. There are also small boxes added to the central tower so players can hit the Rainmaker without being pushed down from the expanding shield.\n\nIn Splatoon 2, the central tower is significantly shorter with the Rainmaker on it. The goal is on the layer below the spawn point and a block has been added to jump to the layer below the spawn point. Going to the right also allows a way to the pedestal. While to the left also provides a way to the pedestal. Rainmaker is the only ranked mode in which this stage retains most of the terrain of Turf War.\n\nThe basket is located at the right side from the spawn, in front of the hills. There are no bumps near it. The spawn points are moved down a layer and the layer which the spawn points were in Turf War is removed. An Inkrail has been added to get to the basket quicker. The layout looks the same as in Tower Control.\n\nBlackbelly Skatepark underwent a series of changes between its development period and release.\n\nThe pre-release version included many differences, such as:\n\n- Stairs leading from spawn points to the central tower were present.\n\n- There were more wooden ramps near the middle area.\n\n- Near the middle area, four bumpers could be found.\n\n- The entrance to the middle of the map from the left of both teams' spawn points were not present.\n\n- The pre-release version of Blackbelly Skatepark.\n\n- A battle at the pre-release version of Blackbelly Skatepark.\n\n- Another shot of a pre-release Blackbelly Skatepark. The outer city and barriers are different.\n\n- An Inkling flinging ink with the Dynamo Roller at an early version of Blackbelly Skatepark.\n\n- An Inkling firing the Rapid Blaster at an early version of Blackbelly Skatepark.\n\n- An Inkling running with the Splat Charger at an early version of Blackbelly Skatepark.\n\nBlackbelly Skatepark was released with the launch of Splatoon.\n\n- Turf War\n\n- Splat Zones\n\n- Tower Control\n\n- Rainmaker\n\n- A male Inkling pushing an Inkbrush at Blackbelly Skatepark.\n\n- Inklings playing Tower Control at Blackbelly Skatepark.\n\n- A female Inkling holding a Splat Charger on the central tower.\n\n- An Inkling Super Jumping over Blackbelly Skatepark as a Kraken.\n\n- The park outside of Blackbelly Skatepark.\n\n- The city buildings behind Blackbelly Skatepark.\n\n- Blackbelly Skatepark during a Splatfest.\n\n- Top-down view of Blackbelly Skatepark during a Splatfest.\n\n- The view of Inkopolis from Blackbelly Skatepark during a Splatfest.\n\n- Basketball courts outside Blackbelly Skatepark.\n\n- Overhead view of Blackbelly Skatepark.\n\n- The center platform.\n\n- The Splat Zones on Blackbelly Skatepark.\n\n- An Inkling girl firing the .96 Gal Deco at Blackbelly Skatepark.\n\nBlackbelly Skatepark was available in the following Splatfests in Splatoon:\n\n- Lemon Tea vs. Milk Tea\n\n- Marshmallows vs. Hot Dogs\n\n- Singing vs. Dancing\n\n- Cars vs. Planes\n\n- Love vs. Money\n\n- Zombies vs. Ghosts\n\n- Pokémon Red vs. Pokémon Blue (NA/EU/OC)\n\n- Show No Mercy! vs. Focus on Healing\n\n- Chocorooms vs. Chococones\n\nBlackbelly Skatepark was released on 28 October 2017 at 02:00 UTC.[1]\n\nBlackbelly Skatepark returns in Splatoon 2, initially appearing nearly identical to its appearance in Splatoon, with a few notable changes. The platform the spawn point is located on no longer slopes downwards to the area ahead of it, and the platform has been stretched backwards to allow for more room. The square platform in front of the spawn now also extends forwards, allowing for an additional side route to the center. A small bump on the right side of the stage also has been removed. As a result of these changes, the stage is now larger and more open than its appearance in the first game.\n\nOn 29 November 2018, an announcement was posted on the official Splatoon Japanese Twitter account stating that from 1 December 2018 until the release of version 4.3.0 on 5 December 2018, Blackbelly Skatepark would be \"closed for renovations\", similar to the announcements made for Starfish Mainstage in version 4.0.0 and The Reef in version 4.2.0.[2] The announcement included a blueprint of the stage with the planned changes scribbled on it.\n\nChanges included:\n\n- Areas around the teams' spawn points were significantly deepened and widened.\n\n- One of the L-shaped platforms on the left side of each team's spawn was slightly widened.\n\n- Fixed an issue on Blackbelly Skatepark in which players could jump higher than normal near the start point and go over certain obstacles.\n\n- Fixed an issue on Blackbelly Skatepark in which if a certain wall was hit with a bomb, ink would splash onto a nearby wall that players were occasionally unable to submerge into.\n\n- Fixed an issue in Tower Control on Blackbelly Skatepark in which players could climb over a wall not intended to be climbed over by jumping from the top of a tower at the right moment.\n\n- Fixed an issue in Blackbelly Skatepark during Rainmaker matches allowing players to make their way deep into enemy turf by making the side of a crate in a player's turf uninkable, then making use of the side of the crate.\n\n- Fixed an issue in Blackbelly Skatepark during Rainmaker matches allowing players to make their way deep into enemy turf from above the goal.\n\n- Changes made to terrain in all modes.\nChanged terrain around the spawn points.\nChanged the placement of existing obstacles and added new ones.\n\n- Changed terrain around the spawn points.\n\n- Changed the placement of existing obstacles and added new ones.\n\n- Changed terrain around the spawn points.\n\n- Changed the placement of existing obstacles and added new ones.\n\n- Fixed a problem where Ink Mines placed on a specific part of a slope in Rainmaker would detonate immediately.\n\n- Fixed an issue during certain modes, allowing players to cross over certain barriers to gain access to the area around the opponent's spawn point.\n\n- Turf War\n\n- Splat Zones\n\n- Tower Control\n\n- Rainmaker\n\n- Clam Blitz\n\n- Turf War\n\n- Splat Zones\n\n- Tower Control\n\n- Rainmaker\n\n- Clam Blitz\n\n- Inklings on the middle tower (a reference to Splatoon's mascot Inklings).\n\n- A female Inkling standing in front of stickers of gear brands on the walls.\n\n- An Inkbrush flinging ink from the center tower.\n\n- v4.3 Blackbelly Skatepark during a Splatfest.\n\n- Turf War (Splatfest) icon for Blackbelly Skatepark.\n\n- Blackbelly Skatepark during the FrostyFest.\n\n- An example of in-universe street art.\n\n- Blackbelly Skatepark's name is a reference to the real-life blackbelly skate, a species of ray.\n\n- Evening and night variants of this stage are used in Octo Valley in the missions Octoling Assault and Unavoidable Flying Object, respectively, with the night version also appearing during Splatfests.\n\n- A bridge resembling the Sydney Harbour Bridge can be seen in the background.\n\n- This stage and Bluefin Depot are the only stages that have been used in both Octoling and Octostriker missions.\n\n- As seen from the UFO at the end of Unavoidable Flying Object and by Super Jumping, there are basketball courts near Blackbelly Skatepark.\n\n- This is the smallest stage in Splatoon, but in Splatoon 2, it is the fifth largest, not counting any Shifty Station layouts.\n\nBlackbelly Skatepark is named after a real-life species of ray called the \"blackbelly skate\".\n\nBバスパーク B Basu Pāku is short for \"black bass park\".\n\n- Blackbelly Skatepark on StrategyWiki"
