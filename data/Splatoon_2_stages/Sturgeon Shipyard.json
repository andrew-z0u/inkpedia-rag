    "Sturgeon Shipyard is a multiplayer stage in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3. The entire stage is a ship being built inside a shipyard. Drawbridges around the stage are periodically raised and lowered, modifying the players' navigation options. It is one of the stages that can have Tricolor Turf Wars.",
    "Sturgeon Shipyard contains many low areas surrounded by high perches, featuring a few bridges which open and close between a vertical and horizontal position during a battle. Sturgeon Shipyard has four platforms that rise and fall throughout a match, starting in an upright position. Two are located immediately in front of the spawn point and two are located at opposing ends of the central area. The position of these platforms can create different advantages throughout a match, such as the central ones allowing access to the opponent's vantage point. They are closer to each team's base, which is comprised of two layers. To reach the opposing team's spawn, one must travel across the entirety of the middle level from right to left.",
    "Going from the spawn point, there is a small hallway to the left which drops off in a lower area to the side of the stage. The exterior of the center of the stage contains raised areas overlooking the central bridge in the center. There is also a small grated area underneath the central bridge with a bumper in the middle.",
    "In Splatoon 3 Sturgeon Shipyard received few changes. A new large spawn platform was added at the very back corner of each team's spawn region and many walls around the spawn region were removed. The ramp leading deeper into the opponent's spawn was also made wider. The grates on the left of each team's snipe were extended slightly, making it possible to jump from there to the raised platform in front of it.",
    "In Ranked Battles, specifications for the terrain or placement of objects are different between the modes; these changes create new paths or new objects to take cover behind.",
    "The zone covers the center bridge and the ramps leading up to it. Two new blocks facing perpendicular to the zone's length are added to help control the zone easier. Other than that, no changes have been made in this mode.",
    "The Tower is located on top of the center bridge. When taking the Tower, it travels right, then moves down towards enemy territory. It then continues to move up the ramp and into the middle layer, where it reaches its goal halfway through the area. Spawn points have been moved to a raised area to create distance between the spawn and the goal. A ramp is added left of spawn, as well as an inkable wall and block, and the sponge has been switched out for a sponge of the opposing team's color, making it easier to get into enemy territory.",
    "In Splatoon 3 the general path of the tower remains the same but the terrain around the goal has changed. The area around it has been widened slightly and the uninkable ramp has been changed to be inkable. The inkable wall has been moved to the other side and the ramp leading deeper into the opponent's side has been removed, making going to the opponent's spawn harder.",
    "The Rainmaker is located in the center of the stage, on top of the bridge. The goals are near where the spawn points normally sit, closer to the ramps, with the spawn point now on a new platform further back. The map is the same as Tower Control but has an extra ramp near spawn and a new inkable block that allows access to the area of the drawbridges near spawn and creates a new route to the left.",
    "In Splatoon 3 the Rainmaker layout was majorly changed. The left route now has a small grate platform making jumping to it easier and the block was removed to make way for the checkpoint. The left side was made shorter meaning the only way to progress through this route is when the drawbridge is down. Another checkpoint is found in the middle of each team's courtyard, before the ramp. The ramp was changed to inkable and the area around it was expanded like in Tower Control. The added ramp leading up to the pedestal was replaced with an inkable block for a jump, making that route harder. The sponge of the opposing team's color was removed.",
    "The baskets are located in the bottom section of each base, against the middle of the wall away from the center of the stage, with the bump on the ground next to the ramp leading up. The layout is the same as Tower Control, minus the ramps, the block near the ramp, and removing the sponge entirely.",
    "Sturgeon Shipyard was released with the launch of Splatoon 2.",
    "Sturgeon Shipyard was revealed to return in Splatoon 3 during the Splatoon 3 Direct shown on 10 August 2022. The stage was available at launch. The central section of the stage remains entirely unchanged, however, the spawn area is an extra platform for the spawners to send players to, above where the spawn points were located in Splatoon 2. During certain ranked modes, the moving platforms move depending on the location of the objective. It is also one of the stages that can have Tricolor Turf Wars, in which the spawn areas have been largely decreased and two extra areas are added on each side of the center, for the defending team to spawn in.",
    "Sturgeon Shipyard was available in the following Splatfests as a Tricolor Turf War stage in Splatoon 3:",
    "Sturgeon Shipyard is a reference to the family Acipenseridae, known as sturgeon fish.",

To do this, the player must go into the moving wall in the middle, then place a Beakon in the moving wall near the small stack of blocks in the middle. Once the wall goes vertical, go into the top of the small block and place a Beakon in the same place.",
