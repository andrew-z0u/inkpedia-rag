The spawn points are located on elevated platforms that protrude outwards, allowing players to access the right side of the stage easily. Immediately in front, there is a small flat area before the canal descends to the lower point. Players can, however, take a corridor to the left which gets them to the other side of a wall and the other side of the slope. To the far sides of the stage, the lowest flat areas can be found with some obstacles and a ramp only accessible from the lower area. The center of the stage has a large lone barricade. The wall can be inked but the top of it is uninkable.\n\nIn Ranked Battles, specifications for the terrain or placement of objects are different between the modes; these changes create new paths or new objects to take cover behind.\n\nThe Splat Zone is located at the very center of the stage, on the low area with the barricade. The stage is completely unchanged in this mode.\n\nThe Tower is located at the center of the stage in place of the barricade. The Tower retreats towards the riders' side and goes left before going forwards over the water, towards the enemy base, and reaches its final destination on the flat area at the top of the slope in front of their base. Spawns have slightly been pushed closer to the center of the map and the goal, Inkrails have been added in front of the spawn point to facilitate getting into the fight faster. Ramps and blocks have been added throughout the map to reach certain areas faster. The walls near the canal have been replaced with smaller walls, and a new block has been added next to the canal to make map control easier.\n\nThe Rainmaker is located on top of the barricade at the center of the stage. The goal is located where each team's spawn point would usually be, with ramps having been added to facilitate this. The spawn points have been moved one layer upon a newly added platform. Players can take a more direct approach to the area, can access some newly added inkable walls up the left side of the stage, or infiltrate from the right side.\n\nThe baskets are located in the flat area in front of the spawn. Spawns are moved to a higher level to create distance between the basket and spawn. An Inkrail that goes over the water canal has been added, designed to be another path to reach the opposing team's basket. Other than that, the layout has been unchanged.\n\nThe stage was released on 6 October 2017 at 14:00 UTC.[1][2][3]\n\n- Fixed an issue allowing the player to pass through the squid barrier surrounding the spawn points on Snapper Canal.\n\n- Fixed an issue on Snapper Canal allowing players to repeatedly cross over squid barriers near spawn points.\n\n- Fixed an issue on Snapper Canal causing players to walk faster on slopes inked in opponents' ink than originally designed.\n\n- Fixed an issue on Manta Maria and Snapper Canal where the \"DON'T RETREAT!\" warning in Rainmaker was not displaying when players returned to their spawn point.\n\n- Fixed an issue on Snapper Canal in which bombs would disappear without exploding when coming into contact with certain walls.\n\n- Fixed an issue on Snapper Canal in which, depending on the mode, the area beneath obstacles placed near the center was inkable, was counted as part of the turf, and couldn't be reclaimed in Splat Zones.\n\n- Outside of Splatfests, reduced brightness of the sun, and reduced the disparity in visibility between teams.\n\n- Fixed an issue on Snapper Canal in Turf War in which players could ink beneath certain obstacles and get points for it.\n\n- Changed terrain placement in Rainmaker.\nAdded a slope near the center.\nAdjusted placement near the spawn point.\n\n- Added a slope near the center.\n\n- Adjusted placement near the spawn point.\n\n- Changed terrain placement in Clam Blitz.\nAdded a slope near the center.\n\n- Added a slope near the center.\n\n- Added a slope near the center.\n\n- Adjusted placement near the spawn point.\n\n- Added a slope near the center.\n\n- Fixed an issue causing players to clip into stage terrain while climbing specific walls.\n\n- Turf War\n\n- Splat Zones\n\n- Tower Control\n\n- Rainmaker\n\n- Clam Blitz\n\n- Zoomed out view of Snapper Canal without any ink.\n\n- Promotional image of the stage from its initial reveal.\n\n- The previous image, without ink.\n\n- Another screenshot\n\n- Another screenshot\n\n- A shot similar to the previous image showcasing an example of in-universe street art.\n\n- Promotional image of the stage from its update announcement.\n\n- The stage's spawn point, as seen in a Nintendo Direct.\n\n- A screenshot of the stage with incomplete texture work, found in the game's data.\n\n- Some ducks found on the stage.\n\n- Snapper Canal during a Splatfest.\n\n- Turf War (Splatfest) icon for Snapper Canal.\n\n- In the stage's picture, default Inkling girls can be seen standing in the spawn.\n\n- Pearl said that her dad taught her how to ride a bike as a kid here, but according to Marina, she still uses training wheels.\n\n- It is implied that Snapper Canal was already under construction when Pearl was a child, and as such has been ongoing for a considerable period of time, still not finished by the time of Splatoon 2. News dialogue in various localizations further implies this is due to its continued usage as a battle stage.\n\n- Snapper Canal is one of four multiplayer stages to appear in the Octo Expansion, alongside Manta Maria, Port Mackerel, and Starfish Mainstage.\n\n- The stage and the bridge itself is inspired by the real life Los Angeles River.\n\n- This stage has a graffiti of Manta Maria on its jumps across the river.\n\nSnapper Canal is a reference to the family Lutjanidae, known as snapper fish."
