    "Camp Triggerfish is a multiplayer stage in Splatoon and Splatoon 2. Located in a heavily wooded area surrounded by a large mountain range, the stage takes place on two forts built over a lake, which are  connected by a few small paths. Certain gates are lowered in Turf War and Ranked modes, with the latter being lowered at the start of the match while the former will only descend in the final minute of a match.",
    "Camp Triggerfish consists of a series of bridges over water and a large area near the team's spawn point, along with a shelter that can only be accessed via a grated pathway in Turf War. Both bases at Camp Triggerfish have a set of floodgates that open and close periodically. When the gates are down, it is easier for other teams to enter.",
    "Teams begin on opposite sides of the stage with bases immediately splitting into two paths. The left path leads into a large, circular area surrounded partially by a net over water. This area extends into a narrow walkway ending in high, wooden walls. The path to the right of each team's base leads directly into the central walkways, which are also accessible by climbing over the aforementioned walls. This path leads into an open area below a series of net catwalks, which lead to the other team's base or the shelters behind their floodgates. The areas in front of the spawns are very large. Going left also leads to the backside of the walls of in the center of the stage. These areas allow players to reach the top of the wall. On both sides, there are three sections each where grates go over the water. Only the farthest of these allow the player to cross over to the other side.",
    "Camp Triggerfish features an ambiance of chirping birds and, when players are close to the lake, rippling water. Occasionally, parachuters can be seen in the sky. On the opposite side of the river Camp Triggerfish is built over, another part of the camp can be seen with jellyfish performing various activities such as using canoes, sitting by the lake or climbing on the fort. Upon spawning, the chirping of crickets can be briefly heard before fading.",
    "In Splatoon 2, the most notable change made is the change to the floodgates and area immediately behind them. Instead of having two floodgates, they have been replaced by a single wider gate and the area behind has been changed from a narrow corridor to an open square plaza. Two Inkrails have been added to each side of the map; one directly in front of the spawn point, and the other is behind the wall close to the center of the map which allows a quicker path to the left side.",
    "In Ranked Battles, specifications for the terrain or placement of objects are different between the modes; these changes create new paths or new objects to take cover behind.",
    "There are two Splat Zones located on opposite sides of the canal in the middle of the map. The blocks on top of the Splat Zones do not count towards taking control of one.",
    "The Tower starts in the center of the two center platforms on an added platform in between. When activated, the Tower travels over the water dividing the two sides, passing by the many grated areas on either side, until it climbs up the gated section, before ending in the middle of the wide pathway in front of the spawn point.",
    "In Splatoon 2, during Tower Control, an additional wooden path connects the area immediately in front of the spawn to the platform on the right. The Tower now goes right near the Inkrail and does not go into the floodgate area. Checkpoints have also been added for the Tower:",
    "The Rainmaker starts on top of an added platform in the center of the map, bridging the gap between the two sides. The goals are located on opposite corners of the map, inside the floodgate shelter on the side closest to the opposing team's spawn point. A stack of blocks and an inkable wall have been added, as well as a wooden platform added next to each of the teams' bases that connects the spawn points to their side of the goal. Two inkable blocks have also been added to the roped bridges.",
    "In Splatoon 2, the location of the Rainmaker remains the same. The pedestal has been moved closer to the middle of the floodgate shelter. The sponge is replaced with an inkable wall and the grate area next to the Inkrail now connects to the floodgate area, allowing another way to get to the pedestal. The area added to the right of spawn in Tower Control is present in Rainmaker.",
    "The goal is in front of the spawn point and a bump is present. A piece of terrain is present allowing for teams to get from their spawn point to the area that has the gate leading to the larger area. However, the Inkrail near the spawn point is still there. The sponge is replaced with an inkable wall and an uninkable staircase is on the other side of the inkable wall.",
    "Camp Triggerfish underwent a series of multiple changes between its development period and release.",
    "An early version of Camp Triggerfish appeared in many trailers for Splatoon. The pre-release version included many differences, such as:",
    "- The circular areas on the left of the teams' bases included much taller, independent cylinders to climb.",
    "- The short stacks of boxes on the central walkways were not present.",
    "- Many walls found throughout the final version are not present at all.\nThe walkway near the round area near both teams' spawns is not present because of this.",
    "- The walkways near the center were much closer to the water, lower than the area at the end of each side.",
    "- The roped bridge that leads from one side to the other was not present.",
    "- The grated platform closest to each teams' spawn extended farther out onto the water.",
    "- The wooden bridge next to both spawns was roped, allowing players to fall through it onto the solid ground below.",
    "- A pre-release version of Camp Triggerfish, inked in different colors.",
    "- A team of Inklings posing together in an older version of Camp Triggerfish.",
    "- A shot of an older Camp Triggerfish, showing metal barrels in the sea.",
    "- An Inkling splatting an enemy with the Splat Charger at an early version of Camp Triggerfish.",
    "A second early design for Camp Triggerfish can be seen in the stage's main image in Splatoon. While this design is much closer to the final version, there are still noticeable differences:",
    "- The wooden bridge next to the players' spawn is still roped, allowing players to slide through it. Additionally, it was placed higher than the wooden platform in the final game.",
    "- The wall separating the main pathway from the small area on the side of the stage was less tall.",
    "- The height of the cylindrical platforms to the left side of the stage were much taller and were fully inkable, with no bar preventing players from swimming directly over them. Additionally, they did not fully connect to the wall separating the side area from the main pathway.",
    "- Slanted platforms at the corners of the stage were initially completely flat.",
    "- The placement of Bumpers around the stage was heavily modified.",
    "- The grated platforms allowing teams to access the opponent's fort were lower than in the final version.",
    "- The decorative totem poles were shorter.",

    "- The Squid Sisters' conversation saying that \"apparently they've rebuilt this place tons of times\" and asking \"why not pick a design and THEN start building it?\" are likely a reference to the long development period of Camp Triggerfish.\nAccording to an Off the Hook conversation, Pearl was the designer of Camp Triggerfish and the stage is owned by her family, stating: \"Hey, did you know I designed this stage back in the day?\", to which Marina replies: \"Yup. Your parents own the place, right?\".\nIt is also stated that Pearl wrote the camp song that Marie mentions in the first game.",
    "- The Squid Sisters' conversations \"Ahh, a campsite! Did you bring the marshmallows?\", \"No, but I brought hot dogs!\" and \"Let's roast marshmallows over the campfire!\", \"Splat that!
