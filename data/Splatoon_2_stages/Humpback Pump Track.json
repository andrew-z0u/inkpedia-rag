    "Humpback Pump Track is a multiplayer stage in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3. The main terrain of Humpback Pump Track features an uneven bike track comprising the border of the inner area as well as a raised hump-shaped hill at the center of the stage.[1][2]",
    "The spawn points are located on inaccessible points of the stage which allow a fairly wide window to access the battleground. Following the track to the right leads to a drop-off and a raised ramp which allows players to attack from behind cover, and continuing to follow the track leads into the enemy's side. Following the track to the left accesses the opponent's primary access point to the other team's side.",
    "In Ranked Battles, specifications for the terrain or placement of objects are different between the modes; these changes create new paths or new objects to take cover behind.",
    "The Splat Zone is located at the center of the stage on top of the hump. Small blocks to the side of zone have been added to make the zone easier to control. Blocks to the side of the stage make access to the opposing team's side harder.",
    "The Tower is located at the center of the stage on top of the hump. The Tower moves at an angle, left down the hump before traveling through the alley, then going up into the enemy base where it reaches its goal. Blocks to the side of the stage make access to the opposing team's side harder. Inkrails have been added to get the tower quicker. A block has been added near the second checkpoint, and ramps have been added to connect the center hump to the bike track. Blocks have also been added near the walls right of spawn to provide a vantage point.",
    "The Rainmaker is located at the center of the stage on top of the hump. The goal is located at the far end of the opposing team's side, being located as far the opposing team can go. Humpback Pump Track offers two points of entry: going around from the right track, or going straight and then turning left to climb a newly added wall to the same layer of the pedestal. Inkrails have been added to make getting to the center of the stage faster. Blocks to the side of the stage make access to the opposing team's side harder.",
    "In Splatoon 3 the checkpoints are located to the far right and to the far left of the stage. The left wall has been removed and that area has been slightly extended, allowing players to jump to the area from the checkpoint. A sponge has been added near the pedestal.",
    "The basket on this stage is located at opposing ends of the central area, making access to the basket fairly easy. The layout in this mode is exactly the same as Rainmaker.",
    "Humpback Pump Track was released with the launch of Splatoon 2. A modified version of Humpback Pump Track appears in Octoling Assault, an Octo Canyon mission.",
