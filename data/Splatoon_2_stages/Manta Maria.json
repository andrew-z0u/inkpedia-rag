The areas closest to the spawn feature varying heights including steep drop-offs. Following the path to the right leads to an upper area that oversees the central band of the ship. Going straight from the spawn leads to a structure that can be climbed on to get a vantage on the central area and a hallway that leads to the lower portion of the central area. Distinguishing features of the stage include three large masts in each team's base and at the center of the stage which are accessible by netted walkways which overlook the stage. The key point of this stage is the offensive and defensive battle around the three huge masts and the area covered in netting. It is possible to get to the opponent's spawn area by swimming up a wall and jumping to the other side.\n\nIn Splatoon 3 the spawn areas have been slightly expanded, with a raised area added to the right of each team's spawn. An Inkrail is added to the right to allow easier access to the raised area. The alleys that go to the opponent's base are widened, being much bigger than in Splatoon 2. Players can also jump to a boat on the right of the stage when respawning.\n\nIn Ranked Battles, specifications for the terrain or placement of objects are different between the modes; these changes create new paths or new objects to take cover behind.\n\nManta Maria features two Splat Zones. The Splat Zones are located at parallel sides of the central area surrounding the mast. The layout has been unchanged from Turf War.\n\nThe Tower is located at the center of the stage and replaces the bottom half of the mast. The goal is located right at the drop off of the enemy spawn point. The Tower travels down the hallways leading into the enemy base, then lower down into their area and forwards until it is up against the opposing team's raised platform. Additional blocks have been added to make it easier to access the whole map and enter the opposing team's side.\n\nThe Rainmaker is located at the center of the stage and replaces the bottom half of the mast. The goal is located right at the drop off of the enemy spawn point. The layout of the stage is similar to Tower Control, but some of the blocks have been removed, and a new sponge has been added in the main path. Players can try to run into the enemy base through the main path accessible in Turf Wars or take an additional route to the left.\n\nIn Splatoon 3 the checkpoints are located through entering the main path and after the jump to the right of the bunker. The pedestal has been moved slightly forward. While the block on the left is removed, it is still possible to access the left through a jump from the checkpoint.\n\nThe baskets are located behind each team's structure past the narrow hall leading into their base. The only changes made to this mode is the inkable block that allows access to the right side of the enemy's spawn, which is present in Tower Control and Rainmaker. This layout of the stage provides three primary routes to reach the basket. The right path is the most direct, having players jump over an opening and going directly to the basket. The center path leads through the hallways leading into the enemy base. The left path allows players to sneak behind enemy lines and circle back to the basket.\n\nManta Maria was the first regular stage to be added to Splatoon 2 after launch. The stage was revealed, though briefly shown, in the Splatoon 2 Nintendo Direct on 6 July 2017, before an official name and release date were revealed on 22 August 2017. The stage was released on 26 August 2017 at 02:00 UTC.[1]\n\n- Fixed an issue in Manta Maria allowing players to enter into certain pillars in the stage.\n\n- Fixed an issue causing ink fired at the center mast on Manta Maria to drip in an unnatural manner.\n\n- Fixed an issue causing players to get caught when walking over grates near spawn points on Manta Maria.\n\n- Fixed an issue on Manta Maria and Snapper Canal where the \"DON'T RETREAT!\" warning in Rainmaker was not displaying when players returned to their spawn point.\n\n- Fixed an issue on Manta Maria in which, if a player did a Splashdown on a specific place, they would be treated as out of bounds after landing and be killed.\n\n- Fixed an issue in Turf War on Manta Maria in which the area beneath the thick pillars was inkable, and was counted as part of the turf.\n\n- Fixed an issue in Tower Control on Manta Maria in which players were able to jump from a high spot near the center of the stage to a part of the opponents' base.\n\n- Fixed an issue in Manta Maria during Rainmaker matches allowing players to make their way deep into enemy turf from above the goal.\n\n- Fixed an issue in Manta Maria causing players to be treated as if they'd fallen off-screen after performing a dodge roll on top of certain walls.\n\n- Fixed an issue allowing players to gain access to the opponent's base via a specific grate when jumping while pressing and holding  to ink continuously with the Inkbrush or Octobrush.\n\n- Fixed an issue in which it was possible to enter the opposing team's base by jumping from certain walls.\n\n- Turf War\n\n- Splat Zones\n\n- Tower Control\n\n- Rainmaker\n\n- Clam Blitz\n\n- Jellyfish viewing the boat from ashore.\n\n- Manta Maria during a Splatfest.\n\n- Turf War (Splatfest) icon for Manta Maria.\n\n- Another view of Manta Maria at night time.\n\n- A screenshot of the stage with incomplete texture work, found in the game's data.\n\n- A promotional image for the ship, CHIKYU, appearing in the background as part of the JAMSTEC collaboration.\n\n- The CHIKYU as it appears in-game.\n\n- Another view of the CHIKYU.\n\n- The CHIKYU in the distance, behind an Inkling boy.\n\n- A view of the CHIKYU at night from the Manta Maria.\n\n- Another view of the CHIKYU at night.\n\n- The Octo Expansion's F09 Bring It Station features the stage.\n\nManta Maria was confirmed to return in Fresh Season 2023 on  09:02 UTC on the @SplatoonJP Twitter account, alongside a showcase of the Kraken Royale special. Inkrails have been added to the stage.[2] The alley behind the bunker area was widened, with the ramps behind that alley in the pit in front of spawn being expanded slightly. The boat near spawn, which was previously inaccessible without using glitches, was made into an inkable platform and can be reached by launching out of the spawner. However, in Tower Control and Rainmaker, the player cannot launch to the boat.\n\nManta Maria was available in the following Splatfests as a Tricolor Turf War stage in Splatoon 3:\n\n- Kaiten-yaki vs. Ōban-yaki vs. Imagawa-yaki\n\n- Handshake vs. Fist Bump vs. Hug\n\n- Past vs. Present vs. Future\n\n- Land vs. Sea vs. Air\n\n- — Fixed an issue where performing a Dodge Roll toward the mast immediately after entering swim form while on top of the grate in the center of the stage sometimes caused the player to clip into the mast and get stuck.\n\n- — Slightly changed terrain in all modes.\n\n- Turf War\n\n- Splat Zones\n\n- Tower Control\n\n- Rainmaker\n\n- Clam Blitz\n\n- Tricolor Turf War\n\n- Turf War\n\n- Splat Zones\n\n- Tower Control\n\n- Rainmaker\n\n- Clam Blitz\n\n- Manta Maria shown on the Fresh Season 2023 promotional poster.\n\n- The wooden spawn area.\n\n- Jellyfish on shore\n\n- Water droplets on the screen.\n\n- Overhead view of the stage's Tricolor Turf War layout.\n\n- The ship in this stage is the same model as one Pearl received for her sixth birthday.\n\n- Marina says that the ship has been decommissioned, which could explain why the stage is used for Turf Wars.\n\n- In the promo picture, a jellyfish can be seen walking across the mast.\n\n- During a Splatfest Battle, shooting stars can be seen streaking across the sky.\n\n- Manta Maria is one of four multiplayer stages to appear in the Octo Expansion, alongside Snapper Canal, Port Mackerel, and Starfish Mainstage.\n\n- According to The Art of Splatoon 2, there is an Octarian ship near Manta Maria that is disguised as a squid fishing ship and is used to gain intel on the Inklings.\n\n- This stage may be a reference to Yokohama, Japan. The Yokohama Port Museum is a ship that is used as a museum and looks very similar to Manta Maria. Additionally, there are similar buildings and structures in the background of the stage. For example, there is a Ferris wheel which is also in Yokohama.\n\n- Players can use the Zipcaster to reach grated platforms high up on the three pillars.\n\n- In areas higher up on the stage, water droplets can accumulate on the screen. They appear around the edges and slowly disappear over time.\n\n- A Ferris wheel also seen in the Reef can be seen in-between buildings in the background.\n\nManta Maria is derived from manta and Christopher Columbus's ship, Santa María."
