It includes two spawn points on opposite towers, meeting together in the center through a network of ramps. Although the large amount of ramps provides an easy way to ink turf, players may also jump from ramp to ramp for a quick route to the center. Many of the towers here contain parking garages. Due to the bottleneck nature of the ramps leading from the middle, it is relatively difficult for teams to advance past the center area. Unless teams can invade the other team's base and hold them back, matches are often decided by which team can ink more of the middle in the last five seconds of the match.\n\nIn Splatoon 2, the overall stage layout is relatively unchanged. However, the central area was expanded with the cap between the ramp on the lower area and the enemy's floor filled in, as well as the addition of more room at the end of each team's alley. Most notably, two Inkrails were added on either side of the map - one at the end of the alley in the central area, designed to give another point of access to the opposing team's side, and another from each team's lower floor which takes then up the ramp.\n\nIn Ranked Battles, specifications for the terrain or placement of objects are different between the modes; these changes create new paths or new objects to take cover behind.\n\nThere are two Splat Zones on Moray Towers, both being on the ending part of the ramps closest to the center. They are the smallest Splat Zones on any stage in the game.\n\nIn Splatoon 2, the location of the two Splat Zones has been changed, both having been moved to the central area of the stage, making taking control of both zones significantly easier.\n\nThe Tower can be found directly in the center of the stage, on the small, raised platform. It makes its way over the center area, above a chasm, and finally, into its goal on the section above the second-lowest ramp. The sides in the center area retain the smaller design from the old layout, but the walls are still added from the other modes.\n\nThe Rainmaker in Moray Towers starts in the center of the stage on the small incline. The goal is located below the first big drop off outside of the opposing team's base. Climbing up towers will lower the counter significantly. Turning left then straight will lead to a giant wall to the left will lower the counter down to about 45 count. the wall straight ahead of the starting position will lower it down to about 60 count. Inkrails have been added to help making more progress easier.\n\nThe baskets are located just past the first ramp on both sides. It is possible to score from above the baskets with a precise throw. Due to the baskets being so close together yet far from the spawn, both largely preventing defensive play and allowing clams to spawn near the basket, Moray Towers is generally considered a bad stage for Clam Blitz by many players within the competitive community.\n\nMoray Towers was released on 11 July 2015 at 02:00 UTC.[1]\n\n- Adjusted stage layout in Splat Zones and Tower Control.\n\n- Changes to the layout in Turf War to match the layout in Splat Zones.\n\n- Turf War\n\n- Splat Zones\n\n- Tower Control\n\n- Rainmaker\n\n- The map of Moray Towers in Turf War before version 2.6.0.\n\n- Callie and Marie announcing the stage for North America.\n\n- Moray Towers shown on a screen outside Inkopolis Tower.\n\n- The battle commencing in Moray Towers.\n\n- Inklings battling for turf.\n\n- An Inkling with a blaster descending the tower.\n\n- During a Splatfest.\n\n- An overheard view of Moray Towers.\n\n- A jellyfish construction worker at Moray Towers during a Splatfest.\n\n- Jellyfish hanging out by a car.\n\n- Cars around Moray Towers\n\n- The parking machine\n\n- The view from Moray Towers.\n\n- A 3D sketch of Moray Towers.\n\n- An overhead sketch of Moray Towers.\n\n- Concept art of different locations. \"Parking\" is an early sketch of Moray Towers.\n\n- A bird's-eye view of Moray Towers.\n\n- Moray Towers during a Splatfest\n\n- The road near Moray Towers during a Splatfest.\n\n- Other buildings nearby\n\nMoray Towers was available in the following Splatfests in Splatoon:\n\n- Lemon Tea vs. Milk Tea\n\n- Marshmallows vs. Hot Dogs\n\n- North Pole vs. South Pole\n\n- Airhead vs. Wisecracker\n\n- Cats vs. Dogs (October 2015)\n\n- Pirates vs. Ninjas\n\n- Show No Mercy! vs. Focus on Healing\n\n- Hoverboard vs. Jet Pack\n\n- Callie vs. Marie\n\nMoray Towers returned in Splatoon 2 at the game's launch. The center of the stage has been slightly expanded and modified, while the towers themselves are wider. There are also the additions of new Inkrails that travel over the center of the stage and lead to vantage points. It is also used in Octo Canyon mission 21, Octolings Ahoy!.\n\n- Fixed an issue in Moray Towers causing players who fell off the stage near its center to fall faster than in other stages.\n\n- Fixed an issue in Splat Zones on Moray Towers in which the border indicating the Zone area was incorrect for part of the Zone.\n\n- Changed terrain in all Battle types.\nAdjusted trajectory of the Inkrails that leads to the enemy base from both sides.\nIncreased width of the platform beneath the Inkrails mentioned above.\nAdjusted placement of other miscellaneous objects.\n\n- Adjusted trajectory of the Inkrails that leads to the enemy base from both sides.\n\n- Increased width of the platform beneath the Inkrails mentioned above.\n\n- Adjusted placement of other miscellaneous objects.\n\n- Outside of Splatfests, reduced brightness of the sun, and reduced the disparity in visibility between teams.\n\n- Adjusted trajectory of the Inkrails that leads to the enemy base from both sides.\n\n- Increased width of the platform beneath the Inkrails mentioned above.\n\n- Adjusted placement of other miscellaneous objects.\n\n- Fixed an issue on Moray Towers in which players could stay in squid form on certain narrow steel girders.\n\n- Fixed an issue on Moray Towers in which the starting position of one side's team would be slightly off-point.\n\n- Fixed an issue causing turf inked not to appear as inked on the turf map.\n\n- Turf War\n\n- Splat Zones\n\n- Tower Control\n\n- Rainmaker\n\n- Clam Blitz\n\n- Moray Towers in Splatoon 2.\n\n- Moray Towers with Inkrails from the Splatoon 2 promotion.\n\n- Moray Towers after changes were made in version 2.1.0 of Splatoon 2.\n\n- Moray Towers during a Splatfest.\n\n- Turf War (Splatfest) icon for Moray Towers.\n\n- An Inkling looking down on ink in Moray Towers.\n\n- An object that looks to resemble a parking ticket machine.\n\nMoray Towers is the basis for a stage in Super Smash Bros.
