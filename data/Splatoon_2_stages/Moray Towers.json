    "Moray Towers is a multiplayer stage in Splatoon and Splatoon 2. It takes place on a parking garage. The stage is largely vertical, with zigzagging paths leading down to the center area.",
    "Moray Towers consists of two large towers connected by a series of diagonal ramps on smaller towers. It includes two spawn points on opposite towers, meeting together in the center through a network of ramps. Although the large amount of ramps provides an easy way to ink turf, players may also jump from ramp to ramp for a quick route to the center. Many of the towers here contain parking garages. Due to the bottleneck nature of the ramps leading from the middle, it is relatively difficult for teams to advance past the center area. Unless teams can invade the other team's base and hold them back, matches are often decided by which team can ink more of the middle in the last five seconds of the match.",
    "In Splatoon 2, the overall stage layout is relatively unchanged. However, the central area was expanded with the cap between the ramp on the lower area and the enemy's floor filled in, as well as the addition of more room at the end of each team's alley. Most notably, two Inkrails were added on either side of the map - one at the end of the alley in the central area, designed to give another point of access to the opposing team's side, and another from each team's lower floor which takes then up the ramp.",
    "In Ranked Battles, specifications for the terrain or placement of objects are different between the modes; these changes create new paths or new objects to take cover behind.",
    "There are two Splat Zones on Moray Towers, both being on the ending part of the ramps closest to the center. They are the smallest Splat Zones on any stage in the game.",
    "In Splatoon 2, the location of the two Splat Zones has been changed, both having been moved to the central area of the stage, making taking control of both zones significantly easier.",
    "The Tower can be found directly in the center of the stage, on the small, raised platform. It makes its way over the center area, above a chasm, and finally, into its goal on the section above the second-lowest ramp. The sides in the center area retain the smaller design from the old layout, but the walls are still added from the other modes.",
    "The Rainmaker in Moray Towers starts in the center of the stage on the small incline. The goal is located below the first big drop off outside of the opposing team's base. Climbing up towers will lower the counter significantly. Turning left then straight will lead to a giant wall to the left will lower the counter down to about 45 count. the wall straight ahead of the starting position will lower it down to about 60 count. Inkrails have been added to help making more progress easier.",
    "The baskets are located just past the first ramp on both sides. It is possible to score from above the baskets with a precise throw. Due to the baskets being so close together yet far from the spawn, both largely preventing defensive play and allowing clams to spawn near the basket, Moray Towers is generally considered a bad stage for Clam Blitz by many players within the competitive community.",
    "Moray Towers was released on 11 July 2015 at 02:00 UTC.[1]",
    "Moray Towers was available in the following Splatfests in Splatoon:",
    "Moray Towers returned in Splatoon 2 at the game's launch. The center of the stage has been slightly expanded and modified, while the towers themselves are wider. There are also the additions of new Inkrails that travel over the center of the stage and lead to vantage points. It is also used in Octo Canyon mission 21, Octolings Ahoy!.",
    "Moray Towers is the basis for a stage in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Judd and Li'l Judd make a cameo in the stage, indicating the winning player or team by holding up flags, similar to their results display in the Splatoon series. Due to the 2D gameplay, only one tower is used.",
    "The map's name is a reference to the real-life moray eel.",
