  "content": "The Rapid Blaster is a main weapon in the Splatoon series, manufactured by Deco.\n\nThe Rapid Blaster is a shooter in Splatoon and Splatoon 2, and a blaster in Splatoon 3, that is similar to the Blaster, but fires much faster and has greater range. However, this comes at the cost of less ink coverage, a smaller blast radius, and weaker shots. At minimum, it takes one direct hit and one indirect hit to splat an opponent with this weapon. Its close relative, the Rapid Blaster Pro, has slightly longer range and a slightly slower fire rate. The fire rate is faster than that of the Luna Blaster, and slower than that of the Clash Blaster.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Splatoon\n\n2.1 Data\n2.2 Version history\n2.3 Quotes\n2.4 Gallery\n2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3 Splatoon 2\n\n3.1 Data\n3.2 Version history\n3.3 Quotes\n3.4 Gallery\n3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 4 Splatoon 3\n\n4.1 Data\n4.2 Version history\n4.3 Quotes\n4.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n4.5 Gallery\n\n- 4.1 Data\n\n- 4.2 Version history\n\n- 4.3 Quotes\n\n- 4.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 4.5 Gallery\n\n- 5 Strategy\n\n- 6 Trivia\n\n- 7 Names in other languages\n\n- 8 References\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 4.1 Data\n\n- 4.2 Version history\n\n- 4.3 Quotes\n\n- 4.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 4.5 Gallery\n\nThe Rapid Blaster is mainly gray with a black handle. Multiple red panels are located on the top and sides. The tip of the barrel, which is connected to the body with a small black tube, is orange.\n\nThe Rapid Blaster comes with Ink Mines and Bubbler.

It's not as powerful as the Blaster, but its fast shots and powerful Ink Mines are great for pressuring foes. With a Bubbler as well, it's probably the easiest blaster to use, so I'd recommend giving it a try!(NA)\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- The second farthest left Inkling wields the Rapid Blaster.\n\n- The Rapid Blaster's range.\n\n- Official art of a team of Inklings - the farthest is holding a Rapid Blaster.\n\n- Official art of an Inkling holding the Rapid Blaster.\n\n- Concept art of an Inkling wielding the Rapid Blaster.\n\n- Concept art of various weapons, with the Rapid Blaster at the lower left.\n\n- An Inkling firing the Rapid Blaster in an early version of Blackbelly Skatepark.\n\n- Render\n\n- SplatNet icon\n\nThe Rapid Blaster returns in Splatoon 2 looking identical to how it was in the first game, but with a slightly tweaked performance.

It comes with the trade-off of less attack power, but you can reveal your opponents' positions to teammates with the Ink Mine! Finish off the tracked opponents with the Splat-Bomb Launcher! Recommended for players that like to work closely with their team!\n\n- Promotional image\n\nThe Rapid Blaster returns in Splatoon 3 with an updated design, and has Ink Mines as its sub and Triple Inkstrike as its special.\n\nIt appears in one mission in Return of the Mammalians:\n\n- 0507 One-Way Ride through Target Town\n\n- The Rapid Blaster is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 16.7.

Now, if you know me at all, you know I'm going to tell you about a big trade-off, and it's this: low power. But using the Ink Mine to reveal enemy positions helps make up for it. What I'd do with a combo like this is use the Rapid Blaster to create a whirlwind of ink, then take it to the next level with a Triple Inkstrike. This setup lets you focus in on key areas of the map - whether you're defending the home base or pushing an advance into hostile territory.\n\n- An Inkling holding the Rapid Blaster while placing Ink Mines.\n\n- 2D icon before version 3.0.0.\n\n- 2D icon after version 3.0.0.\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Rapid Blaster.\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:Splatoon_3_Rapid_Blaster_and_Rapid_Blaster_Deco_animations.mp4\n\n\nThe difference between the versions of the Rapid Blaster: The Rapid Blaster Deco does not illuminate when fired.

This cap is also seen on the Rapid Blaster Pro.\n\n- Prior to version 3.0.0 of Splatoon 3, the colored parts on the 2D icons for the Rapid Blaster and the Rapid Blaster Pro were colored yellow.
