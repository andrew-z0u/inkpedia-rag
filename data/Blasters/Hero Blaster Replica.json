To unlock the Hero Blaster Replica, the player must complete every level with the Hero Blaster in Octo Canyon, in which it becomes available for purchase at Ammo Knights.\n\n- The Hero Blaster Replica is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 133. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The ink consumption of 10% and ink tank capacity of 100% allows players to fire 10 shots before needing to refill the ink supply.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- When initially firing the weapon in humanoid form, the first shot takes 14 frames to come out.\n\n- When firing from swim form, the first shot takes 24 frames to come out.\n\n- The interval between firing and when the player is able to enter swim form or use a sub weapon is 23 frames.\n\n- When firing continuously, it shoots a bullet every 50 frames (1.2 shots per second).\n\n- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.45 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 60 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Each shot has a base damage of 125.\n\n- The bullet hitbox has a radius of 2 units.\n\n- Shots cannot ever deviate from the inner reticle while on the ground.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while in the air is 10 degrees.\n\n- The outer reticle immediately expands after jumping. After 25 frames, the outer reticle will start shrinking, and will finish shrinking after 70 frames.\n\n- When jumping, the chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle is immediately set to 50%.\n\n- Shots initially travel straight at a rate of 9.45 units per frame for 9 frames. Shots travel straight for 85.05 distance units.\nAfter that, the shot's velocity is set to 9.131 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and decreases further as it travels.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 9.131 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and decreases further as it travels.\n\n- Ink droplets occur every 15 units.\n\n- The frequency at which ink drips from a shot occurs at a rate of 7 droplets per shot.\n\n- There are a total of 1 different droplet patterns that can be created while firing this weapon.\n\n- Ink droplets have a radius of 13.5 units.\n\n- Droplets have their radius multiplied by a value ranging from 1 if they fell from a height above 100 units to 1.2 if they fell from a height below 30 units.\n\n- The shot explodes 13 frames after being fired.\n\n- The far damage radius of the explosion is 33 units.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 9.131 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and decreases further as it travels.\n\n- When the shot explodes on the ground or wall, the far damage radius is 16.5 units.\n\n- The near damage radius of the explosion is 9.4 units.\n\n- Damage from the explosion scales from 50 at the far damage radius to 70 at the near damage radius.\n\n- When the shot explodes on the ground or wall, the damage scales from 25 at the far damage radius to 35 at the near damage radius.\n\n- When the shot explodes in the air, it creates a splash of paint with a radius of 32 units.\n\n- The radius of wall dripping paint is 10 units.\n\n- The wall impact painting radius is 22 units.\n\n[1][2]\n\n- ▲ Reduced duration of wobble time when firing after jumping by 1/4 of a second.\n\n- ▲ Points to fill special gauge: 180 → 170\n\n- ▲ Increased radius of ink at the player's feet, and revised the coverage to extend behind the player more than it did previously.\n\n- ▲ Increased radius of ink coverage when shots hit a wall.\n\n- ▲ Reduced movement penalty after firing by 7/60 of a second.\n\n- ▼ Points to fill special gauge: 170 → 190\n\n- ▼ Decreased damage radius of exploding shots by 6%.\n\n- ▲ Points to fill special gauge: 190 → 180\n\n- ▲ Points to fill special gauge: 180 → 170\n\nThe Hero Blaster Replica is a specially designed blaster with the same stats as the standard Blaster. This weapon came about after I made a breakthrough in my research and managed to create the ultimate weapon! Sadly, it never made it to mass production because the guys at the factory couldn't wrap their heads around my advanced schematics... So instead they just slapped some shiny parts on a standard Blaster and called it the Hero Blaster Replica.\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- Hero weapons, with the Hero Blaster Replica in the bottom right.\n\nFor competitive tips about the Hero Blaster Replica\n\nNote: the strategy advice for Blaster also applies to Hero Blaster Replica, so they share the same strategy page."
