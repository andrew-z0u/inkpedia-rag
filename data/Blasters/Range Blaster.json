As a tradeoff, this blaster has a lower fire rate and higher ink consumption.\n\nIn Splatoon and Splatoon 2, the Range Blaster is similar in appearance to the Blaster. However, the front and back parts of the Range Blaster have been pushed further apart by some metal supports.\n\nIn Splatoon 3, the frontal part is much larger, less cylinder-like, and partially covers the aforementioned metal supports. The main body is thicker and has four tubes connected to it.\n\nThe Range Blaster was released on 1 August 2015 02:00 UTC.[1][2] It comes with the Splash Wall and Inkstrike. Each shot consumes 10% of the ink tank capacity, and the ink tank recovers 1.67% of its capacity between each shot, allowing the player to fire 11 shots before needing to refill the tank.\n\n- The Range Blaster is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- Each shot consumes 10% of the ink tank capacity.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- When firing continuously, it shoots a bullet every 60 frames (1 shots per second).\n\n- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.4 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 50 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Each shot has a base damage of 125.\n\n- Shots travel straight for 11 frames.\n\n- Shots have a radius of 2 units.\n\n- Shots cannot ever deviate from the inner reticle while on the ground.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while in the air is 10 degrees.\n\n- The outer reticle immediately expands after jumping. The outer reticle will finish shrinking after 60 frames.\n\n- When jumping, the chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle is immediately set to 40%.\n\n- Shots initially travel straight at a rate of 10.8 units per frame for 11 frames. Shots travel straight for 118.80000209 distance units.\n\n- Ink droplets occur every 15 units.\n\n- The frequency at which ink drips from a shot occurs at a rate of 9 droplets per shot.\n\n- There are a total of 1 different droplet patterns that can be created while firing this weapon.\n\n- Droplets that occur within 11 units of the player have a radius of 19.2 units.\n\n- Droplets that occur when they travel past 200 units of the player have a radius of 18 units.\n\n- All other ink droplets have a radius of 13.5 units.\n\n- The shot explodes 15 frames after being fired.\n\n- The far damage radius of the explosion is 35 units.\n\n- When the shot explodes on the ground or wall, the far damage radius is 17.5 units.\n\n- The near damage radius of the explosion is 9 units.\n\n- Damage from the explosion scales from 50 at the far damage radius to 80 at the near damage radius.\n\n- When the shot explodes on the ground or wall, the damage scales from 25 at the far damage radius to 40 at the near damage radius.\n\n- When the shot explodes in the air, it creates a splash of paint with a radius of 32 units.\n\n- The wall impact painting radius is 18 units.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n[3]\n\n- ▼ Blast wave maximum damage: 125.0 → 80.0 (99.9[note 1] with Damage Up).\n\n- ▲ Special gauge loss: 50% → 40%.\n\nAs the name suggests, the Range Blaster is a Blaster with shots that travel farther before exploding.\nIts fire rate is reduced, but the combination of explosive power and range can be positively deadly!\nComplemented by the Splash Wall and Inkstrike, it's perfect for distance fighters!(NA)\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- An Inkling girl running with the Range Blaster.\n\n- An Inkling girl firing a shot from the Range Blaster.

Its front shell vaguely resembles the headlight or fuel tank of a motorcycle, keeping with the vehicular, hot rod motif of the standard Blaster. It was originally shown with Killer Wail 5.1 as its special, but it was changed to Suction Bombs and Wave Breaker.\n\nIt appears in two missions in Return of the Mammalians:\n\n- 0201 Twirling, Swirling, Whirling\n\n- 0207 The Ink-Conservation Project\n\n- The Range Blaster is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 17. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The ink consumption is 11% per shot, allowing the user to fire 9 shots on a full ink tank.\n\n- When firing continuously, it shoots a bullet every 60 frames (1 shot per second).\n\n- When firing from humanoid form, the first shot takes 14 frames to come out. When firing from swim form, the first shot takes 24 frames to come out.\n\n- The interval between firing the weapon and being able to enter swim form or use a sub weapon is 30 frames.\n\n- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.04 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 70 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- The damage on direct hit is 125.\n\n- Targets within 0.94 units of the explosion center always take 70 damage. Targets outside of this radius but inside the full blast radius of 3.3 units will take between 70 and 50 damage, depending on how close to the center they are.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with players has a radius of 0.2 units.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with the environment has a radius of 0.2 units.\n\n- Shots cannot ever deviate from the inner reticle while on the ground.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while in the air is 8.0 degrees.\n\n- The outer reticle immediately expands after jumping. After 25 frames, the outer reticle will start shrinking, and will finish shrinking after 70 frames.\n\n- When jumping, the chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle is immediately set to 50%.\n\n- Shots initially travel straight at a rate of 1.08 units per frame for 11 frames. Shots travel straight for 11.88 distance units.\nAfter that, the shot's velocity is set to 1.0073 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 1.0073 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- The bullet explodes 15 frames after being fired, covering a total distance of about 13.57 units.\nThis number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n- This number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 1.0073 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- This number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n[7]\n\n- Salmon Run Next Wave:\n▲ Direct damage: 200.0 → 250.0.\n▲ Maximum indirect damage: 140.0 → 150.0.\n▲ Minimum indirect damage: 100.0 → 150.0.\n▲ Ink consumption: 5.5% → 5%.\n\n- ▲ Direct damage: 200.0 → 250.0.\n\n- ▲ Maximum indirect damage: 140.0 → 150.0.\n\n- ▲ Minimum indirect damage: 100.0 → 150.0.\n\n- ▲ Ink consumption: 5.5% → 5%.\n\n- ▲ Direct damage: 200.0 → 250.0.\n\n- ▲ Maximum indirect damage: 140.0 → 150.0.\n\n- ▲ Minimum indirect damage: 100.0 → 150.0.\n\n- ▲ Ink consumption: 5.5% → 5%.\n\n- ▲ Increased the radius of ink splatter at the point of impact with a floor or wall or when detonated midair by approximately 15%.\n\n- ▼ Points to fill special gauge: 200 → 210.\n\n- ▼ Decreased the radius of the damaging explosion by approximately 6%: 3.5 units → 3.3 units.\nRadius where 70.0 damage is dealt: 1 unit → 0.94 units.\n\n- Radius where 70.0 damage is dealt: 1 unit → 0.94 units.\n\n- ▼ Decreased the radius of the ink splatter at the point of impact with a floor or wall or when detonated midair by approximately 9%.\n\n- Radius where 70.0 damage is dealt: 1 unit → 0.94 units.\n\nThe Range Blaster delays the oxidization of ink, which extends the range before it explodes. Let that sink in. It's SO COOL how it works! Of course, you lose a little fire rate, but that's OK when you have Suction Bombs to flush out your opponents. And with the Wave Breaker at your disposal to reveal their positions, it's almost like your enemies will have nowhere to hide! I recommend this loadout to anyone who fancies themselves a master of the hunt.\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- The newly designed Range Blaster (right)\n\n- The Octoling on the furthest right is holding the Range Blaster on a spawner.\n\n- A player holding the Range Blaster using the Killer Wail 5.1.\n\n- 3D art of an Octoling wielding the Range Blaster.\n\n- Same 3D art with a transparent background and different cropping.\n\n- Held by the Octoling in the center.\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Range Blaster.\n\n- Unused early version of the Range Blaster's Tableturf Battle card.
