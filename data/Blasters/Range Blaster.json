    "The Range Blaster is a main weapon in the Splatoon series. It is a blaster that sacrifices rate of fire for better range and firepower.",
    "The Range Blaster, as its name implies, is a variation of a regular Blaster with shots that travel farther before exploding. As a tradeoff, this blaster has a lower fire rate and higher ink consumption.",
    "In Splatoon and Splatoon 2, the Range Blaster is similar in appearance to the Blaster. However, the front and back parts of the Range Blaster have been pushed further apart by some metal supports.",
    "In Splatoon 3, the frontal part is much larger, less cylinder-like, and partially covers the aforementioned metal supports. The main body is thicker and has four tubes connected to it.",
    "The Range Blaster was released on 1 August 2015 02:00 UTC.[1][2] It comes with the Splash Wall and Inkstrike. Each shot consumes 10% of the ink tank capacity, and the ink tank recovers 1.67% of its capacity between each shot, allowing the player to fire 11 shots before needing to refill the tank.",
    "[3]",
    "As the name suggests, the Range Blaster is a Blaster with shots that travel farther before exploding.\nIts fire rate is reduced, but the combination of explosive power and range can be positively deadly!\nComplemented by the Splash Wall and Inkstrike, it's perfect for distance fighters!(NA)",
    "The Range Blaster returns in Splatoon 2 looking identical to how it did in the first game. It was released on 21 October 2017 at 02:00 UTC[4]. It comes with Suction Bombs and Ink Storm. Each shot consumes 11% of the ink tank capacity, allowing the player to fire nine shots before needing to refill the tank.",
    "It appears in two Octo Expansion stations:",
    "[5][6]",
    "The Range Blaster delays the oxidization of ink, which extends the range before it explodes!\nIts special construction reduces the fire rate slightly, but its long range and Suction Bombs let you put the squeeze on your opponents!\nThe Ink Storm helps cover the surrounding area, too, so I'd recommend this for players that are on the hunt for ink!",
    "The Range Blaster returns in Splatoon 3 with a new design. Its front shell vaguely resembles the headlight or fuel tank of a motorcycle, keeping with the vehicular, hot rod motif of the standard Blaster. It was originally shown with Killer Wail 5.1 as its special, but it was changed to Suction Bombs and Wave Breaker.",
    "It appears in two missions in Return of the Mammalians:",
    "[7]",
    "The Range Blaster delays the oxidization of ink, which extends the range before it explodes. Let that sink in. It's SO COOL how it works! Of course, you lose a little fire rate, but that's OK when you have Suction Bombs to flush out your opponents. And with the Wave Breaker at your disposal to reveal their positions, it's almost like your enemies will have nowhere to hide! I recommend this loadout to anyone who fancies themselves a master of the hunt.",
