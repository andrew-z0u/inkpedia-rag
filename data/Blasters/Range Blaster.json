    "The Range Blaster is a main weapon in the Splatoon series. It is a blaster that sacrifices rate of fire for better range and firepower.",
    "The Range Blaster, as its name implies, is a variation of a regular Blaster with shots that travel farther before exploding. As a tradeoff, this blaster has a lower fire rate and higher ink consumption.",
    "In Splatoon and Splatoon 2, the Range Blaster is similar in appearance to the Blaster. However, the front and back parts of the Range Blaster have been pushed further apart by some metal supports.",
    "In Splatoon 3, the frontal part is much larger, less cylinder-like, and partially covers the aforementioned metal supports. The main body is thicker and has four tubes connected to it.",
    "The Range Blaster was released on 1 August 2015 02:00 UTC.[1][2] It comes with the Splash Wall and Inkstrike. Each shot consumes 10% of the ink tank capacity, and the ink tank recovers 1.67% of its capacity between each shot, allowing the player to fire 11 shots before needing to refill the tank.",
