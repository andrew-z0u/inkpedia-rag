It's \"totally metal\", or so I'm assured. The black and green flame design is for squids who want their look to be as aggressive as their weapon. The Main works just like a Range Blaster, but the new Burst Bombs really amp up the splat speed of this set. The impressive range of the Killer Wail also adds a lot. Try this set out if you think you have a good feel for the range of a Blaster type weapon!(NA/EU/OC)\n\n- Promotional image.\n\n- An Inkling running with a Grim Range Blaster equipped.\n\n- The Grim Range Blaster being held.\n\n- Firing a ball of ink from a Grim Range Blaster.\n\n- The poster boy Inkling of Sheldon's Picks Vol. 2 uses a Grim Range Blaster.\n\n- SplatNet icon\n\nThe Grim Range Blaster was released on 3 April 2019 at 01:00 UTC as part of the 4.6.0 version release.[3].
