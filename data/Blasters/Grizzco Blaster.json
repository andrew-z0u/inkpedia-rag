The range of the weapon is comparable to the Luna Blaster while the firing rate of the weapon is much greater than even the Clash Blaster.\n\nThe Grizzco Blaster is somewhat similar in appearance to the Blaster. However, the front has been completely stripped off, revealing the metal frame and inner workings. Multiple red and orange wires and metal blocks can be seen. Sticking out of the top are four yellow pill bottles with white caps, the contents of which are unknown. The ink tank has a dark green Grizzco Industries logo on the side.\n\nThe Grizzco Blaster is a rare weapon only available during Salmon Run wildcard rotations. It was first available on 16 September 2017 at 00:00 UTC.\n\n- The Grizzco Blaster is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The ink consumption of 3%  allows players to fire 33 shots before needing to refill the ink supply.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- When initially firing the weapon in humanoid form, the first shot takes 14 frames to come out.\n\n- When firing from swim form, the first shot takes 24 frames to come out.\n\n- The interval between firing and when the player is able to enter swim form or use a sub weapon is 6 frames.\n\n- When firing continuously, it shoots a bullet every 9 frames (6.67 shots per second).\n\n- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.8 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 5 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Each shot has a base damage of 50.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with the environment has a radius of 1.0 units.\n\n- Shots cannot ever deviate from the inner reticle while on the ground.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while in the air is 10.0 degrees.\n\n- The outer reticle immediately expands after jumping. After 0 frames, the outer reticle will start shrinking, and will finish shrinking after 60 frames.\n\n- When jumping, the chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle is immediately set to 40%.\n\n- Shots initially travel straight at a rate of 8.7 units per frame for 7 frames. Shots travel straight for 60.9 distance units.\nAfter that, the shot's velocity is set to 8.484 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and decreases further as it travels.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 8.484 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and decreases further as it travels.\n\n- Ink droplets occur every 50.0 units.\n\n- The frequency at which ink drips from a shot occurs at a rate of 1.5 droplets per shot.\n\n- There are a total of 2 different droplet patterns that can be created while firing this weapon.\n\n- Droplets that occur within 11.0 units of the player have a radius of 19.200001 units, and a width of 0.0 units.\n\n- Droplets that occur when they travel past 200.0 units of the player have a radius of 18.0 units.\n\n- All other ink droplets have a radius of 12.0 units.\n\n- The shot explodes 11 frames after being fired.\n\n- The far damage radius of the explosion is 35.0 units.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 8.484 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and decreases further as it travels.\n\n- When the shot explodes on the ground or wall, the far damage radius is 35 units.\n\n- The near damage radius of the explosion is 8.0 units.\n\n- Damage from the explosion is 35. Damage does not change based on distance from the center of the explosion.\n\n- When the shot explodes on the ground or wall, the damage is 35.\n\n- When the shot explodes in the air, it creates a splash of paint with a radius of 32.0 units.\n\n- The wall impact painting radius is 22.0 units.\n\nIn Splatoon 2, the Grizzco Blaster was available during the following wildcard rotations:\n\n- A message telling the player they were loaned the Grizzco Blaster.\n\n- An Inkling holding the Grizzco Blaster after a shift.\n\nThe Grizzco Blaster returns in Splatoon 3, and is once again only available during wildcard rotations in Salmon Run. It was first available on 28 October 2022 at 08:00 UTC.\n\n- The Grizzco Blaster is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The ink consumption is 3% per shot, and 0.66% is recovered every shot, allowing the user to fire 42 shots on a full ink tank.\n\n- When firing continuously, it shoots a bullet every 9 frames (6.67 shots per second).\n\n- When firing from humanoid form, the first shot takes 14 frames to come out. When firing from swim form, the first shot takes 24 frames to come out.\n\n- The interval between firing the weapon and being able to enter swim form or use a sub weapon is 6 frames.\n\n- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.08 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 5 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- The damage on direct hit is 50.\n\n- The blast has a radius of 3.5 units and deals 35 damage.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with players has a radius of 0.1 units.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with the environment has a radius of 0.1 units.\n\n- Shots cannot ever deviate from the inner reticle while on the ground.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while in the air is 10.0 degrees.\n\n- The outer reticle immediately expands after jumping. After 25 frames, the outer reticle will start shrinking, and will finish shrinking after 70 frames.\n\n- When jumping, the chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle is immediately set to 50%.\n\n- Shots initially travel straight at a rate of 0.87 units per frame for 7 frames. Shots travel straight for 6.09 distance units.\nAfter that, the shot's velocity is set to 0.8484 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 0.8484 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- The bullet explodes 11 frames after being fired, covering a total distance of about 7.45 units.\nThis number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n- This number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 0.8484 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight).
