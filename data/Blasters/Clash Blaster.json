Compared to other blasters, which require a direct hit for quick splats, the Clash Blaster fires more rapidly, increasing mobility and turf coverage.\n\nThe Clash Blaster's main body is a light navy blue and shaped a bit like a pencil sharpener. Surrounding it is a ring of crayons that change color to match the user's ink that resembles a gun belt. Coming down from the body is a metal trigger and a handhold with black padding. Sticking out of the front of the body is a flat, rectangular, metal part that delivers the shots. Atop this part is a sight the same color as the body.\n\nThe Clash Blaster was released in Splatoon 2 at the game's initial release. Its kit contains Splat Bomb and Sting Ray.\n\nIt appears in two Octo Expansion stations:\n\n- G09 B05 Wack 8-Ball Station\n\n- J07 Outrageous Station\n\n- The Clash Blaster is a lightweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 110. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The ink consumption of 4% and ink tank capacity of 100% allows players to fire 25 shots before needing to refill the ink supply.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- When initially firing the weapon in humanoid form, the first shot takes 12 frames to come out.\n\n- When firing from swim form, the first shot takes 21 frames to come out.\n\n- The interval between firing and when the player is able to enter swim form or use a sub weapon is 20 frames.\n\n- When firing continuously, it shoots a bullet every 20 frames (3 shots per second).\n\n- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.65 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 40 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Each shot has a base damage of 60.\n\n- The bullet hitbox has a radius of 2 units.\n\n- Shots cannot ever deviate from the inner reticle while on the ground.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while in the air is 8 degrees.\n\n- The outer reticle immediately expands after jumping. After 40 frames, the outer reticle will start shrinking, and will finish shrinking after 70 frames.\n\n- When jumping, the chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle is immediately set to 50%.\n\n- Shots initially travel straight at a rate of 9.35 units per frame for 8 frames. Shots travel straight for 74.8 distance units.\nAfter that, the shot's velocity is set to 9.2715 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and decreases further as it travels.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 9.2715 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and decreases further as it travels.\n\n- Ink droplets occur every 32 units.\n\n- The frequency at which ink drips from a shot occurs at a rate of 3 droplets per shot.\n\n- There are a total of 2 different droplet patterns that can be created while firing this weapon.\n\n- Ink droplets have a radius of 10.7 units.\n\n- Droplets have their radius multiplied by a value ranging from 1 if they fell from a height above 100 units to 2.1 if they fell from a height below 30 units.\n\n- The shot explodes 12 frames after being fired.\n\n- The far damage radius of the explosion is 40 units.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 9.2715 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and decreases further as it travels.\n\n- When the shot explodes on the ground or wall, the far damage radius is 20 units.\n\n- The near damage radius of the explosion is 10 units.\n\n- Damage from the explosion is 30. Damage does not change based on distance from the center of the explosion.\n\n- When the shot explodes on the ground or wall, the damage is 15.\n\n- When the shot explodes in the air, it creates a splash of paint with a radius of 25 units.\n\n- The wall impact painting radius is 18 units.\n\n[1][2]\n\n- ▲ Expanded area inked by a single shot.\n\n- ▲ Decreased amount of ink consumed by firing a single shot by 20%: 5.0% → 4.0%.\n\n- Salmon Run worker's Clash Blaster:\n▲ Increased damage dealt by shot explosions by approximately 25%: 40.0 → 50.0.\n▲ Decreased ink consumption of each shot by approximately 20%: 4% → 3.2%.\n\n- ▲ Increased damage dealt by shot explosions by approximately 25%: 40.0 → 50.0.\n\n- ▲ Decreased ink consumption of each shot by approximately 20%: 4% → 3.2%.\n\n- ▲ Increased damage dealt by shot explosions by approximately 25%: 40.0 → 50.0.\n\n- ▲ Decreased ink consumption of each shot by approximately 20%: 4% → 3.2%.\n\n- ▲ Increased radius of shot explosion by roughly 14%: 35 units → 40 units.\n\n- ▲ Increased amount of ink coverage delivered by exploding shots.\n\n- ▲ Reduced interval between continuous shots: 22 frames → 20 frames.\n\n- ▼ Adjusted the radius of inking and number of drops that rain down so that the inked area per unit shot doesn't become too large as a result of the above-mentioned improvement to continuous shooting.\n\n- ▼ Points to fill special gauge: 170 → 180.\n\n- ▲ Increased damage dealt to the Rainmaker barrier by roughly 11%: 1.9x → 2.1x.\n\nYou know how blasters tend to have a low rate of fire? Not the Clash Blaster! Its speedy shots are great for keeping foes at bay! Damage output has been decreased to compensate for improved rapid fire, but Splat Bombs will help you take it to your foes in a major way! Opponents keeping their distance? Reach out and touch 'em with the Sting Ray!

Now, it's not going to win any awards for power, but when you have Splat Bombs to corner your enemies, it'll get the job done. And if an opponent still manages to slip away? That's when you trash 'em with the Trizooka. Talk about a chaotic combo.
