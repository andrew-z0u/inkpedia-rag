    "The Gleamz Blaster is a main weapon in Splatoon 3. It is an Emberz-branded  version of the Blaster, with identical stats.",
    "Compared to the Blaster, the Gleamz Blaster has new colors and patterns. The usually silver metal parts and wires on the side of the weapon are black, while the flames on the front are fluorescent neon blue-purple instead of red. A fluorescent inscription is also inscribed on the side of the weapon. The tank at the rear of the weapon features new designs, including the blobmob, a logo that references the Emberz brand. A ring is also affixed around the tank, featuring the three colors of that brand. Unlike the classic Blaster variants, the Gleamz Blaster's tank does not change color to match the user's ink, always remaining neon blue-purple.",
    "The Gleamz Blaster was added as a part of the Splatlands Collection on 12 June 2025. Its kit consists of Squid Beakon and Crab Tank.",
