    "The Luna Blaster is a main weapon in the Splatoon series, created by Neo. It is a blaster with short range but above average fire rate, blast radius, and ink efficiency.",
    "Like other blasters, the Luna Blaster fires an explosive round that lets it deal damage to opponents hiding behind obstacles or around corners. It takes one direct hit or two indirect hits to splat an opponent, but shooting the opponent directly rather than relying on the blast takes careful and precise aim due to the weapon's low firing rate. However, out of all blasters that can splat opponents in one direct hit, the Luna Blaster actually has the largest blast size and fastest fire rate, at the cost of having the shortest range.",
    "The Luna Blaster's main body is round and smooth with a hole at the end to let out blaster shots. The back half is white, while the front half changes color to match the user's ink in all games. The back half houses a handhold with the trigger on it; the trigger changes to match the user's ink color. Sticking out of the back of the Luna Blaster is a ball on the end of a thin stick (white in Splatoon, matches the user's ink color in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3), and an attachment that is similar but bigger (matches the user's ink color in Splatoon, white in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3) is placed above the hole in the front. In Splatoon, there is a Neo logo written in Inkling on the back half. In Splatoon 2, the text is replaced by a faint Neo logo icon. In Splatoon 3, the parts of its casing that match the user's ink color are now semi transparent, revealing its internal components. The Neo logo is replaced by small text in gray, and there is a small seam dividing the white part of the casing into two pieces.",
    "Additionally, in Splatoon 3, the Luna Blaster features considerably more detailed effects when firing: the colored parts of the blaster will illuminate, and the casing will split into three parts (the fore colored part, and two white parts divided along the aforementioned seam).",
    "The Luna Blaster was released on 24 June 2015 at 02:00 UTC.[1][2] It comes in a set with Ink Mines and the Inkzooka.",
    "[3]",
    "The Luna Blaster is a specialized shooter that can unleash explosive power at close range!\nIts rate of fire is good, and its blasts cover a wide area, but you'll need the Inkzooka to hit far-off foes.\nOh, and the Ink Mines can really make a difference in the right hands, so this set is perfect for veterans!(NA)",
    "The Luna Blaster returns in Splatoon 2 with a modified color scheme and slightly tweaked performance. It comes with Splat Bombs and Baller.",
    "It appears in two Octo Expansion Stations:",
    "[4][5]",
    "The Luna Blaster may look cute, but its short-range exploding ink shots pack a serious wallop. It's got a decent fire rate but lacks range, so it comes with Splat Bombs to keep your opponents right where you want 'em. The final blast the Baller special provides is huge, too. Think about the map terrain around you when it's time to blow!",
    "The Luna Blaster returns in Splatoon 3 with a new design. Its kit consists of Splat Bombs and Zipcaster.",
    "It appears in one mission in Return of the Mammalians:",
    "[6]",
    "The Luna Blaster may look cute, but its short-range exploding ink shots pack a serious wallop. If you find that your enemies are dancing just outside that range, toss a few Splat Bombs to keep 'em on their toes. And for the ones sniping you from FAR away, fire up the Zipcaster, sneak behind 'em, and... well, you know what to do from there. Really, this set is ideal for players who want to read the terrain and react to their opponents' moves.",
