It takes one direct hit or two indirect hits to splat an opponent, but shooting the opponent directly rather than relying on the blast takes careful and precise aim due to the weapon's low firing rate. However, out of all blasters that can splat opponents in one direct hit, the Luna Blaster actually has the largest blast size and fastest fire rate, at the cost of having the shortest range.\n\nThe Luna Blaster's main body is round and smooth with a hole at the end to let out blaster shots. The back half is white, while the front half changes color to match the user's ink in all games. The back half houses a handhold with the trigger on it; the trigger changes to match the user's ink color. Sticking out of the back of the Luna Blaster is a ball on the end of a thin stick (white in Splatoon, matches the user's ink color in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3), and an attachment that is similar but bigger (matches the user's ink color in Splatoon, white in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3) is placed above the hole in the front. In Splatoon, there is a Neo logo written in Inkling on the back half. In Splatoon 2, the text is replaced by a faint Neo logo icon. In Splatoon 3, the parts of its casing that match the user's ink color are now semi transparent, revealing its internal components. The Neo logo is replaced by small text in gray, and there is a small seam dividing the white part of the casing into two pieces.\n\nAdditionally, in Splatoon 3, the Luna Blaster features considerably more detailed effects when firing: the colored parts of the blaster will illuminate, and the casing will split into three parts (the fore colored part, and two white parts divided along the aforementioned seam).\n\nThe Luna Blaster was released on 24 June 2015 at 02:00 UTC.[1][2] It comes in a set with Ink Mines and the Inkzooka.\n\n- The Luna Blaster is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- Each shot consumes 6% of the ink tank capacity.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- When firing continuously, it shoots a bullet every 40 frames (1.5 shots per second).\n\n- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.5 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 30 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Each shot has a base damage of 125.\n\n- Shots travel straight for 7 frames.\n\n- Shots have a radius of 2 units.\n\n- Shots cannot ever deviate from the inner reticle while on the ground.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while in the air is 10 degrees.\n\n- The outer reticle immediately expands after jumping.

Think about the map terrain around you when it's time to blow!\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- Cinnamoroll holding a Luna Blaster in art for the Hello Kitty vs. Cinnamoroll Splatfest.\n\nThe Luna Blaster returns in Splatoon 3 with a new design.

If you find that your enemies are dancing just outside that range, toss a few Splat Bombs to keep 'em on their toes. And for the ones sniping you from FAR away, fire up the Zipcaster, sneak behind 'em, and... well, you know what to do from there. Really, this set is ideal for players who want to read the terrain and react to their opponents' moves.\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Luna Blaster.\n\n- Unused early version of the Luna Blaster's Tableturf Battle card.
