The Order Blaster Replica's stats, sub weapon, and special weapon are identical to those of the Luna Blaster.\n\nTo unlock the Order Blaster Replica, the player must complete Side Order with Murch's Palette.\n\n- The Order Blaster Replica is a lightweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 11. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The ink consumption is 7.5% per shot, allowing the user to fire 13 shots on a full ink tank.\n\n- When firing continuously, it shoots a bullet every 40 frames (1.5 shots per second).\n\n- When firing from humanoid form, the first shot takes 14 frames to come out. When firing from swim form, the first shot takes 24 frames to come out.\n\n- The interval between firing the weapon and being able to enter swim form or use a sub weapon is 26 frames.\n\n- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.05 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 55 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- The damage on direct hit is 125.\n\n- Targets within 1.6 units of the explosion center always take 70 damage. Targets outside of this radius but inside the full blast radius of 3.8 units will take between 70 and 50 damage, depending on how close to the center they are.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with players has a radius of 0.2 units.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with the environment has a radius of 0.2 units.\n\n- Shots cannot ever deviate from the inner reticle while on the ground.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while in the air is 6.0 degrees.\n\n- The outer reticle immediately expands after jumping. After 25 frames, the outer reticle will start shrinking, and will finish shrinking after 70 frames.\n\n- When jumping, the chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle is immediately set to 50%.\n\n- Shots initially travel straight at a rate of 0.87 units per frame for 7 frames. Shots travel straight for 6.09 distance units.\nAfter that, the shot's velocity is set to 0.8484 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 0.8484 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- The bullet explodes 11 frames after being fired, covering a total distance of about 7.55 units.\nThis number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n- This number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 0.8484 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- This number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n[1]\n\n- ▲ Increased the radius of the ink splatter at the point of impact with terrain or when detonated midair by approximately 20%.\n\n- ▲ Damage dealt to Splash Wall increased by about 10%: 2x → 2.2x.\n\n- ▲ Increased the radius of the damaging explosion area by approximately 6%: 3.57 units → 3.8 units.\nRadius of the explosion that deals 70.0 damage: 1.5 units → 1.6 units.\n\n- Radius of the explosion that deals 70.0 damage: 1.5 units → 1.6 units.\n\n- Radius of the explosion that deals 70.0 damage: 1.5 units → 1.6 units.\n\n- ▼ Decreased explosion radius multiplier when a shot hits terrain: 0.5x → 0.4687x.\n\n- 2D icon\n\nFor competitive tips about the Order Blaster Replica\n\nNote: The strategy advice for Luna Blaster also applies to Order Blaster Replica, because of this, they share the same strategy page."
