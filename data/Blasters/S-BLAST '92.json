    "The S-BLAST '92 is a main weapon in Splatoon 3.",
    "The S-BLAST '92 bears a very strong resemblance to the original North American Super Scope, an accessory for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, which was released in 1992. The body consists of a wide barrel, with the back and most of the top being light gray, while the front and bottom side are dark gray, as well as a vermilion tip at the end, with a dark-gray scope mounted in the middle and a sight at the end of the barrel. The body is connected to a dark-gray handle with an off-black trigger in the middle and a dark-gray shoulder mount on the back. A decal with the words \"SUPER SCOPE\" is printed on one side, and, like the decals on the N-ZAP, is in English rather than the Inkling language.",
    "Firing a grounded shot will briefly emit a visible red laser from the lens of the S-BLAST '92's scope. The laser flickers slightly before deactivating.",
    "The S-BLAST '92 was revealed on 16 May 2023 in the Sizzle Season 2023 trailer. After jumping, the S-BLAST '92 shoots only about half as far as it normally would, however, with a much larger blast radius.[1] This range is similar to that of the Luna Blaster, while the grounded shot has similar range to the Range Blaster[2], with the smallest blast radius of any blaster. On 17 May 2023, Nintendo uploaded a dedicated Twitter post showcasing gameplay from the S-BLAST '92, confirming the weapon's kit to be Sprinkler and Reefslider.",

    "The S-BLAST '92 is an exciting new blaster that's equipped with two distinct ink-firing mechanisms. You'll switch between the two on the fly based on your movements! When firing normally, this is a weapon with balanced accuracy, range, and power. It won't overwhelm anyone with sheer force, but I think you'll hit the target more often than not. However, when you fire while jumping, this weapon transforms into a heavy-duty powerhouse, launching large blasts of ink that explode nearby. It's a whole different beast! Keep in mind that the range will dip in this mode, but you've got the Sprinkler sub and Reefslider special to more than make up the difference. Will you be one of the first to master this unique new weapon? Why not? Give it a try!",
    "Sorry - we're just so excited. Check out this video of the S-BLAST '92 in action. No batteries required! And note that jumping while firing is how you activate the shorter-range firing mode with bigger blasts. Keep your feet on the ground to hit faraway targets with precision.",
    "For competitive tips about the S-BLAST '92",
    "S-BLAST '92 is a shortened form of Super Blaster 1992. Super refers to the Super Scope. BLAST is short for blaster, the weapon class it belongs to. '92 is based on 1992, the year the original Super Scope model was released.",
