    "The S-BLAST '92 is a main weapon in Splatoon 3.",
    "The S-BLAST '92 bears a very strong resemblance to the original North American Super Scope, an accessory for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, which was released in 1992. The body consists of a wide barrel, with the back and most of the top being light gray, while the front and bottom side are dark gray, as well as a vermilion tip at the end, with a dark-gray scope mounted in the middle and a sight at the end of the barrel. The body is connected to a dark-gray handle with an off-black trigger in the middle and a dark-gray shoulder mount on the back. A decal with the words \"SUPER SCOPE\" is printed on one side, and, like the decals on the N-ZAP, is in English rather than the Inkling language.",
    "Firing a grounded shot will briefly emit a visible red laser from the lens of the S-BLAST '92's scope. The laser flickers slightly before deactivating.",
    "The S-BLAST '92 was revealed on 16 May 2023 in the Sizzle Season 2023 trailer. After jumping, the S-BLAST '92 shoots only about half as far as it normally would, however, with a much larger blast radius.[1] This range is similar to that of the Luna Blaster, while the grounded shot has similar range to the Range Blaster[2], with the smallest blast radius of any blaster. On 17 May 2023, Nintendo uploaded a dedicated Twitter post showcasing gameplay from the S-BLAST '92, confirming the weapon's kit to be Sprinkler and Reefslider.",

    "For competitive tips about the S-BLAST '92",
    "- The S-BLAST '92 is based on the Super Scope controller, which was initially released in 1992. However, unlike the N-ZAP, which is mostly unchanged, the design has been resized and exaggerated.",
    "- The S-BLAST '92 makes a noise when it switches to its short-range mode by jumping, even if the player is in swim form.",
    "- Unlike shooters, splatlings, dualies, and other blasters, the outer reticle of the S-BLAST '92 and its variant, the S-BLAST '91, does not shrink after jumping, due to it being a separate firing mode.",
    "- The S-BLAST '92 is not included in Return of the Mammalians due to being added post-release.",
    "S-BLAST '92 is a shortened form of Super Blaster 1992. Super refers to the Super Scope. BLAST is short for blaster, the weapon class it belongs to. '92 is based on 1992, the year the original Super Scope model was released."
