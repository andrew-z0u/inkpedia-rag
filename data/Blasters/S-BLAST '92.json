The body consists of a wide barrel, with the back and most of the top being light gray, while the front and bottom side are dark gray, as well as a vermilion tip at the end, with a dark-gray scope mounted in the middle and a sight at the end of the barrel. The body is connected to a dark-gray handle with an off-black trigger in the middle and a dark-gray shoulder mount on the back. A decal with the words \"SUPER SCOPE\" is printed on one side, and, like the decals on the N-ZAP, is in English rather than the Inkling language.\n\nFiring a grounded shot will briefly emit a visible red laser from the lens of the S-BLAST '92's scope. The laser flickers slightly before deactivating.\n\nThe S-BLAST '92 was revealed on 16 May 2023 in the Sizzle Season 2023 trailer. After jumping, the S-BLAST '92 shoots only about half as far as it normally would, however, with a much larger blast radius.[1] This range is similar to that of the Luna Blaster, while the grounded shot has similar range to the Range Blaster[2], with the smallest blast radius of any blaster. On 17 May 2023, Nintendo uploaded a dedicated Twitter post showcasing gameplay from the S-BLAST '92, confirming the weapon's kit to be Sprinkler and Reefslider.\n\n- The S-BLAST '92 is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 16.5. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The ink consumption is 9.5% per shot, allowing the user to fire 10 shots on a full ink tank.\n\n- When firing continuously, it shoots a bullet every 55 frames (1.09 shots per second).\n\n- When firing from humanoid form, the first shot takes 14 frames to come out. When firing from swim form, the first shot takes 24 frames to come out.\n\n- The interval between firing the weapon and being able to enter swim form or use a sub weapon is 26 frames.\n\n- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.04 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 60 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Shots cannot ever deviate from the inner reticle while on the ground.\n\n- The damage on direct hit is 125.\n\n- Targets within 1.0 units of the explosion center always take 70 damage. Targets outside of this radius but inside the full blast radius of 2.0 units will take between 70 and 50 damage, depending on how close to the center they are.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with players has a radius of 0.2 units.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with the environment has a radius of 0.2 units.\n\n- Shots cannot ever deviate from the inner reticle.\n\n- Shots initially travel straight at a rate of 1.7 units per frame for 7 frames. Shots travel straight for 11.9 distance units.\nAfter that, the shot's velocity is set to 1.65 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 1.65 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- The bullet explodes 11 frames after being fired, covering a total distance of about 14.54 units.\nThis number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n- This number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 1.65 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight).

Targets outside of this radius but inside the full blast radius of 4.0 units will take between 70 and 50 damage, depending on how close to the center they are.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with players has a radius of 0.2 units.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with the environment has a radius of 0.2 units.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate is 8.0 degrees.\n\n- The shot has a 50% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle.\n\n- Shots initially travel straight at a rate of 0.92 units per frame for 7 frames. Shots travel straight for 6.44 distance units.\nAfter that, the shot's velocity is set to 0.9 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 0.9 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- The bullet explodes 11 frames after being fired, covering a total distance of about 7.97 units.\nThis number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n- This number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 0.9 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- This number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n[3]\n\n- ▲ Reduced the amount of ink consumed by approximately 15%: 10% → 8.5%.\n\n- ▲ Made midjump shot-scatter reduction (which brings it closer to scatter levels while shooting on land) from the Intensify Action gear ability easier to activate even with a smaller number of gear abilities.\nThe effect gained from equipping the maximum number of Intensify Action gear abilities will not change.\n\n- The effect gained from equipping the maximum number of Intensify Action gear abilities will not change.\n\n- The effect gained from equipping the maximum number of Intensify Action gear abilities will not change.\n\n- ▲ Increased the radius of the 50.0-damage explosion for long flight-range shots by about 11%: 1.8 units → 2 units.\n\n- ▲  Reduced the continuous fire interval by about 1/12th of a second: 60 frames → 55 frames.\n\n- ▼ Increased the amount of ink consumed by approximately 11%: 8.5% → 9.5%.\n\n- ▼ Increased the amount of time between firing and becoming able to act again by approximately 1/20th of a second: 23 frames → 26 frames.\n\nThe S-BLAST '92 is an exciting new blaster that's equipped with two distinct ink-firing mechanisms. You'll switch between the two on the fly based on your movements! When firing normally, this is a weapon with balanced accuracy, range, and power. It won't overwhelm anyone with sheer force, but I think you'll hit the target more often than not. However, when you fire while jumping, this weapon transforms into a heavy-duty powerhouse, launching large blasts of ink that explode nearby. It's a whole different beast! Keep in mind that the range will dip in this mode, but you've got the Sprinkler sub and Reefslider special to more than make up the difference. Will you be one of the first to master this unique new weapon? Why not? Give it a try!\n\nSorry - we're just so excited. Check out this video of the S-BLAST '92 in action. No batteries required! And note that jumping while firing is how you activate the shorter-range firing mode with bigger blasts. Keep your feet on the ground to hit faraway targets with precision.\n\n- Promotional render\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- S-BLAST '92 seen in a promotional image for Sizzle Season 2023.\n\n- The top left card is for the S-BLAST '92.\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the S-BLAST '92.\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_S-BLAST_%2792_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nModel of the S-BLAST '92 rotating (link to file)\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_S-BLAST_%2792_demonstration.mp4\n\n\nThe S-BLAST '92 in action (link to file)\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_S-BLAST_%2792_firing.mp4\n\n\nClose-up view of the S-BLAST '92 firing; the laser emission from a long-range shot can be seen. (link to file)\n\nFor competitive tips about the S-BLAST '92\n\n- The S-BLAST '92 is based on the Super Scope controller, which was initially released in 1992. However, unlike the N-ZAP, which is mostly unchanged, the design has been resized and exaggerated.\n\n- The S-BLAST '92 makes a noise when it switches to its short-range mode by jumping, even if the player is in swim form.\n\n- Unlike shooters, splatlings, dualies, and other blasters, the outer reticle of the S-BLAST '92 and its variant, the S-BLAST '91, does not shrink after jumping, due to it being a separate firing mode.\n\n- The S-BLAST '92 is not included in Return of the Mammalians due to being added post-release.\n\nS-BLAST '92 is a shortened form of Super Blaster 1992. Super refers to the Super Scope. BLAST is short for blaster, the weapon class it belongs to. '92 is based on 1992, the year the original Super Scope model was released."
