As its name suggests, it is a \"blaster\", a type of weapon that fires ink rounds that explode shortly after.\n\n- 1 Description\n\n- 2 Appearance\n\n- 3 Splatoon\n\n3.1 Data\n3.2 Version history\n3.3 Quotes\n3.4 Gallery\n3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 4 Splatoon 2\n\n4.1 Data\n4.2 Version history\n4.3 Quotes\n4.4 Gallery\n4.5 Demonstration\n\n- 4.1 Data\n\n- 4.2 Version history\n\n- 4.3 Quotes\n\n- 4.4 Gallery\n\n- 4.5 Demonstration\n\n- 5 Splatoon 3\n\n5.1 Data\n5.2 Version history\n5.3 Quotes\n5.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n5.5 Gallery\n\n- 5.1 Data\n\n- 5.2 Version history\n\n- 5.3 Quotes\n\n- 5.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 5.5 Gallery\n\n- 6 Strategy\n\n- 7 Super Smash Bros.

These bursts can deal damage in a wide area, allowing its user to attack opponents hiding behind obstacles and around corners. The explosive round does enough damage to splat opponents with only one direct hit or two indirect hits. Its fire rate is faster than that of the Range Blaster, and slower than that of the Luna Blaster.\n\nThe Blaster's appearance is based on the idea of a \"hot rod\", or custom, car. The rear of the weapon is a spray can, the kind of spray can that would be used to custom-paint a car. The middle of the weapon exposes the internals of the weapon as if to make it easier for the owner to tweak and maintain any custom parts inside. The exposed spring resembles the coil springs in car suspensions. The front of the weapon features a flame design characteristic of custom-painted cars, which is painted on an object that resembles a muffler.\n\nAs of Splatoon 3, the front of the weapon also features a handle, resembling ones seen on paint cans. Plus, the weapon has new animations: a lever on the left that pulls downwards, as well as the spring located in the center of the weapon that \"throws\" the front part of the weapon forward. These two animations occur with every shot.\n\nThe Blaster comes in a set with the Disruptors and Killer Wail. The weapon consumes 8% of the ink tank's capacity with each shot, and the ink tank refills 1.67% of its capacity between each shot, allowing for 15 shots to be fired before needing to refill on ink.\n\n- The Blaster is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- Each shot consumes 8% of the ink tank capacity.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- When firing continuously, it shoots a bullet every 50 frames (1.2 shots per second).\n\n- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.45 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 40 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Each shot has a base damage of 125.\n\n- Shots travel straight for 9 frames.\n\n- Shots have a radius of 2 units.\n\n- Shots cannot ever deviate from the inner reticle while on the ground.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while in the air is 10 degrees.\n\n- The outer reticle immediately expands after jumping.

It's a bit lacking in the range and fire-rate departments, but when it hits...it HITS. Even near misses deal damage thanks to the ink explosion! Pin the enemy down with the Toxic Mist sub, then hit 'em like BLAM! If they escape the mist, drop the hammer on 'em with Splashdown! This high-octane set is perfect for battlers who like to bring it on!\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- An Inkling boy holding a Blaster in-between shots.\n\n- An Inkling girl firing the Blaster.\n\nThe Blaster returns in Splatoon 3 with a slightly updated design.

HARD. When those balls of ink explode, they can even tag enemies hiding behind walls. Now, the range isn't great, and the rate of fire leaves a little to be desired, but you can always coax an enemy out of hiding with an Autobomb, can't you? On the other hand, if you're getting charged, that's when it's time to break out the Big Bubbler. Basically, if YOU want to be the one controlling the action, this is the loadout for you.\n\n- An Octoling holding the Blaster.

(link to file)\n\nFor competitive tips about the Blaster\n\nThe Blaster appears as Inkling's up smash attack in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, alongside a variety of other weapons that Inkling uses in their attacks.\n\nWhen attacking, Inkling charges up their attack and fires the Blaster upwards to deal damage to opponents above them. This attack has a large radius, much like the blaster in the Splatoon franchise, and can sometimes deal damage to opponents around Inkling if they're close enough. This also coats opponents in ink, as do most of Inkling's attacks, but does not ink the ground. It deals much lower damage if Inkling is out of ink.\n\n- Concept art for the Blaster reveals that the rear of the weapon was originally designed after a gumball machine or gachapon.[7]\n\n- The Blaster was one of the weapons that were available to use in the Splatoon 3 Splatfest World Premiere.\n\n- When doing the blaster and Autobomb trials in Judd's trials, the player has the Blaster.\n\n- The Blaster is the only weapon to have an unlockable replica from Octo Canyon, that being the Hero Blaster Replica, but to not have an equivalent in Side Order. In this case, the Order Blaster Replica in Splatoon 3 is based on the Luna Blaster."
