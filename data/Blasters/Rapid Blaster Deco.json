It functions the same as the normal Rapid Blaster but has a different kit and appearance. It has Deco arrow stickers on the sides and a blue color scheme, as opposed to the traditional red one. Its kit consists of Torpedo and Inkjet. The weapon was teased in the Fresh Season poster on 16 February 2023 and officially revealed on 21 February 2023. It released on 28 February 2023.\n\n- ▼ Points to fill special gauge: 200 → 210.\n\n- ▲ Reduced the amount of time it takes for ink to begin recovering after firing by about 1/20th of a second: 50 frames → 47 frames.\n\nThe Rapid Blaster Deco is a cool, decorated version of the Rapid Blaster. Not that the original isn't cool! You'll have to decide for yourself which one you like better. Maybe the overall loadout will help you make the choice! This one comes with the Torpedo sub to help make up for the main weapon's somewhat low attack power. And for those moments when you want to breach the front lines, you've got the Inkjet special! Not a bad little surprise to keep in your back pocket. This is a versatile set that can really shine with the right user, so I hope you get a chance to try it out!\n\n- The Rapid Blaster Deco being shown off in the Fresh Season 2023 promotional poster\n\n- Promotional render\n\n- 2D icon.\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Rapid Blaster Deco.\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Rapid_Blaster_Deco_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nModel of the Rapid Blaster Deco rotating (Link to file)\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:Splatoon_3_Rapid_Blaster_and_Rapid_Blaster_Deco_animations.mp4\n\n\nThe difference between the versions of the Rapid Blaster: The Rapid Blaster Deco does not illuminate when fired.

This could mean that it was originally intended to be a DLC item.\n\n- In Splatoon 3, the Rapid Blaster have lights which illuminate when fired.
