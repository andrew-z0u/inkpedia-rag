    "The Hero Blaster is a blaster in Splatoon 2 that is exclusively used in Octo Canyon.",
    "Like the original Blaster, the can on the back of the Hero Blaster changes according to the ink color of the wielder, though the barrel and the hoses has a different design. The hoses are black with yellow and red stripes. The barrel is black and has dots that changes according to the level of the Hero Blaster.",
    "The Hero Blaster has a design very similar to the Blaster and is usable in Octo Canyon and can be upgraded one level. Like all hero weapons in Splatoon 2, they come with switchable sub weapons of Splat Bombs, Curling Bombs and Autobombs. It is loaned by Sheldon during the level, The Experimentorium, and can be used in missions after beating the level. Beating all missions with the weapon in Octo Canyon unlocks the Hero Blaster Replica for purchase at Ammo Knights.",
    "The Hero Blaster Replica is a reward in Splatoon 2 unlocked for purchase at Ammo Knights by beating all missions with the Hero Blaster. It is a blaster-type main weapon and is visually identical to the Hero Blaster. Despite its unique appearance, it is simply a reskin of the Blaster, sharing the same stats and loadout, Toxic Mist and the Splashdown. It has dots similar to some other hero weapons.",
