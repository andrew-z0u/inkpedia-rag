The white parts of the weapon are now gray, with a camouflage texture and the addition of the Barazushi logo. Finally, a kind of red seaweed is attached to the side of the weapon.",

    "If you've got ice in your veins, consider the Rapid Blaster Pro WNT-R, a cool variant of the Rapid Blaster Pro made in collaboration with the Barazushi brand. Paired with the Suction Bomb sub weapon, you can send a cold chill through the other team's battle plan and blast them from afar. Top it all off with a frosty beverage from the Tacticooler, and this is one loadout that can send shivers down your spineâ€“if you're unlucky enough to be on the other team!",
