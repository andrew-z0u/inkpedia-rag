Its kit consists of Suction Bomb and Tacticooler.\n\n- The Rapid Blaster Pro WNT-R is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 19.2. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The ink consumption is 8% per shot, allowing the user to fire 12 shots on a full ink tank.\n\n- When firing continuously, it shoots a bullet every 40 frames (1.5 shots per second).\n\n- When firing from humanoid form, the first shot takes 12 frames to come out. When firing from swim form, the first shot takes 21 frames to come out.\n\n- The interval between firing the weapon and being able to enter swim form or use a sub weapon is 20 frames.\n\n- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.05 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 50 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- The damage on direct hit is 85.\n\n- The blast has a radius of 3.3 units and deals 35 damage.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with players has a radius of 0.2 units.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with the environment has a radius of 0.2 units.\n\n- Shots cannot ever deviate from the inner reticle while on the ground.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while in the air is 8.0 degrees.\n\n- The outer reticle immediately expands after jumping. After 40 frames, the outer reticle will start shrinking, and will finish shrinking after 70 frames.\n\n- When jumping, the chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle is immediately set to 50%.\n\n- Shots initially travel straight at a rate of 1.4 units per frame for 11 frames. Shots travel straight for 15.4 distance units.\nAfter that, the shot's velocity is set to 1.3426 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 1.3426 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight).

Paired with the Suction Bomb sub weapon, you can send a cold chill through the other team's battle plan and blast them from afar. Top it all off with a frosty beverage from the Tacticooler, and this is one loadout that can send shivers down your spineâ€“if you're unlucky enough to be on the other team!\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- Promotional image of the Splatlands Collection - Barazushi weapons\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Rapid_Blaster_Pro_WNT-R_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nPromotional video (link to file)\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:Splatoon_3_Rapid_Blaster_Pro_all_versions_comparison.mp4\n\n\nThe difference between the three versions of the Rapid Blaster Pro: The Rapid Blaster Pro Deco is the only one whose lights do not illuminate when fired.
