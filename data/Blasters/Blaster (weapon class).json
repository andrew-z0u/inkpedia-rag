  "content": "Blasters are one of the main weapon classes in the Splatoon series.\n\nBlasters are fully-automatic weapons that fire large globs of ink that travel forward and conclude their path with an explosion. They typically have a relatively low fire rate and high ink consumption compared to many other weapons.\n\n- 1 Classification\n\n- 2 List of blasters\n\n2.1 Special blasters\n\n- 2.1 Special blasters\n\n- 3 Sets\n\n- 4 Animations\n\n4.1 Splatoon\n4.2 Splatoon 2\n4.3 Splatoon 3\n\n- 4.1 Splatoon\n\n- 4.2 Splatoon 2\n\n- 4.3 Splatoon 3\n\n- 5 Quotes\n\n5.1 Splatoon 3\n\n- 5.1 Splatoon 3\n\n- 6 Gallery\n\n6.1 SplatNet icons\n6.2 2D icons\n6.3 Art\n6.4 Promotional renders for Splatoon 2\n6.5 Promotional renders for Splatoon 3\n6.6 Tableturf Battle cards for Splatoon 3\n\n- 6.1 SplatNet icons\n\n- 6.2 2D icons\n\n- 6.3 Art\n\n- 6.4 Promotional renders for Splatoon 2\n\n- 6.5 Promotional renders for Splatoon 3\n\n- 6.6 Tableturf Battle cards for Splatoon 3\n\n- 7 Trivia\n\n7.1 Splatoon\n7.2 Splatoon 2\n7.3 Splatoon 3\n\n- 7.1 Splatoon\n\n- 7.2 Splatoon 2\n\n- 7.3 Splatoon 3\n\n- 8 Names in other languages\n\n- 9 References\n\n- 2.1 Special blasters\n\n- 4.1 Splatoon\n\n- 4.2 Splatoon 2\n\n- 4.3 Splatoon 3\n\n- 5.1 Splatoon 3\n\n- 6.1 SplatNet icons\n\n- 6.2 2D icons\n\n- 6.3 Art\n\n- 6.4 Promotional renders for Splatoon 2\n\n- 6.5 Promotional renders for Splatoon 3\n\n- 6.6 Tableturf Battle cards for Splatoon 3\n\n- 7.1 Splatoon\n\n- 7.2 Splatoon 2\n\n- 7.3 Splatoon 3\n\nWhile blasters have been in the Splatoon series since Splatoon, games prior to Splatoon 3 classified them as shooters because the two classes share a few technical characteristics.

blasters are only available outside of battles as part of other modes:\n\nVictory:\n\n- Inkling girl: Jumps while waving her arms, then thrusts the weapon out.\n\n- Inkling boy: Jumps while swinging his weapon, does a fist pump with both his arms, then throws the weapon in the air, making it spin, catches it with the other hand and holds it across the chest.\n\nDefeat:\n\n- Both genders put their hands above their head before falling onto their knees in despair, hitting the floor with the hand that holds the weapon while crying.\n\nIn Ammo Knights (Clicking ):\n\n- Both genders hold the weapon high, then lowers it, poses like they are shooting, then looks behind the weapon, and returns to idle pose.\n\nSpawning in before match starts:\n\n- Both Inklings and Octolings point their weapon down at a 45-degree angle after shaking off their excess ink.\n\nVictory:\n\n- Inkling girl: Jumps up and down twice joyfully, then spins around and strikes a pose while holding the weapon upwards.\n\n- Inkling boy: Jumps up and thrusts his left fist forward before raising it over his chest while holding his weapon downward.\n\n- Octoling girl: Winces happily before twirling her weapon and ending it pointing upwards at an angle, and she strikes a pose by having her left hand on her hip.\n\n- Octoling boy: Similar to the Octoling girl, but stands up straight with a proud expression.\n\nDefeat:\n\n- Inkling girl: Stamps her feet on the ground, disappointed.\n\n- Inkling boy: Sits down on the ground and holds his head in frustration.\n\n- Octoling girl: Falls down to the ground, dropping her weapon in front of her, then turns her head away in anger.\n\n- Octoling boy: Similar to the Inkling boy, but lays his weapon behind him and puts his right arm on his right knee.\n\nIn Ammo Knights (Clicking ):\n\n- Inklings: Raises and lowers their weapon, looking it over, gets into a shooting stance, then looks down the weapon from behind.\n\n- Octolings: Looks over their weapon from the side and back, bends over slightly, and aims around before sighing.\n\nSpawner pose:\n\n- All styles: Throws their weapon above before catching it and pointing it down.\n\nVictory:\n\n- Flip Out: Throws the weapon into the air, flips backwards along the ground, then catches it, turns backwards, and poses with it in their arms.\n\n- Reppin' Inkopolis: The player jumps for joy three times, then points their weapon into the air with a smile.\n\n- The Square Show-Off: The player jumps for joy twice, before spinning on the third jump and pointing their weapon upwards and placing their left fist on their hip.\n\nIn Ammo Knights (Clicking ):\n\n- Inklings: The player will look down at their weapon and feel the weight of it, throwing it in the air and catching it before getting into a shooting pose and looking to their right.\n\n- Octolings: The player will look down at their weapon and look it over, feeling the weight of it before aiming and slowly going from their left to right.\n\n- Blaster\n\n- Custom Blaster\n\n- Range Blaster\n\n- Custom Range Blaster\n\n- Grim Range Blaster\n\n- Rapid Blaster\n\n- Rapid Blaster Deco\n\n- Rapid
