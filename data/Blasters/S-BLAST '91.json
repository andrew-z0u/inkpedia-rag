    "What a difference a year makes! The S-BLAST '91 comes in a different colorway than the S-BLAST '92 — not to mention it has an entirely new loadout to play with! Or is it an \"old\" loadout, since it's technically an earlier model of S-BLAST? Either way, you now have Burst Bombs to help make up for the relatively slow fire rate of your main. Find yourself in a tight spot? It's nice to have the Booyah Bomb special in your back pocket. Create a little space, and then push forward with your team! Burst Bombs... Booyah Bombs... I guess you could say this set is \"the bomb\" overall! Or... you don't have to say that. I... actually can't believe I just said it...",

    "- As opposed to the S-BLAST '92, the S-BLAST '91 has no real-world equivalent. While its shape is based on the Super Scope controller like the S-BLAST '92, its color scheme is based on the North American Super Nintendo Entertainment System console, which was gray with purple buttons. Similarly, the N-ZAP '83 is not based on an actual version of the NES Zapper, but is rather colored to look like the Japanese Famicom."
