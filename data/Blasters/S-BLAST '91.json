    "- As opposed to the S-BLAST '92, the S-BLAST '91 has no real-world equivalent. While its shape is based on the Super Scope controller like the S-BLAST '92, its color scheme is based on the North American Super Nintendo Entertainment System console, which was gray with purple buttons. Similarly, the N-ZAP '83 is not based on an actual version of the NES Zapper, but is rather colored to look like the Japanese Famicom.",
    "S-BLAST '91 is a shortened form of Super Blaster 1991. Super refers to the Super Scope. BLAST is short for blaster, the weapon class it belongs to. 91 is based on 1991, the year the Super Nintendo Entertainment System was released in North America."
