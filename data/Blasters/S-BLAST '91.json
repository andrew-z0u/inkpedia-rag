The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The ink consumption is 9.5% per shot, allowing the user to fire 10 shots on a full ink tank.\n\n- When firing continuously, it shoots a bullet every 55 frames (1.09 shots per second).\n\n- When firing from humanoid form, the first shot takes 14 frames to come out. When firing from swim form, the first shot takes 24 frames to come out.\n\n- The interval between firing the weapon and being able to enter swim form or use a sub weapon is 26 frames.\n\n- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.04 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 60 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Shots cannot ever deviate from the inner reticle while on the ground.\n\n- The damage on direct hit is 125.\n\n- Targets within 1.0 units of the explosion center always take 70 damage. Targets outside of this radius but inside the full blast radius of 2.0 units will take between 70 and 50 damage, depending on how close to the center they are.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with players has a radius of 0.2 units.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with the environment has a radius of 0.2 units.\n\n- Shots cannot ever deviate from the inner reticle.\n\n- Shots initially travel straight at a rate of 1.7 units per frame for 7 frames. Shots travel straight for 11.9 distance units.\nAfter that, the shot's velocity is set to 1.65 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 1.65 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- The bullet explodes 11 frames after being fired, covering a total distance of about 14.54 units.\nThis number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n- This number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 1.65 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight).

Shots travel straight for 6.44 distance units.\nAfter that, the shot's velocity is set to 0.9 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight).

Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- This number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n[1]\n\n- ▲ Increased the radius of the 50.0-damage explosion for long flight-range shots by about 11%: 1.8 units → 2 units.\n\n- ▲ Reduced the continuous fire interval by about 1/12th of a second: 60 frames → 55 frames.\n\n- ▼ Points to fill special gauge: 190 → 200.\n\n- ▼ Increased the amount of ink consumed by approximately 11%: 8.5% → 9.5%.\n\n- ▼ Increased the amount of time between firing and becoming able to act again by approximately 1/20th of a second: 23 frames → 26 frames.\n\nWhat a difference a year makes! The S-BLAST '91 comes in a different colorway than the S-BLAST '92 — not to mention it has an entirely new loadout to play with! Or is it an \"old\" loadout, since it's technically an earlier model of S-BLAST? Either way, you now have Burst Bombs to help make up for the relatively slow fire rate of your main. Find yourself in a tight spot? It's nice to have the Booyah Bomb special in your back pocket. Create a little space, and then push forward with your team! Burst Bombs... Booyah Bombs... I guess you could say this set is \"the bomb\" overall! Or... you don't have to say that. I... actually can't believe I just said it...\n\n- Promotional render\n\n- 2D Icon\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the S-BLAST '91\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_S-BLAST_%2791_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nModel of the S-BLAST '91 rotating (link to file)\n\nFor competitive tips about the S-BLAST '91\n\n- As opposed to the S-BLAST '92, the S-BLAST '91 has no real-world equivalent. While its shape is based on the Super Scope controller like the S-BLAST '92, its color scheme is based on the North American Super Nintendo Entertainment System console, which was gray with purple buttons. Similarly, the N-ZAP '83 is not based on an actual version of the NES Zapper, but is rather colored to look like the Japanese Famicom.\n\nS-BLAST '91 is a shortened form of Super Blaster 1991. Super refers to the Super Scope. BLAST is short for blaster, the weapon class it belongs to. 91 is based on 1991, the year the Super Nintendo Entertainment System was released in North America."
