    "The Order Blaster is a blaster in Splatoon 3 that is exclusively used in Side Order.",
    "The Order Blaster has a minimalist appearance, with a single white molded piece for the barrel and handle of the weapon, as well as metallic silver front and back balls. Its appearance is similar to that of a Luna Blaster. When firing, ring-shaped holograms manifest around the nozzle and base of the blaster.",
    "The Order Blaster is a weapon unlocked in Side Order, and is part of Murch's Palette. Its base set consists of Curling Bombs and Wave Breaker. However, this can be changed in the Spire of Order by using a vending machine.",
    "It has lower stats in comparison to the Luna Blaster, with a slower fire rate, explosion damage, strafe speed, ink efficiency, range, and blast radius. However, this can be upgraded through color chips in the Spire of Order.",
