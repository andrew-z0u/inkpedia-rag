    "The Tenta Brella CRE-M is a main weapon in the Splatoon series. It is a Barazushi-branded variant of the the Tenta Brella from the Splatlands Collection and features a different sub and special weapon.",
    "The Tenta Brella CRE-M makes its first appearance in Splatoon 3 with identical stats to the Tenta Brella.",
    "[1]",
    "It takes a smooth operator to use a brella, and now with the Tenta Brella CRE-M, Barazushi has created a model that lives up to that smooth standard in a soft-toned package. As with all brellas, your inking power comes at the expense of firing speed, so make good use of the Toxic Mist sub and Super Chump special to accessorize your attack plan. I can strongly recommend this set to team players who don't mind shielding their allies as needed and leaping into the fray as opportunities present themselves!",
