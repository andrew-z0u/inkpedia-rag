However, it has a more plain style, being colored mainly in gray and beige. Two black Barazushi logos are on either side of the muzzle on the canopy, and two orange straps with the Barazushi branding are attached with karabiners to the bars. Unlike the Tenta Brella, no part of the canopy change color to match the user's ink.\n\nThe Tenta Brella CRE-M makes its first appearance in Splatoon 3 with identical stats to the Tenta Brella.\n\n- The Tenta Brella CRE-M is a heavyweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 15. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The Tenta Brella CRE-M has a canopy with 700 HP, and regenerates 0.5 HP per frame (30 HP per second) when the canopy is not active and not destroyed.\nBrella canopies have different incoming damage multipliers for each weapon type.\n\n- Brella canopies have different incoming damage multipliers for each weapon type.\n\n- The canopy does 30 damage on contact with a cooldown of 30 frames.\n\n- After firing, the canopy takes 45 frames to open.\n\n- The canopy takes 60 frames to launch once it is open (1 second).\nThe canopy initially travels at a speed of about 0.077 units per frame, and remains onstage for 6 seconds. During this time, all damage to the shield is multiplied by 0.6.\n\n- The canopy initially travels at a speed of about 0.077 units per frame, and remains onstage for 6 seconds.

During this time, all damage to the shield is multiplied by 0.6.\n\n- Ink consumption is 11% per shot, allowing the user to fire 9 times with a full ink tank.\n\n- Once the canopy is fully open, it consumes 60% of the ink tank per second, requiring 30% of the tank to release.\n\n- After firing, there is a 70 frame (1.17 second) cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\nAfter holding but not releasing the canopy, there is a 30 frame (0.5 second) cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\nAfter releasing the canopy, there is a 120 frame (2 second) cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- After holding but not releasing the canopy, there is a 30 frame (0.5 second) cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- After releasing the canopy, there is a 120 frame (2 second) cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- When firing from humanoid form, the first shot takes 10 frames to come out. When firing from swim form, the first shot takes 20 frames to come out.\n\n- After holding but not releasing the canopy, there is a 30 frame (0.5 second) cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- After releasing the canopy, there is a 120 frame (2 second) cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- The time between consecutive shots is 52 frames.\n\n- The time between firing the weapon and being able to use a sub or enter swim form is 40 frames.\n\n- The movement speed while firing is 0.05 units per frame.\n\n- The movement speed while shielding is 0.04 units per frame.\n\n- Each pellet has a base damage of 17.\n\n- Pellets do not lose damage if they are in the air too long.\n\n- The maximum damage that can be dealt to a single target per shot is 119.\nIt takes 7 pellets at 17 damage to deal 119 damage.\n\n- It takes 7 pellets at 17 damage to deal 119 damage.\n\n- It takes 7 pellets at 17 damage to deal 119 damage.\n\n- The centermost pellet's hitbox has a radius of 0.2 units.\nAll other pellets' hitboxes have a radius of 0.1 units.\n\n- All other pellets' hitboxes have a radius of 0.1 units.\n\n- All other pellets' hitboxes have a radius of 0.1 units.\n\n- The Tenta Brella CRE-M fires 13 pellets per shot.\n\n- Pellets fly straight at 2.4 units per frame for 4 frames, covering a distance of 9.6 units.\nAfter that, the speed of the pellets is set to 2.3135 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and they lose 36% of their speed every frame (including the first frame after they stop traveling straight). Once the velocity decreases below a certain threshold, they will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- After that, the speed of the pellets is set to 2.3135 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and they lose 36% of their speed every frame (including the first frame after they stop traveling straight). Once the velocity decreases below a certain threshold, they will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- The effective range is about 13.47 units.\nThis number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n- This number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n- After that, the speed of the pellets is set to 2.3135 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and they lose 36% of their speed every frame (including the first frame after they stop traveling straight).

As with all brellas, your inking power comes at the expense of firing speed, so make good use of the Toxic Mist sub and Super Chump special to accessorize your attack plan. I can strongly recommend this set to team players who don't mind shielding their allies as needed and leaping into the fray as opportunities present themselves!\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- Promotional image of the Splatlands Collection - Barazushi weapons, with the Tenta Brella CRE-M on the lower right.\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Tenta_Brella_CRE-M_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nPromotional video (link to file)\n\nThe suffix \"CRE-M\" is a stylized spelling of the word cream."
