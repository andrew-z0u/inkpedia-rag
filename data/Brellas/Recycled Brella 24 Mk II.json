The brown parts, however, appear smoother and more caramel-toned than the Bamboozler 14 it is based on. The canopy itself features a coat of arms slightly reminiscent of Cuttlefish, with two kinds of letters inscribed left and right, and a circular symbol around the center, similar to the circle forming the Cuttlefish logo. The addition of the Cuttlefish coat of arms on the veil probably replaces the traditional sticker, such as that found on the Bamboozler 14 Mk II or III.\n\nThe Recycled Brella 24 Mk II made its debut in the Sizzle Season 2024.
