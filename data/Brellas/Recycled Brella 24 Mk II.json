    "The Recycled Brella 24 Mk II is a main weapon in Splatoon 3. It is a Cuttlegear-stamped version of the Recycled Brella 24 Mk I.",
    "The Recycled Brella 24 Mk II takes up the colors of its distant cousin, the Bamboozler 14 Mk III, i.e. a brown color on the body, but a purple cap, not pink. The brown parts, however, appear smoother and more caramel-toned than the Bamboozler 14 it is based on. The canopy itself features a coat of arms slightly reminiscent of Cuttlefish, with two kinds of letters inscribed left and right, and a circular symbol around the center, similar to the circle forming the Cuttlefish logo. The addition of the Cuttlefish coat of arms on the veil probably replaces the traditional sticker, such as that found on the Bamboozler 14 Mk II or III.",
    "The Recycled Brella 24 Mk II made its debut in the Sizzle Season 2024. Its kit consists of Toxic Mist and Triple Splashdown.",

    "- Where the appearance of the first model of the Recycled Brella 24, the \"Mk I\", was similar to that of traditional Bamboozler, and could suggest a collaboration between the brellas brand Sorella and Ammo Knights (itself linked to Cuttlefish and his platoons), this is confirmed by the Recycled Brella 24 Mk II, which directly reproduces the colors of the Bamboozler 14 Mk III, as well as the symbols of Cuttlefish, and by extension, of the Squidbeak Splatoon, both old and new versions.",
    "Mk II denotes, in the same way as the Bamboozler 14 Mk II, that this is the second version of the weapon."
