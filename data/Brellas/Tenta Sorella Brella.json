Whether you're focused on attacking or defending, this setup should suit your style.\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- An official teaser image\n\nThe Tenta Sorella Brella was revealed on 16 May 2023 in the Sizzle Season 2023 trailer.[3] Its physical structure is the same as the original Tenta Brella, but its design has changed, with new neon yellow support beams on the shield's outside and Inkline logos on the weapon.

Now you'll be able to press forward with the brella and lay Ink Mines as you go. Spot an enemy? Flap that brella as hard as you can, and take 'em out! If a particularly slippery foe sneaks away, you've also got the Trizooka special in your arsenal. Near or far, it's got power and range aplenty. Clearly, this set has offensive oomph, but don't overlook the benefits of the brella's defense. If you can flip the switch from offense to defense on a whim, give it a try!\n\n- Promotional render\n\n- The top left card is for the Tenta Sorella Brella.\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Tenta Sorella Brella.\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Tenta_Sorella_Brella_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nModel of the Tenta Sorella Brella rotating (link to file)\n\n- The logo on the Tenta Sorella Brella's shelter is the logo of the gear brand Inkline, presumably the result of an in-universe cooperation between the two companies. This is appropriate since the Tenta Sorella Brella is made from a camping shelter and Inkline's gear is mostly camping-, climbing- or hiking-related.\n\n- Unlike the other secondary variants of brellas, the Tenta Sorella Brella does not have a unique pattern on its canopy. However, in Splatoon 3, the support beams are yellow instead of red."
