    "The Tenta Sorella Brella is a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3. It is a Sorella-branded version of the Tenta Brella and comes with a different sub weapon and special weapon.",
    "The Tenta Sorella Brella is nearly identical in appearance to the Tenta Brella. The only difference between the two is that the Tenta Sorella Brella has two white Inkline logos on the color-changing parts of the canopy facing the muzzle. In Splatoon 3, the rails supporting the canopy are also yellow instead of red.",
    "The Tenta Sorella Brella was released on 1 July 2018 at  00:00 UTC.[1] It comes with Splash Walls and the Curling-Bomb Launcher.",

    "The Tenta Sorella Brella was revealed on 16 May 2023 in the Sizzle Season 2023 trailer.[3] Its physical structure is the same as the original Tenta Brella, but its design has changed, with new neon yellow support beams on the shield's outside and Inkline logos on the weapon. Its kit consists of Ink Mines and Trizooka.",

    "- The logo on the Tenta Sorella Brella's shelter is the logo of the gear brand Inkline, presumably the result of an in-universe cooperation between the two companies. This is appropriate since the Tenta Sorella Brella is made from a camping shelter and Inkline's gear is mostly camping-, climbing- or hiking-related.",
    "- Unlike the other secondary variants of brellas, the Tenta Sorella Brella does not have a unique pattern on its canopy. However, in Splatoon 3, the support beams are yellow instead of red."
