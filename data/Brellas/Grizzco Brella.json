Unlike other brellas, this weapon has no canopy. Instead, holding down the  button fires continuously, similar to a Shooter or the Undercover Brella. The weapon has an unusually high firing rate for a brella weapon, having over double the firing rate of both the Splat Brella and Undercover Brella.\n\nThe Grizzco Brella is somewhat similar in appearance to the Splat Brella. The shield has been removed, revealing the metal poles usually covered by it. A small green and white lifesaver is strapped around the muzzle. Three yellow pill bottles with white caps and unknown contents are sticking out of the center pole.\n\nIn Splatoon 2, the Grizzco Brella is a rare weapon only available during Salmon Run wildcard rotations. It was first available on 15 October 2017 at 00:00 UTC.\n\n- The Grizzco Brella has no canopy.\n\n- Each shot consumes 2% of the ink tank's capacity, allowing the player to fire 50 shots before needing to refill the ink supply.\n\n- After firing, there is a 0.83 second cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- When initially firing the weapon in humanoid form, the shot takes 8 frames to come out.\nWhen firing from swim form, the shot takes 15 frames to come out.\n\n- When firing from swim form, the shot takes 15 frames to come out.\n\n- When firing continuously, it fires a round of pellets every 12 frames.\n\n- The interval between firing and when the player is able to enter swim form or use a sub weapon is 20 frames.\n\n- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.96 units per frame.\n\n- The Grizzco Brella fires 10 projectiles per shot. Each projectile deals 15 damage. A maximum of 4 projectiles per shot will damage the opponent, so the maximum possible damage per shot is 60.\n\n- The Grizzco Brella does not experience damage falloff.\n\n- Shots can deviate 5.0 degrees horizontally and 5.0 degrees vertically.\n\n- Shots initially travel straight at a rate of 40.0 units per frame for 2 frames. Shots travel straight for 80 distance units.\nAfter that, the projectile's velocity is set to 20.0 units if the projectile's velocity is not already lower than the listed value, and decreases further as it falls to the ground.\n\n- After that, the projectile's velocity is set to 20.0 units if the projectile's velocity is not already lower than the listed value, and decreases further as it falls to the ground.\n\n- When firing from swim form, the shot takes 15 frames to come out.\n\n- After that, the projectile's velocity is set to 20.0 units if the projectile's velocity is not already lower than the listed value, and decreases further as it falls to the ground.\n\nThe Grizzco Brella was available during the following wildcard rotations:\n\n- Early model of the Brella\n\n- A player holding the weapon after losing a shift\n\nThe Grizzco Brella returns in Splatoon 3, unchanged from Splatoon 2. It is once again exclusive to wildcard rotations in Salmon Run. It was first available on 19 November 2022 at 00:00 UTC.\n\n- The Grizzco Brella is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The Grizzco Brella has no canopy.\n\n- Ink consumption is 2% per shot, allowing the user to fire 50 times with a full ink tank.\n\n- After firing, there is a 20 frame (0.33 second) cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- When firing from humanoid form, the first shot takes 8 frames to come out. When firing from swim form, the first shot takes 15 frames to come out.\n\n- The time between consecutive shots is 12 frames.\n\n- The time between firing the weapon and being able to use a sub or enter swim form is 20 frames.\n\n- The movement speed while firing is 0.096 units per frame.\n\n- Each pellet has a base damage of 15.\n\n- Pellets do not lose damage if they are in the air too long.\n\n- The maximum damage that can be dealt to a single target per shot is 80.\nIt takes 6 pellets at 15 damage to deal 80 damage.\n\n- It takes 6 pellets at 15 damage to deal 80 damage.\n\n- It takes 6 pellets at 15 damage to deal 80 damage.\n\n- All pellets' hitboxes have a radius of 0.2 units.\n\n- The Grizzco Brella fires 10 pellets per shot.\n\n- Pellets fly straight at 4.0 units per frame for 2 frames, covering a distance of 8 units.\nAfter that, the speed of the pellets is set to 2.0 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and they lose 36% of their speed every frame (including the first frame after they stop traveling straight). Once the velocity decreases below a certain threshold, they will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- After that, the speed of the pellets is set to 2.0 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and they lose 36% of their speed every frame (including the first frame after they stop traveling straight). Once the velocity decreases below a certain threshold, they will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- The effective range is about 11.51 units.\nThis number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n- This number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n- After that, the speed of the pellets is set to 2.0 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and they lose 36% of their speed every frame (including the first frame after they stop traveling straight).

The placeholder cubes that act as its canopy model are visible.\n\n- Despite not having a canopy, the files for the Grizzco Brella do contain equivalent models to support having one, like other Brella weapons. Both of these models are shaped as small cubes, hidden inside the shaft of the brella, and are never visible or active during regular gameplay.\nThese models are necessary for the weapon to function, even though they are never actually used. The game crashes as soon as the weapon is loaded, if they are to ever be removed.\n\n- These models are necessary for the weapon to function, even though they are never actually used.
