This weapon came about after I made a breakthrough in my research and managed to create the ultimate weapon! Sadly, it never made it to mass production because the guys at the factory couldn't wrap their heads around my advanced schematics... So instead they just slapped some shiny bits on a standard brella and called it the Hero Brella Replica. Give it a swing!\n\n- Although the Hero Brella in Octo Canyon was usable immediately upon the game's launch, the Hero Brella Replica could not be bought at Ammo Knights after completing all missions with the Hero Brella until 12 August 2017 at 02:00 UTC when it and the Splat Brella were released."
