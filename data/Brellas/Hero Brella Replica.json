    "The Hero Brella Replica is a main weapon in Splatoon 2.",
    "The Hero Brella Replica is identical to the Level 1 Hero Brella. The shield is black and neon yellow with light blue beads and an Ammo Knights logo in white.",
    "The Hero Brella Replica is visually identical to the Level 1 Hero Brella but is simply a re-skinned Splat Brella. Therefore unlike the switchable sub weapons of the Hero Brella, it comes with Sprinkler and Ink Storm. To unlock the Hero Brella Replica, the player must complete every level in Octo Canyon using the Hero Brella, after which it becomes available for purchase at Ammo Knights.",
    "[1]",
    "- Although the Hero Brella in Octo Canyon was usable immediately upon the game's launch, the Hero Brella Replica could not be bought at Ammo Knights after completing all missions with the Hero Brella until 12 August 2017 at 02:00 UTC when it and the Splat Brella were released."
