  "content": "The Splat Brella is a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3.\n\nThe weapon's shots resemble that of a shotgun; it has wide spread and short range, but not as wide and short-ranged as a roller. The player can press and hold  to open the umbrella, which will shield the player from any attacks in the direction they are facing. If the player continues to hold  for about two seconds, the umbrella will separate from the weapon and fly forward, becoming a fast-moving shield that the player can use to penetrate enemy defenses. Once separated, the player will not be able to use the umbrella's opening function for a few seconds.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Splatoon 2\n\n2.1 Data\n2.2 Version history\n2.3 Quotes\n2.4 Gallery\n2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3 Splatoon 3\n\n3.1 Data\n3.2 Version history\n3.3 Quotes\n3.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n3.5 Gallery\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 3.5 Gallery\n\n- 4 Strategy\n\n- 5 Trivia\n\n- 6 Names in other languages\n\n- 7 References\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 3.5 Gallery\n\nIn Splatoon 2, the Splat Brella has a black handle with blue highlights with the Sorella logo on it.

It features a completely different fighting style than any other weapon type. You can scatter ink in front of you with ! But if you keep holding , your umbrella will open up, shielding you from enemy attacks! Furthermore, if you hold  even longer, you can launch the umbrella shield, and it'll zoom forward while blocking attacks! The Sprinkler sub weapon and the Ink Storm special further enhance your support capabilities. This is a great set for getting your head around the brella!\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- 2D art of the Splat Brella.\n\n- An Inkling holding the Splat Brella.\n\n- An open Splat Brella.\n\n- Another view of an open Splat Brella\n\n- An Inkling holding the Splat Brella.\n\n- An open and launched Splat Brella.\n\n- The Splat Brella in its \"Closed\" State.\n\n- The Splat Brella in its \"Opened\" State.\n\n- The Splat Brella in its \"Launched\" State.\n\n- An Inkling boy with a Splat Brella\n\nThe Splat Brella returns in Splatoon 3 with a new design and Sprinkler and Triple Inkstrike.

Let me explain. You can spray ink normally with . But if you HOLD , the brella will open like a shield! And if you hold  even longer, you'll launch the brella itself. It leaves a trail of ink, can damage enemies, and STILL protects you. It's a triple threat! Speaking of triples, this set also comes with the Triple Inkstrike and the Sprinkler sub, so I guess you could say it's got you covered.\n\n- Launched canopy of the Splat Brella\n\n- 3D art of an Inkling wielding the Splat Brella\n\n- An Octoling firing the Splat Brella\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the  Splat Brella\n\n- Unused early version of the Splat Brella's Tableturf Battle card.

This is probably due to a mistranslation since its original Japanese name lacks the Japanese equivalent of the \"Splat\" prefix (スプラ) Splat-branded weapons use.\n\n- This weapon was playable in Octo Canyon as the Hero Brella before it was playable online. Even completing all stages with it would not unlock the Hero Brella Replica until it was released online.\n\n- The Splat Brella was one of the weapons that were available to use in the Splatoon 3 Splatfest World Premiere.\n\n- In Splatoon 3, despite being made by the Sorella brand, the weapon bears a Foil logo on its handle.\n\n- If a player is splatted by the mobile shield, the splat message will say \"Squished by Splat Brella.\" This is also possible with the Tenta Brella."
