    "The Splat Brella is a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3.",
    "The weapon's shots resemble that of a shotgun; it has wide spread and short range, but not as wide and short-ranged as a roller. The player can press and hold  to open the umbrella, which will shield the player from any attacks in the direction they are facing. If the player continues to hold  for about two seconds, the umbrella will separate from the weapon and fly forward, becoming a fast-moving shield that the player can use to penetrate enemy defenses. Once separated, the player will not be able to use the umbrella's opening function for a few seconds.",
    "In Splatoon 2, the Splat Brella has a black handle with blue highlights with the Sorella logo on it. The canopy is red and white with sections that change color to match the user's ink. The canopy also has Sorella logos and stylized seahorse designs.",
    "In Splatoon 3, the weapon has a new design. The logo on the handle is replaced by the Foil logo and parts of the canopy that change color to match the user's ink has been changed to occupy most of the canopy, although the canopy still has Sorella logos (albeit in altered positions).",

    "For competitive tips about the Splat Brella",
    "- The Splat Brella is the only weapon with the \"Splat\" prefix not made by the Splat brand. This is probably due to a mistranslation since its original Japanese name lacks the Japanese equivalent of the \"Splat\" prefix (スプラ) Splat-branded weapons use.",
    "- This weapon was playable in Octo Canyon as the Hero Brella before it was playable online. Even completing all stages with it would not unlock the Hero Brella Replica until it was released online.",
    "- The Splat Brella was one of the weapons that were available to use in the Splatoon 3 Splatfest World Premiere.",
    "- In Splatoon 3, despite being made by the Sorella brand, the weapon bears a Foil logo on its handle.",
    "- If a player is splatted by the mobile shield, the splat message will say \"Squished by Splat Brella.\" This is also possible with the Tenta Brella."
