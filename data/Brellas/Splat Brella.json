    "The Splat Brella is a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3.",
    "The weapon's shots resemble that of a shotgun; it has wide spread and short range, but not as wide and short-ranged as a roller. The player can press and hold  to open the umbrella, which will shield the player from any attacks in the direction they are facing. If the player continues to hold  for about two seconds, the umbrella will separate from the weapon and fly forward, becoming a fast-moving shield that the player can use to penetrate enemy defenses. Once separated, the player will not be able to use the umbrella's opening function for a few seconds.",
    "In Splatoon 2, the Splat Brella has a black handle with blue highlights with the Sorella logo on it. The canopy is red and white with sections that change color to match the user's ink. The canopy also has Sorella logos and stylized seahorse designs.",
    "In Splatoon 3, the weapon has a new design. The logo on the handle is replaced by the Foil logo and parts of the canopy that change color to match the user's ink has been changed to occupy most of the canopy, although the canopy still has Sorella logos (albeit in altered positions).",
    "The Splat Brella was released on 12 August 2017 at  02:00 UTC. It comes with Sprinkler and Ink Storm.",
    "It appears in four Octo Expansion stations:",
    "[1]",
    "This here is the Splat Brella. It features a completely different fighting style than any other weapon type. You can scatter ink in front of you with ! But if you keep holding , your umbrella will open up, shielding you from enemy attacks! Furthermore, if you hold  even longer, you can launch the umbrella shield, and it'll zoom forward while blocking attacks! The Sprinkler sub weapon and the Ink Storm special further enhance your support capabilities. This is a great set for getting your head around the brella!",
    "The Splat Brella returns in Splatoon 3 with a new design and Sprinkler and Triple Inkstrike. It was first shown in a video demonstrating the brella class on the Japanese official website on 22 April 2022.",
    "It appears in two missions in Return of the Mammalians:",
    "[2]",
    "Umbrellas help you stay dry, but Splat Brellas do that and more - like coat the battlefield and any enemies in your path with ink! Let me explain. You can spray ink normally with . But if you HOLD , the brella will open like a shield! And if you hold  even longer, you'll launch the brella itself. It leaves a trail of ink, can damage enemies, and STILL protects you. It's a triple threat! Speaking of triples, this set also comes with the Triple Inkstrike and the Sprinkler sub, so I guess you could say it's got you covered.",
