However, the parts of the Tenta Camo's canopy that change color to match the user's ink have a camouflage pattern, and the other parts of the canopy are gray. The Sorella logo and warning labels are black, and the bars now match the player's ink. There is mesh with leaves in it strung around the bars.",
