The Order Brella Replica's stats, sub weapon, and special weapon are identical to those of the Splat Brella.\n\nTo unlock the Order Brella Replica, the player must complete Side Order with Marina's Palette.\n\n- The Order Brella Replica is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 12.5. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The Order Brella Replica has a canopy with 500 HP, and regenerates 2.5 HP per frame (150 HP per second) when the canopy is not active and not destroyed.\nBrella canopies have different incoming damage multipliers for each weapon type.\n\n- Brella canopies have different incoming damage multipliers for each weapon type.\n\n- The canopy does 30 damage on contact with a cooldown of 30 frames.\n\n- After firing, the canopy takes 12 frames to open.\n\n- The canopy takes 110 frames to launch once it is open (1.83 seconds).\nThe canopy initially travels at a speed of about 0.132 units per frame, and remains onstage for 5 seconds. During this time, all damage to the shield is multiplied by 0.5.\n\n- The canopy initially travels at a speed of about 0.132 units per frame, and remains onstage for 5 seconds.

During this time, all damage to the shield is multiplied by 0.5.\n\n- Ink consumption is 5.5% per shot, allowing the user to fire 18 times with a full ink tank.\n\n- Once the canopy is fully open, it consumes 20% of the ink tank per second, requiring 30% of the tank to release.\n\n- After firing, there is a 60 frame (1 second) cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\nAfter holding but not releasing the canopy, there is a 20 frame (0.33 second) cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\nAfter releasing the canopy, there is a 120 frame (2 second) cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- After holding but not releasing the canopy, there is a 20 frame (0.33 second) cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- After releasing the canopy, there is a 120 frame (2 second) cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- When firing from humanoid form, the first shot takes 8 frames to come out. When firing from swim form, the first shot takes 15 frames to come out.\n\n- After holding but not releasing the canopy, there is a 20 frame (0.33 second) cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- After releasing the canopy, there is a 120 frame (2 second) cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- The time between consecutive shots is 30 frames.\n\n- The time between firing the weapon and being able to use a sub or enter swim form is 20 frames.\n\n- The movement speed while firing is 0.065 units per frame.\n\n- The movement speed while shielding is 0.055 units per frame.\n\n- Each pellet has a base damage of 16.2 and minimum damage of 10.8.\n\n- If a pellet is in the air for more than 8 frames after being fired, it will lose about 0.34 damage every frame until it reaches 10.8 damage at frame 24.\n\n- The maximum damage that can be dealt to a single target per shot is 81.\nIt takes 5 pellets at 16.2 damage to deal 81 damage.\n\n- It takes 5 pellets at 16.2 damage to deal 81 damage.\n\n- It takes 5 pellets at 16.2 damage to deal 81 damage.\n\n- The centermost pellet's hitbox has a radius of 0.2 units.\nAll other pellets' hitboxes have a radius of 0.1 units.\n\n- All other pellets' hitboxes have a radius of 0.1 units.\n\n- All other pellets' hitboxes have a radius of 0.1 units.\n\n- The Order Brella Replica fires 11 pellets per shot.\n\n- Pellets fly straight at 2.6 units per frame for 3 frames, covering a distance of 7.8 units.\nAfter that, the speed of the pellets is set to 1.652 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and they lose 36% of their speed every frame (including the first frame after they stop traveling straight). Once the velocity decreases below a certain threshold, they will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- After that, the speed of the pellets is set to 1.652 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and they lose 36% of their speed every frame (including the first frame after they stop traveling straight). Once the velocity decreases below a certain threshold, they will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- The effective range is about 10.62 units.\nThis number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n- This number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n- After that, the speed of the pellets is set to 1.652 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and they lose 36% of their speed every frame (including the first frame after they stop traveling straight).
