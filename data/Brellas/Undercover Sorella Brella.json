Not me though. I can easily tell them apart.  Anyway, this weapon offers the same sneaky play style, now paired with the Torpedo sub. Cover blown? Just toss one of these and disappear again. It's spycraft 101. And here's another top secret tip. If you set up a Splattercolor Screen on turf covered with enemy ink, it'll reveal the position of any enemy swimming in said ink. Neat, huh? I recommend this set for anyone who likes to pretend they're the hero in a spy movie from time to time. And that's everyone, not just me, right?\n\n- Promotional render\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Undercover Sorella Brella.\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Undercover_Sorella_Brella_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nModel of the Undercover Sorella Brella rotating (link to file)\n\nFor competitive tips about the Undercover Sorella Brella"
