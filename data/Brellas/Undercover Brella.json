    "The Undercover Brella is a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3.",
    "The Undercover Brella is a brella that can be fired in rapid succession while its semi-transparent shield is open. The shield will open after the first shot fires if the user is holding down the trigger. The shield cannot be launched, and has the second lowest durability in its class.",
    "A minimum of three shots are needed to splat opponents with the Undercover Brella. Opponents who touch the shield will take 15 damage, which is half the damage taken from touching the shield of a Splat Brella or Tenta Brella, and 75% of the damage taken from touching the shield of a Recycled Brella. After splatting an opponent or assisting a teammate in splatting an opponent, the umbrella canopy instantly reappears if it had been destroyed, or is restored to maximum durability if it was still functional.",
    "The Undercover Brella looks like an ordinary black umbrella. The brown handle appears to be made of whangee, and the main shaft changes color to match the user's ink. The shield is black and semi-transparent with black beads at the end of the ribs and a brown-and-gold muzzle on top.",
    "The Undercover Brella was announced[1] on 21 November 2017 as a part of the 2.0.0 update. It was released on 30 December 2017 at  02:00 UTC.[2] It comes with Ink Mine and Splashdown.",

    "- Holding the Undercover Brella",
    "- Firing the Undercover Brella with its protective canopy open.",
    "- An Octoling (bottom left) holds the Undercover Brella.",
    "The Undercover Brella returns in Splatoon 3 and has nearly identical stats to Splatoon 2, with the only difference being its special point requirement being raised from 150p to 180p. Its kit now has Ink Mines and the Reefslider.",
    "It appears in one mission in Return of the Mammalians:",
    "- 0103 Splat You on the Flip Side",
    "[5]",
    "- The third Inkling is holding the Undercover Brella.",
    "- 2D icon",
    "- Tableturf Battle card art",
    "- The Undercover Brella resembles the umbrella seen in the Kingsman: The Secret Service movie, that can shoot and protect, indicated by its name.",
    "- The Undercover Brella functions similarly to an automatic shotgun.",
    "- Prior to version 4.1.0 of Splatoon 2, Undercover Brella had the potential to deal 7 damage, which was the lowest possible damage output in the game.",
    "- In Splatoon 2, the Undercover Brella is tied with the Inkbrush for the lowest base special cost, at 150p, being the cheapest special in the entire Splatoon series.",
    "- Unlike the other brellas, the Undercover Brella does not consume more ink while being held open than if it stays closed.",
    "- In the Splatoon 3 Return of the Mammalians trailer[6], the Undercover Brella was seen not taking damage from the Splat Roller's attacks. This is potentially because the effect had not yet been programmed into the game.",
    "\"Undercover\" is a figurative term used in covert operations when a person or group is operating under a cover, obfuscating their true identities or allegiances; this befits the spy-based theming of the Undercover Brella often described by Sheldon and the Squid Research Lab. It can also be more literally interpreted as \"under cover\", in the sense of sheltering behind an object that protects from enemy fire (in this case, the brella's canopy)."
