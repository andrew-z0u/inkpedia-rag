    "The Recycled Brella 24 Mk I is a main weapon in Splatoon 3, made by Sorella. It is a brella that fires off and recovers its shield faster than the other weapons in the class.",
    "The Recycled Brella 24 Mk I resembles a traditional Japanese oil-paper umbrella, with the main shield being made of thin paper. The handle made from red bamboo and the circular turquoise cap are similar to the Bamboozler 14 weapons. The shield changes color to match the user's ink.",
    "This weapon's design could be a nod to members of the New Squidbeak Splatoon: it resembles the umbrella Marie uses in Octo Canyon and reuses parts of a Bamboozler 14, Cuttlefish's signature weapon. Its name formatting also matches that of the Bamboozler 14 Mk I in various languages.",
    "The Recycled Brella 24 Mk I was revealed in the Fresh Season 2024 trailer on 13 February 2024 and released on 1 March 2024. Its kit consists of Angle Shooter and Big Bubbler.",
    "Like all brellas, the Recycled Brella 24 Mk I fires several droplets of ink, but the dispersion of its shots is much less wide, offering exceptional accuracy and increased damage, at the cost of a flimsy shield. The shield itself deploys, launches, and regenerates faster than other brellas, compensating for its fragility.",

    "- The Recycled Brella Mk I is not included in Return of the Mammalians due to it being added post-release.",
    "- The nori seaweed that forms the canopy of the brella is most commonly used as a wrap for sushi and onigiri.",
    "- The weapon's name has been misspelled three times in official media: twice by the Splatoon NA Twitter account as \"Recycle Brella 24 Mk 1\"[2][3] and by the Tableturf Battle card as \"Recycle Brella 24 Mk I\".",
    "- Although officially created by Sorella, the emblematic brellas brand, the Recycled Brella 24 Mk I may well have been created in collaboration with Ammo Knights, given its strong resemblance to the Bamboozler 14. Moreover, the brella's names in several languages, including English, indicate that it is a recycling of another weapon, probably the Bamboozler. However, nothing has been directly confirmed.",
    "- When released on Splatoon 3, the Recycled Brella 24 Mk I originally had the same number of shots before the ink tank ran out as the Bamboozler 14: 14.",
    "- The Recycled Brella 24 Mk I appeared in the 2025 New Year's video on Splatoon NA's X account.",
    "\"Recycled\" refer to the weapon's appearance being similar to a Bamboozler 14. \"Recycled\" could also be in reference to the stated environmentally-friendly composition of the canopy, or its fast shield regeneration. \"24\" is a reference to the year in which the weapon was created: 2024. Finally, like the Bamboozler 14 Mk I, \"Mk I\" indicates that this is the first version of the weapon."
