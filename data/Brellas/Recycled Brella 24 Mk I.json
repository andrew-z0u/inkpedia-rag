The handle made from red bamboo and the circular turquoise cap are similar to the Bamboozler 14 weapons. The shield changes color to match the user's ink.\n\nThis weapon's design could be a nod to members of the New Squidbeak Splatoon: it resembles the umbrella Marie uses in Octo Canyon and reuses parts of a Bamboozler 14, Cuttlefish's signature weapon. Its name formatting also matches that of the Bamboozler 14 Mk I in various languages.\n\nThe Recycled Brella 24 Mk I was revealed in the Fresh Season 2024 trailer on 13 February 2024 and released on 1 March 2024. Its kit consists of Angle Shooter and Big Bubbler.\n\nLike all brellas, the Recycled Brella 24 Mk I fires several droplets of ink, but the dispersion of its shots is much less wide, offering exceptional accuracy and increased damage, at the cost of a flimsy shield. The shield itself deploys, launches, and regenerates faster than other brellas, compensating for its fragility.\n\n- The Recycled Brella 24 Mk I is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 14.5. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The Recycled Brella 24 Mk I has a canopy with 150 HP, and regenerates 0.5 HP per frame (30 HP per second) when the canopy is not active and not destroyed.\nBrella canopies have different incoming damage multipliers for each weapon type.\n\n- Brella canopies have different incoming damage multipliers for each weapon type.\n\n- The canopy does 20 damage on contact with a cooldown of 30 frames.\n\n- After firing, the canopy takes 10 frames to open.\n\n- The canopy takes 30 frames to launch once it is open (0.5 seconds).\nThe canopy initially travels at a speed of about 0.15 units per frame, and remains onstage for 2.83 seconds. During this time, all damage to the shield is multiplied by 0.6.\n\n- The canopy initially travels at a speed of about 0.15 units per frame, and remains onstage for 2.83 seconds.

During this time, all damage to the shield is multiplied by 0.6.\n\n- Ink consumption is 6% per shot, allowing the user to fire 16 times with a full ink tank.\n\n- Once the canopy is fully open, it consumes 45% of the ink tank per second, requiring 15% of the tank to release.\n\n- After firing, there is a 50 frame (0.83 second) cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\nAfter holding but not releasing the canopy, there is a 20 frame (0.33 second) cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\nAfter releasing the canopy, there is a 55 frame (0.92 second) cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- After holding but not releasing the canopy, there is a 20 frame (0.33 second) cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- After releasing the canopy, there is a 55 frame (0.92 second) cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- When firing from humanoid form, the first shot takes 8 frames to come out. When firing from swim form, the first shot takes 15 frames to come out.\n\n- After holding but not releasing the canopy, there is a 20 frame (0.33 second) cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- After releasing the canopy, there is a 55 frame (0.92 second) cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- The time between consecutive shots is 35 frames.\n\n- The time between firing the weapon and being able to use a sub or enter swim form is 25 frames.\n\n- The movement speed while firing is 0.058 units per frame.\n\n- The movement speed while shielding is 0.05 units per frame.\n\n- Each pellet has a base damage of 15 and minimum damage of 10.\n\n- If a pellet is in the air for more than 8 frames after being fired, it will lose about 0.31 damage every frame until it reaches 10 damage at frame 24.\n\n- The maximum damage that can be dealt to a single target per shot is 90.\nIt takes 6 pellets at 15 damage to deal 90 damage.\n\n- It takes 6 pellets at 15 damage to deal 90 damage.\n\n- It takes 6 pellets at 15 damage to deal 90 damage.\n\n- The centermost pellet's hitbox has a radius of 0.2 units.\nAll other pellets' hitboxes have a radius of 0.1 units.\n\n- All other pellets' hitboxes have a radius of 0.1 units.\n\n- All other pellets' hitboxes have a radius of 0.1 units.\n\n- The Recycled Brella 24 Mk I fires 11 pellets per shot.\n\n- Pellets fly straight at 3.0 units per frame for 3 frames, covering a distance of 9 units.\nAfter that, the speed of the pellets is set to 2.0 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and they lose 36% of their speed every frame (including the first frame after they stop traveling straight). Once the velocity decreases below a certain threshold, they will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- After that, the speed of the pellets is set to 2.0 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and they lose 36% of their speed every frame (including the first frame after they stop traveling straight). Once the velocity decreases below a certain threshold, they will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- The effective range is about 12.37 units.\nThis number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n- This number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n- After that, the speed of the pellets is set to 2.0 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and they lose 36% of their speed every frame (including the first frame after they stop traveling straight).

It's made from paper stretched over a wood-and-bamboo framework. As you can imagine, that doesn't make for the sturdiest canopy, so it offers less protection than usual. But the brella is quick to launch and travels at a good clip when fired, making it better than usual as an offensive tool! Even better, direct hits from the main weapon really hurt! Distract your foes with a launched canopy and the Angle Shooter sub, then squeeze off a direct hit! Many brella users are uneasy about giving up their protection, but that's what the Big Bubbler special is for. When the ink starts to fly, it'll keep you safe! Probably! A brella centered around launching the canopy rather than hiding behind it takes some getting used to, but I highly recommend this to anyone who doesn't mind getting a bit wet!\n\nIts fast canopy release & cooldown is possible thanks to unique materials and crafting methods.\nThe canopy is primarily nori seaweed & is environmentally friendly, even when left scattered around the battlefield!\n\n- An Inkling wielding the Recycled Brella 24 Mk I.\n\n- Promotional render\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- Tableturf Battle card art.\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Recycled_Brella_24_Mk_I_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nModel of the Recycled Brella Mk I rotating (link to file)\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Recycled_Brella_24_Mk_I_demonstration.mp4\n\n\nWeapon demonstration video (link to file)\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_New_Year%27s_2025.mp4\n\n\nNew Year's video 2025 (link to file)\n\nFor competitive tips about the Recycled Brella 24 Mk I\n\n- The Recycled Brella Mk I is not included in Return of the Mammalians due to it being added post-release.\n\n- The nori seaweed that forms the canopy of the brella is most commonly used as a wrap for sushi and onigiri.\n\n- The weapon's name has been misspelled three times in official media: twice by the Splatoon NA Twitter account as \"Recycle Brella 24 Mk 1\"[2][3] and by the Tableturf Battle card as \"Recycle Brella 24 Mk I\".\n\n- Although officially created by Sorella, the emblematic brellas brand, the Recycled Brella 24 Mk I may well have been created in collaboration with Ammo Knights, given its strong resemblance to the Bamboozler 14. Moreover, the brella's names in several languages, including English, indicate that it is a recycling of another weapon, probably the Bamboozler. However, nothing has been directly confirmed.\n\n- When released on Splatoon 3, the Recycled Brella 24 Mk I originally had the same number of shots before the ink tank ran out as the Bamboozler 14: 14.\n\n- The Recycled Brella 24 Mk I appeared in the 2025 New Year's video on Splatoon NA's X account.\n\n\"Recycled\" refer to the weapon's appearance being similar to a Bamboozler 14. \"Recycled\" could also be in reference to the stated environmentally-friendly composition of the canopy, or its fast shield regeneration. \"24\" is a reference to the year in which the weapon was created: 2024. Finally, like the Bamboozler 14 Mk I, \"Mk I\" indicates that this is the first version of the weapon."
