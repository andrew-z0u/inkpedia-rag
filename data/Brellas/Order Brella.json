    "The Order Brella is a brella in Splatoon 3 that is exclusively used in Side Order.",
    "The Order Brella has a minimalist appearance, with a single white molded piece for the handle of the weapon, as well as a metallic silver canopy. Its appearance is similar to that of a Splat Brella. When firing, ring-shaped holograms manifest around the base of the Brella.",
    "The Order Brella is a weapon unlocked in Side Order, and is part of Marina's Palette. Its base set consists of Sprinklers and Ink Storm, notably identical to the Splat Brella's set in Splatoon 2. However, this can be changed in the Spire of Order by using a vending machine.",
    "It has lower stats in comparison to the Splat Brella, with a slower fire rate, strafe speed, ink efficiency, and range, but has higher contact damage and faster launch and cooldown time. However, this can be upgraded through color chips in the Spire of Order.",
