However, the Sorella Brella has white highlights on the handle, and most of the canopy changes color to match the user's ink, but in differing shades. The canopy itself has polka dots and fish designs on it instead of the Splat Brella's checkers and seahorse designs.\n\nIn Splatoon 3, the canopy received an updated design featuring a large black graphic in the middle of it, with borders in the same color as the user's ink. The fish on each side have been replaced with stylized designs of a pufferfish seen from the front, and the top and bottom of the canopy use Sorella branding. The muzzle, some parts of the handle and the tips of the canopy are also bright yellow.\n\n- Unfolded\n\n- Folded\n\nThe Sorella Brella was released on 31 March 2018 at 02:00 UTC.[1] It comes with Autobombs and the Splat-Bomb Launcher.\n\n- The Sorella Brella is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 125.

And the loadout's different too! Now you can fend off foes with the Autobomb sub before pushing forward with the brella. Here's a pro move: deploy the brella shield, and then fire up your Inkjet special to rain down ink to support your allies making a forward push behind it. This set is carefully crafted for players who have the skill and experience to use each component in a coordinated attack. I hope you'll give it a try!\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Sorella Brella.\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Sorella_Brella_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nModel of the Sorella Brella rotating (Link to file)\n\nFor competitive tips about the Sorella Brella\n\n- Before being officially announced, the Sorella Brella appeared in the Splatoon 2 version 3.0.0 preview section of the 8 March 2018 Nintendo Direct.[5]\n\n- According to the Oatmealdome data mine from August 2017, the Sorella Brella would have had Toxic Mist as the sub weapon.
