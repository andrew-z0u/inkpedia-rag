    "The Sorella Brella is a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3. It is a Sorella-branded version of the Splat Brella and comes with a different sub weapon and special weapon.",
    "The Sorella Brella is similar in appearance to the Splat Brella. However, the Sorella Brella has white highlights on the handle, and most of the canopy changes color to match the user's ink, but in differing shades. The canopy itself has polka dots and fish designs on it instead of the Splat Brella's checkers and seahorse designs.",
    "In Splatoon 3, the canopy received an updated design featuring a large black graphic in the middle of it, with borders in the same color as the user's ink. The fish on each side have been replaced with stylized designs of a pufferfish seen from the front, and the top and bottom of the canopy use Sorella branding. The muzzle, some parts of the handle and the tips of the canopy are also bright yellow.",
    "The Sorella Brella was released on 31 March 2018 at 02:00 UTC.[1] It comes with Autobombs and the Splat-Bomb Launcher.",
