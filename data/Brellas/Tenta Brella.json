    "The Tenta Brella is a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3.",
    "The Tenta Brella functions similarly to the standard Splat Brella but the shield is much larger and more durable. This means it can block more shots and leave a wider ink trail when launched.",
    "The Tenta Brella has a black handle that is shaped like a walking stick. The canopy is rectangular and has two dark green sections and two sections that change color to match the user's ink. In the center of the canopy is a black muzzle that connects to four red bars, each one supporting one of the canopy's corners. Below the muzzle is a white Sorella logo and some white warning labels.",
    "The Tenta Brella was announced during a Nintendo Direct on 13 September 2017. It was released on 30 September 2017 at  02:00 UTC.[1]\nIt comes with Squid Beakons and Bubble Blower.[2] In Salmon Run, the umbrella's shield breaks immediately after making contact with a Steel Eel.",
    "It appears in two Octo Expansion stations:",
    "[3]",
    "The Tenta Brella is...well, a big umbrella that looks like a camping tent! The Squid Beakon sub is perfect for pushing forward as you protect your teammates with the brella! The Bubble Blower allows you to support your teammates by inking out far and wide around them! This set is highly recommended for team-minded Inklings that want to lead their team to victory!",
    "The Tenta Brella returns in Splatoon 3 with Squid Beakon and Ink Vac with a slightly updated design.",
    "It appears in one mission in Return of the Mammalians:",
    "[4]",
    "The Tenta Brella is... well, a big umbrella. You'd be forgiven for thinking it looks like the sort of thing you could camp in. Because that's certainly one way of using this setup! Try placing a Squid Beakon, and then opening your Tenta Brella wide for your teammates to gather behind. And if the enemy is bringing major inkpower that can penetrate the brella? Fire up the Ink Vac, and send it right back at 'em! I hope I've made it clear that this loadout is for the ultimate team player - someone who wants to protect and support their team on the path to victory!",
    "The name Tenta Brella, as well as its Japanese name Camping Shelter, references the fact that it is designed after a dome tent camping shelter. Tenta Brella is also similar to Tenta Missiles or Tentatek, referencing the word \"tentacle\".",
