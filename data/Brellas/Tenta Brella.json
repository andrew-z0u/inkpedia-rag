    "The Tenta Brella is a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3.",
    "The Tenta Brella functions similarly to the standard Splat Brella but the shield is much larger and more durable. This means it can block more shots and leave a wider ink trail when launched.",
    "The Tenta Brella has a black handle that is shaped like a walking stick. The canopy is rectangular and has two dark green sections and two sections that change color to match the user's ink. In the center of the canopy is a black muzzle that connects to four red bars, each one supporting one of the canopy's corners. Below the muzzle is a white Sorella logo and some white warning labels.",
    "The Tenta Brella was announced during a Nintendo Direct on 13 September 2017. It was released on 30 September 2017 at  02:00 UTC.[1]\nIt comes with Squid Beakons and Bubble Blower.[2] In Salmon Run, the umbrella's shield breaks immediately after making contact with a Steel Eel.",

    "- The dome tent of the Tenta Brella is supplied in a collaboration with Inkline, as their logo appears on the Brella's clasp when it is closed. This is appropriate since Inkline's gear is mostly camping-, climbing- or hiking-related. This is further cemented in the design for the Tenta Sorella Brella, which has the logo appear as a pattern on the shelter and in the weapon icon.",
    "- The Tenta Brella was one of the weapons that were available to use in the Splatoon 3 Splatfest World Premiere.",
    "The name Tenta Brella, as well as its Japanese name Camping Shelter, references the fact that it is designed after a dome tent camping shelter. Tenta Brella is also similar to Tenta Missiles or Tentatek, referencing the word \"tentacle\"."
