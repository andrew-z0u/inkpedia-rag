You'd be forgiven for thinking it looks like the sort of thing you could camp in. Because that's certainly one way of using this setup! Try placing a Squid Beakon, and then opening your Tenta Brella wide for your teammates to gather behind. And if the enemy is bringing major inkpower that can penetrate the brella? Fire up the Ink Vac, and send it right back at 'em! I hope I've made it clear that this loadout is for the ultimate team player - someone who wants to protect and support their team on the path to victory!\n\n- Promotional render\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Tenta Brella.\n\n- Unused early version of the Tenta Brella's Tableturf Battle card.

This is appropriate since Inkline's gear is mostly camping-, climbing- or hiking-related. This is further cemented in the design for the Tenta Sorella Brella, which has the logo appear as a pattern on the shelter and in the weapon icon.\n\n- The Tenta Brella was one of the weapons that were available to use in the Splatoon 3 Splatfest World Premiere.\n\nThe name Tenta Brella, as well as its Japanese name Camping Shelter, references the fact that it is designed after a dome tent camping shelter. Tenta Brella is also similar to Tenta Missiles or Tentatek, referencing the word \"tentacle\"."
