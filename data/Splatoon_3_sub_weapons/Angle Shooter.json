The label wrapped around the Angle Shooter features the Nouveau logo and other  Inkling text. Like Point Sensor, enemies tagged by the Angle Shooter are encircled by a translucent black arrow and tied to members of the user's team with a line of the user's ink color, although each line is only visible to the member it leads to.\n\nThe following Return of the Mammalians level serves as a tutorial for the Angle Shooter:\n\n- 0513 Learn to Reflect, and This One Is in the Bank\n\nThe Angle Shooter is a fast-moving projectile that travels in a straight line and bounces off any surface except grating, leaving behind a large puddle of ink on each bounce, until it reaches its maximum travel distance or hits an enemy. The projectile briefly leaves behind a team-colored trail. Enemies directly hit by the Angle Shooter are damaged, and those that are hit or touch its lingering trail are marked.\n\nThe projectile is aimed and fired at a lower angle than the usual crosshair, making it somewhat unintuitive to aim directly, especially from below.\n\nWhen bouncing off of horizontal surfaces such as floors, the projectile's exit angle is much shallower than its entry angle - the projectile stays close to the floor for longer. This makes the projectile more likely to connect with an enemy following a bounce off the floor, and allows much more freedom with aiming from high up.\n\n- ▲ Initial velocity is about 20% faster, and flight range has been extended.\nVelocity: 5 units/frame → 6 units/frame.\nFlight range: 35 units → 42 units.\n\n- Velocity: 5 units/frame → 6 units/frame.\n\n- Flight range: 35 units → 42 units.\n\n- — The direct-hit sound effects for when an Angle Shooter hits an opponent and when it hits another physical object are now different.\n\n- — The Angle Shooter's direct-hit sound effect is now easier to hear from a distance.\n\n- Velocity: 5 units/frame → 6 units/frame.\n\n- Flight range: 35 units → 42 units.\n\n- ▲ Damage has been increased from 30.0 to 35.0.\n\n- ▲ The radius of ink coverage when striking terrain or opponents has been roughly doubled.\nTerrain: 0.65 units → 1.3 units.\nOpponents: 1 unit → 2 units.\n\n- Terrain: 0.65 units → 1.3 units.\n\n- Opponents: 1 unit → 2 units.\n\n- Terrain: 0.65 units → 1.3 units.\n\n- Opponents: 1 unit → 2 units.\n\n- ▲ Roughly doubled the radius of the ink splatter that occurs when it hits terrain: 1.3 units → 2.6 units.\n\n- ▲ Increased the damage dealt to opponents by direct hits from 35.0 to 40.0.\n\n- — Fixed an issue where the Angle Shooter occasionally ricocheted incorrectly when fired at terrain that isn't perfectly level.\n\n- ▲ Initial velocity is appoximately 5% faster, and flight distance has been extended.\nVelocity: 6 units/frame → 6.3 units/frame.\nFlight range: 42 units → 44.1 units.\n\n- Velocity: 6 units/frame → 6.3 units/frame.\n\n- Flight range: 42 units → 44.1 units.\n\n- Velocity: 6 units/frame → 6.3 units/frame.\n\n- Flight range: 42 units → 44.1 units.\n\nImagine bouncing an Angle Shooter off the walls of a narrow corridor, pinning down a rival. If they touch the line, they take damage... so while they hesitate, you pounce with your heavy main weapon and ink 'em up good! Take that, Gary! I mean... if your rival's name is Gary.\n\n- An Octoling throwing the Angle Shooter to tag an enemy\n\n- The trace left behind by the Angle Shooter as seen from the other team's perspective\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- The angle Shooter being used in Undertow Spillway\n\n- 3D Tableturf Battle artwork.\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Angle_Shooter_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nModel of the Angle Shooter rotating (link to file)\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Angle_Shooter_demonstration.mp4\n\n\nUsing the Angle Shooter (link to file)\n\nFor competitive tips about the Angle Shooter\n\n- In Return of the Mammalians the line left behind by Angle Shooter does 5 damage to enemies that touch it even without a direct hit despite the trail not doing any damage without direct hits in all other modes Angle Shooter is in.\n\nThe Angle Shooter's English name comes from the term \"angle shooting\", which describes behavior in gambling games that is not technically cheating, but considered unethical.\n\n- Point Sensor\n\n- Echolocator\n\n- Ink Mine\n\n- Wave Breaker"
