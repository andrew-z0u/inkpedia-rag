The base is simply a black tripod pole, while the satellite is more complex. The satellite has a metal backing with two red lights on top, and in Splatoon 2, one of the lights will stop blinking if someone who does not have Squid Beakon as their sub weapon Super Jumps to it. In front of the backing is a tube with a camera-like apparatus inside of the end. The tube makes a U-turn around its middle to face the backing. The entire satellite changes color to match the user's ink. Once deployed, the Squid Beakon's appearance is unchanged other than it spinning around.\n\n- Put Squid Beakons in places where they are less vulnerable to enemies, such as up high or behind obstacles.\n\n- Ink the area around the Squid Beakon so an arriving ally can hide immediately after landing.\n\n- If Squid Beakon is in a good spot, place a new one as soon as it is used.\n\n- A single player can only have up to three Squid Beakons in play at once; attempting to place a fourth will destroy the oldest of those currently active.\n\n- Like Sprinklers, Squid Beakons can be used as light shields in a pinch, taking some damage (120HP without opponent wearing object shredder) in place of the user.\nEven when not used as shields, the attention drawn by an unguarded Squid Beakon can be used to one's advantage for an ambush or escape. This is especially effective in Ranked Battles, since preventing enemy movement is a greater concern.\n\n- Even when not used as shields, the attention drawn by an unguarded Squid Beakon can be used to one's advantage for an ambush or escape. This is especially effective in Ranked Battles, since preventing enemy movement is a greater concern.\n\n- Squid Beakons can be used with the Krak-On Splat Roller to attack an enemy on a ledge above the user. To do this, place a Squid Beakon right next to their perch, Super Jump to it, then fling ink at them on the way down.\n\n- If there are Squid Beakons on the map, consider Super Jumping to those rather than a teammate, as they are usually placed in a safe location, and will hide your landing marker.\n\n- Squid Beakons can be seen on the map by either team, allowing the player to find hidden Squid Beakons or predict enemies' positions.\n\n- A Squid Beakon may be bait; it would be wise to keep an eye on its surroundings when destroying it.\n\n- Alternatively to destroying a Squid Beakon, one can wait in their ink near it and splat an opponent when they land. However, this may simply waste time if the Squid Beakon is never jumped to.\n\n- Beakons provide a location effect, enemy players near a friendly Squid Beakon will display on the map. This allows the user and their teammates to gain intel on the enemy players position in addtion to knowledge of if a enemy player is in the area before jumping to one.\n\n- Even when not used as shields, the attention drawn by an unguarded Squid Beakon can be used to one's advantage for an ambush or escape. This is especially effective in Ranked Battles, since preventing enemy movement is a greater concern.\n\nA player Super Jumping to a Squid Beakon will destroy it regardless of their sub weapon. A Squid Beakon can also be destroyed by dealing damage to it, which varies depending on the weapon used (listed below).\n\nDestroying a Squid Beakon varies between weapons: for instance, an Inkbrush can squish it in one hit (which normally does 20 damage to Inklings) but it takes a Splattershot Pro three shots (which deal 126 damage to Inklings).\n\n- Shooters and splatlings require the same amount of shots to destroy a Squid Beakon as they do to splat an Inkling.\n\n- Blasters take one direct hit to destroy a Squid Beakon. Using indirect hits, blasters need to do a total of 50 damage. Therefore, it takes one indirect shot for the regular Blaster, Range Blasters, and Luna Blasters and two indirect hits for the Rapid Blaster and Rapid Blaster Pro.\n\n- Rollers and brushes take approximately the same number of flings or flicks to destroy a Squid Beakon as to splat an Inkling. All rollers and brushes can squish a Squid Beakon in one hit.\n\n- Chargers, including the Bamboozlers, can destroy a Squid Beakon with one fully charged shot or two uncharged shots. Classic Squiffers and Splat Chargers can destroy it with a half charge and E-liter 3Ks can destroy it with a quarter charge.\n\n- Sloshers can destroy a Squid Beakon in one direct slosh or two indirect sloshes.\n\nAdditional information:\n\n- Two indirect Burst Bomb hits will destroy a Squid Beakon.\n\n- A Splash Wall placed on or very near the Squid Beakon will destroy it.\n\n- A Sprinkler will destroy a Squid Beakon in four drops.\n\n- Squid Beakons are unaffected by standing in enemy ink.\n\n[1]\n\n- Squid Beakon high-quality image.\n\n- The Squid Beakon in action at Blackbelly Skatepark.\n\n- The Squid Beakon icon that indicates that a Beakon has been deployed by the player or a teammate.\n\n- Promotional art with a Squid Beakon at the far right.\n\n- Concept art of various sub weapons, with the Squid Beakon at the lower left.\n\n- Early Squid Beakon\n\nThe Squid Beakon returns in Splatoon 2. A Squid Beakon can now be used up to two times if the first player to use it does not also have Squid Beakon as their sub weapon. The number of uses remaining is indicated by the number of circles on the Squid Beakon's icon on the map or the number of lights on the Squid Beakon itself.\n\n- ▼ When destroyed, shows indicator of the Super Jump player.\n\n- ▲ Ink consumption: 90% → 75%\n\n- ▲ Sub Power Up applies the effects of Quick Super Jump.\n\n- ▲ Made it so that the position of opponent players within the area of effect is displayed on all allies' turf maps.\n\n- ▲ Increased durability by roughly 20%.\n\n- Due to the above fix, damage dealt by certain attacks has also changed.\n▲ Decreased damage dealt by Sting Rays by roughly 58%.\n▲ Decreased damage dealt by Ink Storms by roughly 67%.\n▼ Increased damage dealt by Nozzlenose weapons by roughly 20%.\n▼ Increased damage dealt by Blaster weapons by roughly 20%.\n▼ Increased damage dealt by vertical swing attacks with Roller weapons by roughly 20%.\n\n- ▲ Decreased damage dealt by Sting Rays by roughly 58%.\n\n- ▲ Decreased damage dealt by Ink Storms by roughly 67%.\n\n- ▼ Increased damage dealt by Nozzlenose weapons by roughly 20%.\n\n- ▼ Increased damage dealt by Blaster weapons by roughly 20%.\n\n- ▼ Increased damage dealt by vertical swing attacks with Roller weapons by roughly 20%.\n\n- ▲ Decreased damage dealt by Sting Rays by roughly 58%.\n\n- ▲ Decreased damage dealt by Ink Storms by roughly 67%.\n\n- ▼ Increased damage dealt by Nozzlenose weapons by roughly 20%.\n\n- ▼ Increased damage dealt by Blaster weapons by roughly 20%.\n\n- ▼ Increased damage dealt by vertical swing attacks with Roller weapons by roughly 20%.\n\n- ▲ Each Squid Beakon can now be used twice when used by an ally who doesn't have a Squid Beakon equipped.\nNumber of uses left indicated by the number of circles on the Squid Beakon icon on the map or the number of lights on the Beakon itself.\n\n- Number of uses left indicated by the number of circles on the Squid Beakon icon on the map or the number of lights on the Beakon itself.\n\n- Number of uses left indicated by the number of circles on the Squid Beakon icon on the map or the number of lights on the Beakon itself.\n\n- ▲ Increased the effect of the Ink Saver (Sub) gear ability.\n\n- ▲ The benefits of the Sub Power Up gear ability are now more likely to occur, even with fewer instances of the gear ability equipped.\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- Super Jumping to a Squid Beakon in Moray Towers.\n\n- Map icon; the dots denoting the number of uses added in version 4.2.0 can be seen.\n\nSquid Beakon returns in Splatoon 3 and remains identical to its iteration in Splatoon 2. In Splatoon 3, the Big Bubbler special also acts as a Squid Beakon when active.\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- 3D Tableturf Battle artwork\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- The Squid Beakon resembles an airport surveillance radar mounted on a camera tripod.\n\n- Squid Beakon has the highest ink consumption of all sub weapons. In Splatoon, it is not possible to place two Squid Beakons without the need to refill ink, even when equipped with as much Ink Saver (Sub) as possible.\n\n- At the launch of Splatoon, the only weapon that had Squid Beakon as part of its kit was the Krak-On Splat Roller, making it the least common sub weapon upon release.\nLikewise, at the launch of Splatoon 2, the only weapons that had Squid Beakon as part of their kits were the Krak-On Splat Roller and Dapple Dualies.\nThe same scenario also happened at the launch of Splatoon 3, as the only weapons that had Squid Beakons as part of their kits were the Dapple Dualies and Tenta Brella.\n\n- Likewise, at the launch of Splatoon 2, the only weapons that had Squid Beakon as part of their kits were the Krak-On Splat Roller and Dapple Dualies.\n\n- The same scenario also happened at the launch of Splatoon 3, as the only weapons that had Squid Beakons as part of their kits were the Dapple Dualies and Tenta Brella.\n\n- In Splatoon, only two specials appear on weapons with Squid Beakon as their sub weapon, being the Kraken and Killer Wail.\n\n- When standing next to a Squid Beakon, Inkling voice clips can be heard. This is often difficult to notice, due to the fact that multiplayer music may drown out these sounds.\nThese voice clips are distorted versions of the Inkling voice clips that come from players.\n\n- These voice clips are distorted versions of the Inkling voice clips that come from players.\n\n- Likewise, at the launch of Splatoon 2, the only weapons that had Squid Beakon as part of their kits were the Krak-On Splat Roller and Dapple Dualies.\n\n- The same scenario also happened at the launch of Splatoon 3, as the only weapons that had Squid Beakons as part of their kits were the Dapple Dualies and Tenta Brella.\n\n- These voice clips are distorted versions of the Inkling voice clips that come from players.\n\nSquid Beakon is a play on the words beacon and squid beak."
