    "Ink Mine is a sub weapon in the Splatoon series. They are hidden in ink and explode if an opponent gets too close or the mine gets inked over, damaging and tracking any opponents hit.",
    "The Ink Mine is invisible to opponents once placed. To the user and the user's teammates, the Ink Mine appears to be a collection of round black dots arranged in a circular pattern as well as some dots bearing the team's ink color floating in the air around it. When the Ink Mine is activated, the area around it glows brightly before the mine explodes.",
    "The Ink Mine is an explosive that can be placed on the floor directly under the Inkling who placed it. They cannot be placed on uninkable surfaces nor on grates. Placed mines are practically invisible to enemies unless they have the Bomb Sniffer ability. If any members of the opposing team walk on or stand near the Ink Mine, it explodes in a burst of ink. After a period of time, if no enemies have come near the Ink Mine, it explodes. It also explodes if it is covered in the enemy's ink.",
    "Ink Mines last ten seconds before detonating on their own and detonate in one second if triggered. Each Ink Mine uses 50% of the ink tank's capacity. It deals 180 damage to opponents caught directly in the blast and 30 damage to those near the blast.",

    "Up to two Ink Mines can now be active and placed at any time, though they deal much less damage and use 60% of the ink tank's capacity. Players can now keep track of Ink Mines that they have placed via a slightly transparent Ink Mine icon that wraps around the screen. When an Ink Mine detonates, the icon becomes opaque and is crossed out. The detection radius of Ink Mines is also now visible to both the user and their teammates. Any additional Ink Mines cannot be placed within this radius.",
    "Ink Mines explode when an opponent gets too close or when enemy ink covers it. When a third Ink Mine is placed and there are two undetonated mines, the Ink Mine placed earliest will explode. Once triggered, Ink Mines detonate in 0.75 seconds. Opponents caught directly in the blast are dealt 45 damage while those on the edge of the blast are dealt 35 damage. Anyone within range of the blast, even if they are behind walls or are not dealt damage to, is temporarily marked for a base duration of 5 seconds.",
