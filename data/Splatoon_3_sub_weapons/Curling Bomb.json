It bears a strong resemblance to a curling stone. There are green lights on the top that turn red when the Curling Bomb is about to explode. The Curling Bombs used by Agent 4 in Octo Canyon have a darker handle and blue, oval-shaped lights instead of rectangular green ones.\n\nWhen deployed, the Curling Bomb travels straight across the floor, leaving a trail of ink and bouncing off any wall or obstacle it encounters. It explodes after it has traveled its maximum distance. The maximum distance of the Curling Bomb may be shortened by charging, or 'cooking' it with  before release - unless it is coming from a Curling-Bomb Launcher, in which case, this increases its travel distance. 'Cooking' the Curling Bomb also causes it to grow larger, increasing the amount of turf it inks as it travels and the size of its blast radius.\n\nWhile traveling, the Curling Bomb deals 20 damage to enemies it comes into contact with. Upon detonation, it deals 180 damage to enemies in the main blast radius and 30 damage to enemies in the outer blast radius.\n\nThe Curling Bomb is comparable to the Seeker from Splatoon, though it excels in path-making as it cannot be 'distracted' by enemy Inklings and Octolings. The wall-bouncing and cooking capabilities of the Curling Bomb also hold versatility over the Seeker.\n\nIt appears in two Octo Expansion Stations:\n\n- B06 Notorious Station\n\n- J03D08 Girl Power Station\n\n- The circle on the top of the Curling Bomb displays the amount of time left before it detonates.\n\n- As it approaches its maximum distance, the Curling Bomb makes the same sound effect as a primed  Splat Bomb.\n\n- The Curling Bomb slows down as it approaches its maximum distance.\n\n- LEDs surrounding the handle of the Curling Bomb light up as the bomb is 'cooked'.\n\n- If the player remains idle after deploying the Curling Bomb, the player remains in a weaponless stance and performs a fist pump and nods upon the bomb exploding.\n\n- If the player is low on ink and tries to release a Curling Bomb, they look down at their hand to see nothing, instead of looking back like other sub weapons.\n\n- — Fixed an issue causing Curling Bombs to lose speed inappropriately when thrown on sloping surfaces.\n\n- — Slightly increased the volume of the pre-detonation effects.\n\n- ▼ Extended the interval between use and when ink begins refilling by 15/60 of a second.\n\n- ▼ Reduced the radius at which the blast can deal 30.0 damage to an opponent by roughly 13%.\n\n- ▼ Decreased radius of ink coverage and damage dealt by Curling Bomb explosion when  is pressed and immediately released.\n\n- ▲ Bomb now grows in size the longer  is held, increasing ink coverage while traveling and area of ink coverage and damage dealt when it explodes.\n\n- ▲ Decreased amount of time before ink recovery begins after use in proportion to how long  is held.\n\n- ▲ Reduced the time to begin recovering ink after shooting by roughly 5/60 to 15/60 of a second depending on how long  is held.\nIf  is released immediately, time is reduced by 5/60 of a second.\nIf  is held for the full duration, time is reduced by 15/60 of a second.\n\n- If  is released immediately, time is reduced by 5/60 of a second.\n\n- If  is held for the full duration, time is reduced by 15/60 of a second.\n\n- If  is released immediately, time is reduced by 5/60 of a second.\n\n- If  is held for the full duration, time is reduced by 15/60 of a second.\n\n- ▲ Increased the explosion's maximum damage from 150.0 to 180.0.\n\n- Promotional render of Curling Bomb.\n\n- 3D art\n\n- An Inkling throwing a Curling Bomb\n\n- Curling Bomb when holding\n\n- Curling Bomb in Octo Canyon.\n\n- The Curling Bomb mem cake.\n\nCurling Bombs return in Splatoon 3, functioning the same as they did in the previous game.\n\nCurling Bomb appears several times in the Return of the Mammalians and are available as an upgrade for the Hero Suit. The missions that they appear as not part of the Hero Suit are:\n\n- 0109 The String's The Thing\n\n- 0302 They Said We'd Have Flying Cars, and We Do! Kinda!\n\n- 0304 Try Curling! Alterna's 11th Most Popular Athleisure Activity!\n\n- 0411 Stamp 'Em Out\n\n- 0605 The Enemy Ink Is Lava!\n\nCurling Bombs appear in Side Order as the base sub weapon of Pearl's and Murch's Palette. They also appear as a purchasable sub weapon on Vending-Machine Corner Floors, costing 500 Membux by default.\n\n- The facial expressions of the player when remaining idle as the Curling Bomb explodes has changed to be more expressive, now having the player smile with closed eyes.\n\n- — Reduced the radius at which the blast can deal maximum damage to an opponent by 20% to 8% depending on how long  is held: 2-5 units → 1.6-4.6 units.[1]\nAlthough the blast radius was reduced, the way the game handles hit detection for the inner blast radius was changed, thus the effective blast radius remains about the same.\n\n- Although the blast radius was reduced, the way the game handles hit detection for the inner blast radius was changed, thus the effective blast radius remains about the same.\n\n- Although the blast radius was reduced, the way the game handles hit detection for the inner blast radius was changed, thus the effective blast radius remains about the same.\n\n- A Curling Bomb seen in Museum d'Alfonsino from the Return of the Mammalians trailer\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- 3D Tableturf Battle artwork of a Curling Bomb.\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- Curling Bomb upgrade icon when upgrading the Hero Gear in Return of the Mammalians.\n\n- 2D icon used in Side Order\n\nFor competitive tips about the Curling Bomb\n\n- On most stages, Curling Bombs can be thrown over certain walls and barriers by standing very close and then throwing them over at maximum jump height.\n\n- In Splatoon 3, there is a unique splat message for when the player gets splatted by the bomb's contact damage, showing \"Hit by Curling Bomb!\".\n\n- The Curling Bomb is the only Sub weapon not to have an associated weapon brand."
