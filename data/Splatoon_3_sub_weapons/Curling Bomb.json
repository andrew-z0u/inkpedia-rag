    "The Curling Bomb is a sub weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3. It is a bomb that slides forward, leaving behind an ink trail, until it explodes.",
    "The Curling Bomb is a short black cylinder with a gray handle on top and panels on the side that change color to match the user's ink. It bears a strong resemblance to a curling stone. There are green lights on the top that turn red when the Curling Bomb is about to explode. The Curling Bombs used by Agent 4 in Octo Canyon have a darker handle and blue, oval-shaped lights instead of rectangular green ones.",
    "When deployed, the Curling Bomb travels straight across the floor, leaving a trail of ink and bouncing off any wall or obstacle it encounters. It explodes after it has traveled its maximum distance. The maximum distance of the Curling Bomb may be shortened by charging, or 'cooking' it with  before release - unless it is coming from a Curling-Bomb Launcher, in which case, this increases its travel distance. 'Cooking' the Curling Bomb also causes it to grow larger, increasing the amount of turf it inks as it travels and the size of its blast radius.",
    "While traveling, the Curling Bomb deals 20 damage to enemies it comes into contact with. Upon detonation, it deals 180 damage to enemies in the main blast radius and 30 damage to enemies in the outer blast radius.",
    "The Curling Bomb is comparable to the Seeker from Splatoon, though it excels in path-making as it cannot be 'distracted' by enemy Inklings and Octolings. The wall-bouncing and cooking capabilities of the Curling Bomb also hold versatility over the Seeker.",

    "- LEDs surrounding the handle of the Curling Bomb light up as the bomb is 'cooked'.",
    "- If the player remains idle after deploying the Curling Bomb, the player remains in a weaponless stance and performs a fist pump and nods upon the bomb exploding.",
    "- If the player is low on ink and tries to release a Curling Bomb, they look down at their hand to see nothing, instead of looking back like other sub weapons.",
