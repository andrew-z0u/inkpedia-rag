    "The Burst Bomb is a sub weapon in the Splatoon series. It is a weak bomb with a low ink cost that explodes on impact.",
    "Burst Bombs are spherical balloons that change color to match the user's ink. They have white horizontal stripes going across them and a knot on top that leaves the end sticking up. The Burst Bombs used by Agent 3 in Octo Valley are a much darker version of Agent 3's ink color with a rim highlight matching the ink color. They have horizontal lights around them as opposed to white lines, and are tied with a clip rather than a knot. The lights change color depending on the upgrade level.",
