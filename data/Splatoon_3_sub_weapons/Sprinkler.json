    "The Sprinkler is a sub weapon in the Splatoon series. It is thrown and attaches to any surface, and sprays ink in a circular ring around itself in a staggering motion indefinitely until it is destroyed by an opponent.",
    "The Sprinkler has two main parts; a base and a head. The base is flat and cone-shaped with a black bottom. It changes color to match the user's ink and has its manufacturer's logo on it. The head is a short, wide pole with two flat and rectangular nozzles sticking out of it. The pole and nozzles are black and the nozzles have attachments that change color to match the user's ink. Once deployed, the Sprinkler's appearance is unchanged other than it spinning around and shooting ink.",

    "- One should avoid getting too close to enemy Sprinklers - while their damage is low, multiple hits can be dangerous.",
    "- A Sprinkler may be bait, especially if stuck to a high wall or ceiling. It would be wise to keep an eye on one's surroundings when destroying it.",
