There is a small circular base at the bottom of the pole and a bar sticking out of each side at the top of the pole. In Splatoon, the Splash Wall's main body is red and dark green with a red base and lime green bars. The bars have dark green supports and red tubes. In Splatoon 2, the main body is black with a black base and dark blue bars with black supports. In both games, after the Splash Wall is deployed, ink begins to come out of the bars and the ink tank in the middle begins to drain. The ink in the ink tank and coming out of the bars changes color to match the user's ink.\n\nThe Splash Wall forms a temporary barrier of falling ink, preventing enemy fire from passing through. Opponents will instantly get splatted if they attempt to walk through the Splash Wall, but the player who spawned it and their teammates will take no damage. These players will also be able to shoot through the wall. The opposing team can shoot the Splash Wall down rather than waiting for it to disappear. If a player tries to throw a splash wall while another splash wall is deployed, the \"can't use\" message will happen. A similar weapon is also used by the Octarians in Octo Valley.\n\n- The Splash Wall will cause Splat Bombs or Suction Bombs to explode immediately, which can be disastrous if the thrower is too close to the Splash Wall.\n\n- A tactic for the Splash Wall in Splatoon is to place it down right in front of the Tower in Tower Control. The Tower goes through the wall but the wall will force the enemies to get off the Tower, allowing the other team to claim it.\n\n- When the Splash Wall is shot by enemy ink, the time remaining until it despawns begins depleting faster. Remaining time can be viewed in an ink-filled tube in the middle of the weapon.\n\n- Splash Walls cannot do any damage to the Rainmaker shield. The barrier will instantly destroy the Splash Wall on contact.\n\nAfter deploying a Splash Wall, there is a 2.67-second delay before ink can be refilled again. This refill penalty and the 60% ink consumed by the wall make it necessary to use ink management abilities. To keep up the pressure on opponents by firing for longer periods, a combination of the Ink Saver (Main) and Ink Saver (Sub) abilities is needed. The charts below show that while Ink Saver (Main) has a greater impact, it is still optimal to use both abilities. The ink refill penalty makes Ink Recovery Up less useful, so Ink Saver abilities should be prioritized over Ink Recovery Up.\n\n- .52 Gal\n\n- .96 Gal Deco\n\n- Bamboozler 14 Mk I\n\n- Cherry H-3 Nozzlenose\n\n- Heavy Splatling\n\n- Jet Squelcher\n\n- Range Blaster\n\n- Slosher Deco\n\n- Bento Splat Charger, Bento Splatterscope\n\n- CoroCoro Splat Roller\n\n- — Correct the amount of damage done by bombs when they are thrown against the Splash Wall.\n\n- ▲ Fixed the issue in which users can sometimes inflict damage on their opponents by throwing a bomb while standing up against the opponent's Splash Wall.\n\n- ▼ Lowered the resistance against opponent attacks by about 40%.\n\n- ▼ Increased the amount of time required to begin recharging the ink after throwing this weapon: 1.33 seconds → 2.67 seconds\n\n- ▼ Even if the Splash Wall is used on a slope, so that it hits the ground immediately, it will still take as long to activate as when it is used on flat ground.\n\n- High quality art of a Splash Wall.\n\n- A Splash Wall being thrown.\n\n- A deployed Splash Wall.\n\n- An Inkling approaching a Splash Wall.\n\n- The Splash Wall in action in Walleye Warehouse.\n\n- A Splash Wall deployed in Museum d'Alfonsino.\n\n- A screenshot from before Splatoon's release, showing the original name of the Splash Wall.\n\n- Concept art of various sub weapons, with the Splash Wall at the lower right.\n\n- An Early Splash Wall.\n\nThe Splash Wall returns in Splatoon 2. It functions mostly the same to how it did in the first game, with some changes. It no longer instantly splats enemy players that touch it, instead bumping them away while dealing slight damage. It can still splat but only if the damage dealt is enough to do so. Additionally, it can be thrown while a wall is already active, destroying the previously placed wall in the process.\n\nIn the Octo Canyon levels Octoling Strike, Octolings Ahoy!, and Octoling Workout, Splash Walls appear as a stationary obstacle. In these levels, the Splash Walls activate only when Agent 4 approaches them, and unlike the sub-weapon version, these Splash Walls do not dissipate over time and must be destroyed with ink.\n\nIn the Octo Expansion, Splash Walls appear as stationary obstacles at multiple stations. In Far-Out Station and Rad Ride Station, these Splash Walls behave like the ones in Octo Canyon, deploying when Agent 8 approaches them. In Toastmaster Station, Splash Walls are automatically deployed in the third phase of the Octo Oven XXL battle, protecting the boss's tentacle on all sides. In Hasta La Vista Station, a Splash Wall automatically deploys in front of the Octocommander in the third wave of enemies.\n\n- ▼ Damage: 50 → 30\n\n- ▼ Decrease rate at which damage is dealt from 1/60 of a second to 1/2 of a second.\n\n- ▲ Decreased time until deployment after throwing out the Splash Wall by 0.5 seconds.\n\n- — Fixed an issue occasionally allowing opposing players standing behind a Splash Wall to be splatted when a bomb hit the edge of the wall.\n\n- ▲ Decreased time after using before ink recovery begins by roughly 1 second.\n\n- ▲ Now possible to create a wall when a wall the player created already exists in the stage. Creating a new wall will cause the older one to disappear.\n\n- ▲ Decreased least amount of time for wall to open after being placed by roughly 15/60 of a second.\nThis change decreases the time until the wall opens when creating a wall on either flat ground or facing a downward slope by roughly 15/60 of a second.\nWhen creating a wall while facing an upward slope or other condition that causes the wall to be placed immediately, there will be no change in how quickly the wall opens.\n\n- This change decreases the time until the wall opens when creating a wall on either flat ground or facing a downward slope by roughly 15/60 of a second.\n\n- When creating a wall while facing an upward slope or other condition that causes the wall to be placed immediately, there will be no change in how quickly the wall opens.\n\n- This change decreases the time until the wall opens when creating a wall on either flat ground or facing a downward slope by roughly 15/60 of a second.\n\n- When creating a wall while facing an upward slope or other condition that causes the wall to be placed immediately, there will be no change in how quickly the wall opens.\n\n- ▲ Decreased the time between using the Splash Wall and when ink recovery begins by roughly 15/60 of a second.\n\n- ▲ After installation, time taken to deploy shield decreased by 5/60 of a second.\n\nEnemy attacks will make it break down more quickly.\n\nYou can only place one at a time.\n\n- A promo image of the Splash Wall.\n\n- A Splash Wall deployed on Humpback Pump Track.\n\n- A Splash wall deployed on Camp Triggerfish.\n\nThe Splash Wall returns in Splatoon 3, looking identical and functioning near-identically as in Splatoon 2. Notably, the Splash Wall destroys opposing deployable specials (such as the Tacticooler) thrown into it and delays the slide of opposing Reefsliders, though it does not stop them completely.\n\nSplash Wall appears in Side Order as the base sub weapon of DJ Octavio's Palette. They also appear as a purchasable sub weapon on Vending-Machine Corner Floors, costing 500 Membux by default.\n\n- — Fixed an issue where a Splash Wall would immediately disappear if placed in a certain location.\n\n- ▼ Damage dealt to Splash Wall increased by about 10% for the following weapons:\n\n- Sploosh-o-matic\n\n- Neo Sploosh-o-matic\n\n- Splattershot Jr.\n\n- Custom Splattershot Jr.\n\n- Aerospray MG\n\n- Aerospray RG\n\n- Luna Blaster\n\n- Luna Blaster Neo\n\n- Order Blaster Replica\n\n- Clash Blaster\n\n- Clash Blaster Neo\n\n- Carbon Roller\n\n- Carbon Roller Deco\n\n- Splat Roller\n\n- Krak-On Splat Roller\n\n- Order Roller Replica\n\n- Inkbrush\n\n- Inkbrush Nouveau\n\n- Octobrush\n\n- Octobrush Nouveau\n\n- Orderbrush Replica\n\n- Dapple Dualies\n\n- Dapple Dualies Nouveau\n\n- Promotional screenshot\n\n- 3D Tableturf Battle artwork\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- 2D icon used in Side Order\n\nFor competitive tips about the Splash Wall\n\n- The Splash Wall has 800 HP upon setup.\n\n- The Splash Wall was originally called \"Ink Shield\", as seen in an image from before Splatoon's release.\n\n- The Splash Wall has the most damage per second of any weapon in the game, at 50 per tick.\n\n- Splash Walls are used in many out of bounds glitches. If an opponent places a Splash Wall next to a wall, then the player stands between the wall and the Splash Wall and activates a Baller, the player will clip into the wall."
