    "The Splash Wall is a sub weapon in the Splatoon series. It is a temporary barrier that blocks enemies from shooting or passing through it while not affecting the thrower or their team.",
    "The Splash Wall's main body is a tall, thin pole with an ink tank in the middle. There is a small circular base at the bottom of the pole and a bar sticking out of each side at the top of the pole. In Splatoon, the Splash Wall's main body is red and dark green with a red base and lime green bars. The bars have dark green supports and red tubes. In Splatoon 2, the main body is black with a black base and dark blue bars with black supports. In both games, after the Splash Wall is deployed, ink begins to come out of the bars and the ink tank in the middle begins to drain. The ink in the ink tank and coming out of the bars changes color to match the user's ink.",
    "The Splash Wall forms a temporary barrier of falling ink, preventing enemy fire from passing through. Opponents will instantly get splatted if they attempt to walk through the Splash Wall, but the player who spawned it and their teammates will take no damage. These players will also be able to shoot through the wall. The opposing team can shoot the Splash Wall down rather than waiting for it to disappear. If a player tries to throw a splash wall while another splash wall is deployed, the \"can't use\" message will happen. A similar weapon is also used by the Octarians in Octo Valley.",
    "- The Splash Wall will cause Splat Bombs or Suction Bombs to explode immediately, which can be disastrous if the thrower is too close to the Splash Wall.",
    "- A tactic for the Splash Wall in Splatoon is to place it down right in front of the Tower in Tower Control. The Tower goes through the wall but the wall will force the enemies to get off the Tower, allowing the other team to claim it.",
    "- When the Splash Wall is shot by enemy ink, the time remaining until it despawns begins depleting faster. Remaining time can be viewed in an ink-filled tube in the middle of the weapon.",
    "- Splash Walls cannot do any damage to the Rainmaker shield. The barrier will instantly destroy the Splash Wall on contact.",
    "After deploying a Splash Wall, there is a 2.67-second delay before ink can be refilled again. This refill penalty and the 60% ink consumed by the wall make it necessary to use ink management abilities. To keep up the pressure on opponents by firing for longer periods, a combination of the Ink Saver (Main) and Ink Saver (Sub) abilities is needed. The charts below show that while Ink Saver (Main) has a greater impact, it is still optimal to use both abilities. The ink refill penalty makes Ink Recovery Up less useful, so Ink Saver abilities should be prioritized over Ink Recovery Up.",

    "The Splash Wall returns in Splatoon 2. It functions mostly the same to how it did in the first game, with some changes. It no longer instantly splats enemy players that touch it, instead bumping them away while dealing slight damage. It can still splat but only if the damage dealt is enough to do so. Additionally, it can be thrown while a wall is already active, destroying the previously placed wall in the process.",
    "In the Octo Canyon levels Octoling Strike, Octolings Ahoy!, and Octoling Workout, Splash Walls appear as a stationary obstacle. In these levels, the Splash Walls activate only when Agent 4 approaches them, and unlike the sub-weapon version, these Splash Walls do not dissipate over time and must be destroyed with ink.",
    "In the Octo Expansion, Splash Walls appear as stationary obstacles at multiple stations. In Far-Out Station and Rad Ride Station, these Splash Walls behave like the ones in Octo Canyon, deploying when Agent 8 approaches them. In Toastmaster Station, Splash Walls are automatically deployed in the third phase of the Octo Oven XXL battle, protecting the boss's tentacle on all sides. In Hasta La Vista Station, a Splash Wall automatically deploys in front of the Octocommander in the third wave of enemies.",

    "The Splash Wall returns in Splatoon 3, looking identical and functioning near-identically as in Splatoon 2. Notably, the Splash Wall destroys opposing deployable specials (such as the Tacticooler) thrown into it and delays the slide of opposing Reefsliders, though it does not stop them completely.",
    "Splash Wall appears in Side Order as the base sub weapon of DJ Octavio's Palette. They also appear as a purchasable sub weapon on Vending-Machine Corner Floors, costing 500 Membux by default.",

    "- Splash Walls are used in many out of bounds glitches. If an opponent places a Splash Wall next to a wall, then the player stands between the wall and the Splash Wall and activates a Baller, the player will clip into the wall."
