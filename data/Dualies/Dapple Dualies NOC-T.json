However, small black flashlights with yellow lenses have been put on the front of each dualie. Each Flashlight has a small Barazushi sticker on the side. In regards to color palette, the Dapple Dualies NOC-T have a brown and grey base with some white details along the top half. The back part (which is a toothbrush) is mostly orange with several grey accents and small yellow details. A thin white string connects the tip of the toothbrush to a section of the main dualie.\n\nThe Dapple Dualies NOC-T makes its first appearance in Splatoon 3 as part of the Splatlands Collection. Its kit is Splat Bomb and Killer Wail 5.1.\n\n- The Dapple Dualies NOC-T is a lightweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 9.5. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The ink consumption is 0.663% per shot, allowing the user to fire for about 12.5 seconds on a full ink tank.\n\n- When firing continuously, it shoots a bullet every 5 frames (12 shots per second).\n\n- When firing from humanoid form, the first shot takes 3 frames to come out. When firing from swim form, the first shot takes 12 frames to come out.\n\n- The interval between firing the weapon and being able to enter swim form or use a sub weapon is 4 frames.\n\n- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.084 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 20 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Each shot has a base damage of 36 and minimum damage of 18.\n\n- If a shot is in the air for more than 7 frames after being fired, it will lose about 2.25 damage every frame until it reaches 18 damage at frame 15.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with players has a radius of 0.25 units.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with the environment has a radius of 0.2 units.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while on the ground is 6.8 degrees.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while in the air is 11.66 degrees.\n\n- The outer reticle immediately expands after jumping. After 25 frames, the outer reticle will start shrinking, and will finish shrinking after 70 frames.\n\n- The weapon starts off having a 5% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle.\nThis chance increases by 3% per shot, and maximizes at a 40% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 12 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- This chance increases by 3% per shot, and maximizes at a 40% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 12 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- When jumping, the chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle is immediately set to 40%.\n\n- Accuracy starts recovering 5 frames after the player stops shooting. The chance to shoot towards the outer reticle decreases by 0.5% per frame, if the chance is not already at the minimum, meaning that it takes 75 frames to reach maximum accuracy.\n\n- Shots initially travel straight at a rate of 1.8334 units per frame for 3 frames. Shots travel straight for 5.5002 distance units.\nAfter that, the shot's velocity is set to 1.81641 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 1.81641 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- The effective range is about 8.44 units.\nThis number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n- This number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n- This chance increases by 3% per shot, and maximizes at a 40% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 12 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 1.81641 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- This number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n- Each roll consumes 5% of the ink tank capacity.\n\n- The user can roll 2 times without interruption. After this, there is a delay before the player can roll again.\n\n- Rolls cover an initial distance of 3.0 units during the rolling animation, plus an additional 0.6 units of sliding afterwards.\n\n- After performing a roll, it shoots a bullet every 4 frames.\nThe ink consumption per shot remains the same, so the player can fire for about 9.53 seconds after rolling once if they have a full ink tank before rolling.\n\n- The ink consumption per shot remains the same, so the player can fire for about 9.53 seconds after rolling once if they have a full ink tank before rolling.\n\n- After rolling, there is a 50 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Damage per shot does not change after rolling.\n\n- After rolling, shots have a radius of 0.25 units.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate in the post-roll state is 3.89 degrees.\n\n- After performing a roll, the two individual reticles will merge into a single reticle. The rate of shot deviation remains the same.\n\n- The Dapple Dualies NOC-T cannot shoot while rolling. Shots will only fire once the rolling animation is completed.\n\n- The rolling state can be broken down as follows:\nAfter a 4 frame startup, the roll animation lasts for 8 frames, after which the player can input another roll if they have not yet exhausted all available rolls.\nAfter the roll completes, it takes 4 frames before the weapon can be fired. After an additional 24 frames, the user will regain their rolls and reenter a normal state if they move or stop firing.\nIn total, this takes 40 frames.\n\n- After a 4 frame startup, the roll animation lasts for 8 frames, after which the player can input another roll if they have not yet exhausted all available rolls.\n\n- After the roll completes, it takes 4 frames before the weapon can be fired. After an additional 24 frames, the user will regain their rolls and reenter a normal state if they move or stop firing.\n\n- In total, this takes 40 frames.\n\n- The shot velocity and shot travel distance remains the same in the post-roll state.\n\n- Rolling creates a pool of ink with a radius of 1.8 units.\n\n- The ink consumption per shot remains the same, so the player can fire for about 9.53 seconds after rolling once if they have a full ink tank before rolling.\n\n- After a 4 frame startup, the roll animation lasts for 8 frames, after which the player can input another roll if they have not yet exhausted all available rolls.\n\n- After the roll completes, it takes 4 frames before the weapon can be fired. After an additional 24 frames, the user will regain their rolls and reenter a normal state if they move or stop firing.\n\n- In total, this takes 40 frames.\n\n[1][2]\n\nIt's a shame that Dapple Dualies users move so fastâ€“the other team will barely get an eyeball on the updated design of the Dapple Dualies NOC-T from Barazushi!  Especially because said player will be peppering the other team with Splat Bombs and Dodge Rolling to get in position to set up the Killer Wail 5.1 for those pesky distant foes. I'd recommend this set for anyone who can see the big picture and wants the ability to manage micro-battles both near and far.\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- Promotional image of the Splatlands Collection - Barazushi weapons\n\n- Promotional image of the Barazushi collection\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Dapple_Dualies_NOC-T_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nPromotional video (link to file)\n\nThe suffix \"NOC-T\" is a stylized spelling of the word nocturnal, an organism that is mostly active during night, thematically matching the night vision scopes attached to the weapon."
