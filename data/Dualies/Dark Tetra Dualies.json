  "content": "The Dark Tetra Dualies are a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3. They are a mid-ranged dualie-type weapon with a few unique properties.\n\nEach pistol has two muzzles and four dodge roll nozzles, which uniquely allows the user to perform up to four dodge rolls in a row. The dodge rolls are somewhat slower than the regular Splat Dualies' and it takes longer to start rolling and moving normally again. This weapon also allows the user to continue shooting while rolling, a property no other dualie has.\n\nPlayers must land four hits to splat an opponent, doing the same damage as the Dualie Squelchers but having worse accuracy pre-roll. Dodge roll ink consumption is lower than all other dualies', complementing the weapon's ability to roll four times in quick succession. In the post-roll state, the weapon's fire rate and accuracy are improved.\n\nThey were revealed on 11 February 2018 at 14:00 UTC[1] and released for Splatoon 2 on 2 March 2018 at 02:00 UTC.[2] For Splatoon 3, they were released at launch on 9 September 2022.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Splatoon 2\n\n2.1 Data\n\n2.1.1 Rolling\n\n\n2.2 Details\n2.3 Version history\n2.4 Quotes\n2.5 Gallery\n2.6 Demonstration\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n2.1.1 Rolling\n\n- 2.1.1 Rolling\n\n- 2.2 Details\n\n- 2.3 Version history\n\n- 2.4 Quotes\n\n- 2.5 Gallery\n\n- 2.6 Demonstration\n\n- 3 Splatoon 3\n\n3.1 Data\n\n3.1.1 Rolling\n\n\n3.2 Quotes\n3.3 Weapon freshness rewards\n3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n3.1.1 Rolling\n\n- 3.1.1 Rolling\n\n- 3.2 Quotes\n\n- 3.3 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 4 Strategy\n\n- 5 Trivia\n\n- 6 Etymology\n\n6.1 Names in other languages\n6.2 Translation notes\n\n- 6.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 6.2 Translation notes\n\n- 7 References\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n2.1.1 Rolling\n\n- 2.1.1 Rolling\n\n- 2.2 Details\n\n- 2.3 Version history\n\n- 2.4 Quotes\n\n- 2.5 Gallery\n\n- 2.6 Demonstration\n\n- 2.1.1 Rolling\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n3.1.1 Rolling\n\n- 3.1.1 Rolling\n\n- 3.2 Quotes\n\n- 3.3 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.1.1 Rolling\n\n- 6.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 6.2 Translation notes\n\nThe Dark Tetra Dualies are a set of dualies that seem to be created from plastic derringer pistols with two muzzles, each attached to the sole and pull tab of a basketball shoe. Each consists of two main parts, each in a crescent shape. The main sole-like part of each dualie serves as a front plate, housing two muzzles and four compartments - one for each dodge roll. It has green and purple highlights. The main black part is smaller than the white part and serves as a handle. It has white highlights.\n\nThe Dark Tetra Dualies come in a set with Autobombs and Splashdown.\n\nThey appear in one Octo Expansion station:\n\n- F09 Bring It Station\n\n- The Dark Tetra Dualies is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 140. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The ink consumption of 0.8% and ink tank capacity of 100% allows players to fire 125 shots before needing to refill the ink supply.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- When initially firing the weapon in humanoid form, the first shot takes 3 frames to come out.\n\n- When firing from swim form, the first shot takes 12 frames to come out.\n\n- The interval between firing and when the player is able to enter swim form or use a sub weapon is 4 frames.\n\n- When firing continuously, it shoots a bullet every 6 frames (10 shots per second).\n\n- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.72 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 20 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Each shot has a base damage of 28.\n\n- If a shot is in the air for more than 8 frames after being fired, it loses 1.75 damage per frame until it reaches 14 damage at frame 16.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with players has a radius of 2 units.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with the environment has a radius of 2 units.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while on the ground is 7.4 degrees.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while in the air is 12.8 degrees.\n\n- The outer reticle immediately expands after jumping.

Yes, I said FOUR! And because you can shoot while rolling, you'll be able to zip around stages with ease and roll your way to victory. This loadout also comes with Autobombs, which almost seems unfair. You can use those to chase your opponents out of hiding spots, and then swoop in with the splat. And if they slip away? Fire up the Reefslider and hunt 'em down, shark-style. I recommend this set for those who want to set up their own pincer moves and pressure the enemy!\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- Tableturf Battle card art\n\nFor competitive tips about the Dark Tetra Dualies\n\n- Although they have collaborated with Splat to create the Tentatek Splattershot, the Dark Tetra Dualies are the first weapons to be fully produced by Tentatek.\n\n- The weapon's sneaker-like design fits the Tentatek brand, which specializes in sports clothing.\n\n- The Dark Tetra Dualies are one of the few weapons for which it is not apparent by their name that they are the first kit released for that weapon. Some other weapons that share this distinction are the Classic Squiffer, Nautilus 47, Snipewriter 5H, and the Mint Decavitator.\n\n- The announcement and release of this weapon set was at the same time as Goby Arena, and both its promo images are shot in it. This ties into the basketball theme for the Dark Tetra Dualies as well.\n\n- The Tetra Dualies were one of the weapons that were available to use in the Splatoon 3 Splatfest World Premiere.\n\nThe ancient Greek word and modern-day numerical prefix tetra means \"four\". This refers to the weapon's ability to dodge roll 4 times in a row.\n\nThe Tetra is also a species of freshwater fish."
