    "The Dark Tetra Dualies are a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3. They are a mid-ranged dualie-type weapon with a few unique properties.",
    "Each pistol has two muzzles and four dodge roll nozzles, which uniquely allows the user to perform up to four dodge rolls in a row. The dodge rolls are somewhat slower than the regular Splat Dualies' and it takes longer to start rolling and moving normally again. This weapon also allows the user to continue shooting while rolling, a property no other dualie has.",
    "Players must land four hits to splat an opponent, doing the same damage as the Dualie Squelchers but having worse accuracy pre-roll. Dodge roll ink consumption is lower than all other dualies', complementing the weapon's ability to roll four times in quick succession. In the post-roll state, the weapon's fire rate and accuracy are improved.",
    "They were revealed on 11 February 2018 at 14:00 UTC[1] and released for Splatoon 2 on 2 March 2018 at 02:00 UTC.[2] For Splatoon 3, they were released at launch on 9 September 2022.",
    "The Dark Tetra Dualies are a set of dualies that seem to be created from plastic derringer pistols with two muzzles, each attached to the sole and pull tab of a basketball shoe. Each consists of two main parts, each in a crescent shape. The main sole-like part of each dualie serves as a front plate, housing two muzzles and four compartments - one for each dodge roll. It has green and purple highlights. The main black part is smaller than the white part and serves as a handle. It has white highlights.",
    "The Dark Tetra Dualies come in a set with Autobombs and Splashdown.",
    "They appear in one Octo Expansion station:",
    "- F09 Bring It Station",
    "[3]",
    "- The weapon suffers from inferior accuracy before dodge rolling.",
    "- While the weapon can shoot while dodge rolling, the accuracy increase received from dodge rolls will not take effect for these shots. Accuracy will only be increased while the player is locked in place.",
    "- Promotional image",
    "The Dark Tetra Dualies return in Splatoon 3, appearing identical to the previous game. Their kit has Autobombs and Reefslider.",
    "It appears in one mission in Return of the Mammalians:",
    "- 0402 Octohoppers Don't Have a Sense of Humor (and They Hate Puns)!",

    "For competitive tips about the Dark Tetra Dualies",
    "- Although they have collaborated with Splat to create the Tentatek Splattershot, the Dark Tetra Dualies are the first weapons to be fully produced by Tentatek.",
    "- The weapon's sneaker-like design fits the Tentatek brand, which specializes in sports clothing.",
    "- The Dark Tetra Dualies are one of the few weapons for which it is not apparent by their name that they are the first kit released for that weapon. Some other weapons that share this distinction are the Classic Squiffer, Nautilus 47, Snipewriter 5H, and the Mint Decavitator.",
    "- The announcement and release of this weapon set was at the same time as Goby Arena, and both its promo images are shot in it. This ties into the basketball theme for the Dark Tetra Dualies as well.",
    "- The Tetra Dualies were one of the weapons that were available to use in the Splatoon 3 Splatfest World Premiere.",
    "The ancient Greek word and modern-day numerical prefix tetra means \"four\". This refers to the weapon's ability to dodge roll 4 times in a row.",
    "The Tetra is also a species of freshwater fish."
