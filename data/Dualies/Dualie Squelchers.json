    "The Dualie Squelchers are a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3. They are a re-imagining of the Dual Squelcher from Splatoon; if the player performs a dodge roll, their character will connect their Dualie Squelchers, effectively converting them into the Dual Squelcher. The weapon's accuracy is improved in this post-roll state.",
    "Compared to the Splat Dualies, the Dualie Squelchers have a slightly faster roll and are not locked into place, but suffer from an overall reduced firing rate and no fire rate increase after rolling. They have the second most range of any dualie-type weapon in the game since the release of the Douser Dualies. Shots do enough damage to splat opponents with four hits.",
    "The Dualie Squelchers are nearly identical in appearance to the Dual Squelcher's top and bottom parts. However, the tube that connects the two halves of the Dual Squelcher is exclusive to the right Dualie Squelcher.",

    "- The way the player holds the Dualie Squelchers after performing a dodge roll makes them appear nearly identical to the Dual Squelcher. Only the upper barrel fires after rolling, similarly to the Dual Squelcher.\nConsequently, the Dualie Squelchers are the only weapons of the dualie class with an asymmetrical design.",
    "- The appearance of the weapon is highly reminiscent of power drills.",
    "- The Dualie Squelchers are unique in the fact that the player can move immediately after a dodge roll and jump after performing the first dodge roll.",
    "- When exiting the dodge-roll stance, the Dualie Squelchers make a click sound when they separate.",
