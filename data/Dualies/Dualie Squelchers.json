  "content": "The Dualie Squelchers are a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3. They are a re-imagining of the Dual Squelcher from Splatoon; if the player performs a dodge roll, their character will connect their Dualie Squelchers, effectively converting them into the Dual Squelcher. The weapon's accuracy is improved in this post-roll state.\n\nCompared to the Splat Dualies, the Dualie Squelchers have a slightly faster roll and are not locked into place, but suffer from an overall reduced firing rate and no fire rate increase after rolling. They have the second most range of any dualie-type weapon in the game since the release of the Douser Dualies. Shots do enough damage to splat opponents with four hits.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Splatoon 2\n\n2.1 Data\n\n2.1.1 Rolling\n\n\n2.2 Differences from the Dual Squelcher\n2.3 Version history\n2.4 Quotes\n2.5 Gallery\n2.6 Demonstration\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n2.1.1 Rolling\n\n- 2.1.1 Rolling\n\n- 2.2 Differences from the Dual Squelcher\n\n- 2.3 Version history\n\n- 2.4 Quotes\n\n- 2.5 Gallery\n\n- 2.6 Demonstration\n\n- 3 Splatoon 3\n\n3.1 Data\n\n3.1.1 Rolling\n\n\n3.2 Quotes\n3.3 Weapon freshness rewards\n3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n3.1.1 Rolling\n\n- 3.1.1 Rolling\n\n- 3.2 Quotes\n\n- 3.3 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 4 Strategy\n\n- 5 Trivia\n\n- 6 Names in other languages\n\n6.1 Translation notes\n\n- 6.1 Translation notes\n\n- 7 References\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n2.1.1 Rolling\n\n- 2.1.1 Rolling\n\n- 2.2 Differences from the Dual Squelcher\n\n- 2.3 Version history\n\n- 2.4 Quotes\n\n- 2.5 Gallery\n\n- 2.6 Demonstration\n\n- 2.1.1 Rolling\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n3.1.1 Rolling\n\n- 3.1.1 Rolling\n\n- 3.2 Quotes\n\n- 3.3 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.1.1 Rolling\n\n- 6.1 Translation notes\n\nThe Dualie Squelchers are nearly identical in appearance to the Dual Squelcher's top and bottom parts. However, the tube that connects the two halves of the Dual Squelcher is exclusive to the right Dualie Squelcher.\n\nThe Dualie Squelchers come with Point Sensor and Tenta Missiles.

They feature an exceptional combination of highly accurate rapid fire after rolling, with longish range! You can pinpoint your opponents' positions with the Point Sensor and Tenta Missiles, making you a real nuisance to the enemy team! And you can dodge-roll away from opponents who get close! I recommend them for nimble fighters who want to support their team!\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- Roll with the Dualie Squelchers, making it look like the Dual Squelcher from Splatoon.\n\n- Official art of Dualie Squelchers, showing the Custom brand in the background.\n\n- An Inkling girl making an \"X\" sign with her Dualie Squelchers.\n\n- Used by the Inkling on the left.\n\n- Inkling boy with Dualie Squelchers.\n\n- Render\n\nThe Dualie Squelchers return in Splatoon 3 with Splat Bombs and Wave Breaker, which is based on the kit that the Dual Squelcher had in Splatoon.\n\nThey appear in one mission in Return of the Mammalians:\n\n- 0202 Absorbency and You\n\n- The Dualie Squelchers is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 17.

Would you like to have two of them? Good, because that's what Dualie Squelchers offer! If you don't know the Jet Squelcher, it features the ability to fire off extremely accurate and fairly rapid shots after executing a roll. And now you have TWO of them! Meanwhile, you can sniff out enemies with both the Wave Breaker special and your Splat Bombs. I call it the \"see it, splat it\" strategy.

Only the upper barrel fires after rolling, similarly to the Dual Squelcher.\nConsequently, the Dualie Squelchers are the only weapons of the dualie class with an asymmetrical design.\n\n- Consequently, the Dualie Squelchers are the only weapons of the dualie class with an asymmetrical design.\n\n- The appearance of the weapon is highly reminiscent of power drills.\n\n- The Dualie Squelchers are unique in the fact that the player can move immediately after a dodge roll and jump after performing the first dodge roll.\n\n- When exiting the dodge-roll stance, the Dualie Squelchers make a click sound when they separate.\n\n- In Splatoon 3, Sheldon notes the Dualie Squelchers' ability to \"stick and move\" in its description, likely referencing Stick 'n' Move Station, which features the weapon.\n\n- Consequently, the Dualie Squelchers are the only weapons of the dualie class with an asymmetrical design."
