When shooting normally, they splat opponents with three hits. After performing a dodge roll, it only takes two hits to splat an opponent and the shots will travel further. The Glooga Dualies are the only dualies to have increased range or increased damage in the post-roll state.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Splatoon 2\n\n2.1 Data\n\n2.1.1 Rolling\n\n\n2.2 Version history\n2.3 Quotes\n2.4 Gallery\n2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n2.1.1 Rolling\n\n- 2.1.1 Rolling\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3 Splatoon 3\n\n3.1 Data\n\n3.1.1 Rolling\n\n\n3.2 Version history\n3.3 Quotes\n3.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n3.5 Gallery\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n3.1.1 Rolling\n\n- 3.1.1 Rolling\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 3.5 Gallery\n\n- 4 Strategy\n\n- 5 Trivia\n\n- 6 Etymology\n\n6.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 6.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 7 References\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n2.1.1 Rolling\n\n- 2.1.1 Rolling\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 2.1.1 Rolling\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n3.1.1 Rolling\n\n- 3.1.1 Rolling\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 3.5 Gallery\n\n- 3.1.1 Rolling\n\n- 6.1 Names in other languages\n\nThe Glooga Dualies are blue hot glue guns with a red trigger and a metal rest in front of the nozzle. The dualies each have a main cylinder that houses the nozzle and a hot glue cartridge that changes color to match the user's ink. A pair of rectangular prisms house the trigger, and the back prism serves as a handle.\n\nThe Glooga Dualies were released on 2 December 2017 at 02:00 UTC.[1].

While its rate of fire isn't setting any records, the shots it fires immediately after a dodge roll can really melt the competition! And when you're not sticking it to your foes, the Ink Mine sub weapons can also help allies keep track of your foes. Finally, the Inkjet special makes supporting far-off teammates a snap.

After an additional 32 frames, the user will regain their rolls and reenter a normal state if they move or stop firing.\nIn total, this takes 60 frames.\n\n- After a 4 frame startup, the roll animation lasts for 16 frames, after which the player can input another roll if they have not yet exhausted all available rolls.\n\n- After the roll completes, it takes 8 frames before the weapon can be fired.

They're not the fastest dualies, but when you pull off a sweet Dodge Roll with these in your hands, you temporarily gain the ability to fire an outrageously powerful shot! Now, while the big-shot power grabs the headlines, many people overlook the Splash Wall sub. And that's a mistake, because it actually gives you great defensive balance. Last but not least, the Booyah Bomb special has the potential to tip the scales in your favor. I hope this balanced set helps you net a lopsided victory!\n\n- The Octoling farthest to the right has the Glooga Dualies.\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- Tableturf Battle card art\n\nFor competitive tips about the Glooga Dualies\n\n- The Glooga Dualies are the only main weapon not to appear as an initial weapon choice in the Octo Expansion as of its release. They only appear once as a canned main weapon during Ink from Above Station.\n\n- With enough Main Power Up (2 mains and 2 subs), the Glooga Dualies can splat opponents with one shot before rolling and one shot after.\n\n- When doing the Booyah Bomb trial in Judd's trials, the player has the Glooga Dualies.\n\n- The English name comes from the weapons' appearances, which are based on hot glue guns.\n\n- The Japanese name comes from the temperature scale, Kelvin, along with the weapons' damage value after a dodge roll, 52.5.\nWhile the temperature 525 kelvin (about 485°F / 252°C) itself is not notable, it might be a reference to the Draper point in physics, which is at 525° Celsius. The Draper point is the temperature at which almost all solids will visibly glow as a result of black-body radiation or incandescence.\nIt may also be a reference to high-temperature or dual-temperature glue guns, some models of which operate at temperatures of 252°C (525 K).\n\n- While the temperature 525 kelvin (about 485°F / 252°C) itself is not notable, it might be a reference to the Draper point in physics, which is at 525° Celsius.
