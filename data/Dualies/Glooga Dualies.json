    "The Glooga Dualies are a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3, manufactured by Deco.",
    "The Glooga Dualies are a dualie-type weapon whose power increases immediately following a dodge-roll. When shooting normally, they splat opponents with three hits. After performing a dodge roll, it only takes two hits to splat an opponent and the shots will travel further. The Glooga Dualies are the only dualies to have increased range or increased damage in the post-roll state.",
    "The Glooga Dualies are blue hot glue guns with a red trigger and a metal rest in front of the nozzle. The dualies each have a main cylinder that houses the nozzle and a hot glue cartridge that changes color to match the user's ink. A pair of rectangular prisms house the trigger, and the back prism serves as a handle.",
    "The Glooga Dualies were released on 2 December 2017 at 02:00 UTC.[1]. They come with Ink Mines and Inkjet.",

    "- The Glooga Dualies are the only main weapon not to appear as an initial weapon choice in the Octo Expansion as of its release. They only appear once as a canned main weapon during Ink from Above Station.",
    "- With enough Main Power Up (2 mains and 2 subs), the Glooga Dualies can splat opponents with one shot before rolling and one shot after.",
    "- When doing the Booyah Bomb trial in Judd's trials, the player has the Glooga Dualies.",
    "- The English name comes from the weapons' appearances, which are based on hot glue guns.",
    "- The Japanese name comes from the temperature scale, Kelvin, along with the weapons' damage value after a dodge roll, 52.5.\nWhile the temperature 525 kelvin (about 485째F / 252째C) itself is not notable, it might be a reference to the Draper point in physics, which is at 525째 Celsius. The Draper point is the temperature at which almost all solids will visibly glow as a result of black-body radiation or incandescence.\nIt may also be a reference to high-temperature or dual-temperature glue guns, some models of which operate at temperatures of 252째C (525 K)."
