    "Douser Dualies FF are main weapons in Splatoon 3, made by Custom. They are a pair of dualies with low damage. Shooting while standing, the Douser Dualies have a long range but middling fire rate. They can perform only one dodge roll[1], after which the turret mode activates, dramatically increasing the firing rate at the expense of shorter range and high ink consumption. They also have the farthest dodge rolls of the dualie class.",
    "The Douser Dualies FF appear as a set of dualies with miniature fire extinguishers on the bottom. They have yellow warning labels and instructions on the red canisters, and silver and red nozzles at the firing ends of the dualies. They are designed like the nozzles of firefighting hoses, with switchable nozzles representing the two firing modes.",
    "After dodge rolling, the primary red nozzles compress and the secondary green nozzles attached to the miniature fire extinguishers detach and fall into place below the main nozzle.",
    "The Douser Dualies FF were revealed in the Fresh Season 2024 trailer on 13 February 2024 and released on 1 March 2024. Its kit consists of Ink Mine and the Killer Wail 5.1.",

    "FF likely stands for \"firefighting\", given its extinguisher-like appearance and its names in other languages. FF in hexadecimal also corresponds to the number 255, referencing its maximum damage being 25.5."
