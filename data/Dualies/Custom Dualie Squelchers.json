    "- Before being officially announced, the Custom Dualie Squelchers appeared in the Splatoon 2 version 3.0.0 preview section of the 8 March 2018 Nintendo Direct. They were shown to have Sting Ray as their special weapon in the Direct,[6] but data mining at the time found that they would have Ink Storm (and Splat Bomb as their sub weapon). The data mine ended up being correct, suggesting that the Direct may have included an earlier version of the Custom Dualie Squelchers.",
