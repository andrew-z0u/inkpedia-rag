    "The main weapons in the Glooga Dualies Deco set are just the Glooga Dualies with a new paint job! Ink job? No, paint job was right. This set is more than just a palette swap though-it now comes with a Splash Wall sub weapon that you can quickly retreat behind! And for all you thrill seekers, the Baller special is just the thing to help you bust into enemy turf!",

    "The main weapons in the Glooga Dualies Deco set are just the Glooga Dualies with a new paint job! Ink job? No, paint job was right. While its stats haven't changed, the Point Sensor sub is new. Mark your enemies to track their movements, then get in close with Dodge Rolls to ruin their day! They might try to escape, sure, but a well-aimed Trizooka special will put paid to that. Once you mark an enemy, it's yours to terrorize with your main and special weapons! Happy hunting!",
