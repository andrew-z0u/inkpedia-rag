    "- The English name comes from the weapons' appearance, which is based on hot glue guns (sounds like \"Gloo gans\").",
    "- The Japanese name comes from the temperature scale, Kelvin, along with the weapons' damage value after a dodge roll, 52.5.\nWhile the temperature of 525 kelvin (about 485°F / 252°C) itself is not notable, it might be a reference to the Draper Point in physics, which is at 525°C. The Draper Point is the temperature at which almost all solids will visibly glow as a result of black body radiation or incandescence."
