Ink job? No, paint job was right. This set is more than just a palette swap though-it now comes with a Splash Wall sub weapon that you can quickly retreat behind! And for all you thrill seekers, the Baller special is just the thing to help you bust into enemy turf!\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- An Inkling girl posing with the Glooga Dualies Deco in Camp Triggerfish at night.\n\n- Shooting the Glooga Dualies Deco.\n\n- An Inkling (rightmost) holding a Glooga Dualies Deco.\n\nThe Glooga Dualies Deco returns in Splatoon 3 as part of the Fresh Season 2024 update.

Ink job? No, paint job was right. While its stats haven't changed, the Point Sensor sub is new. Mark your enemies to track their movements, then get in close with Dodge Rolls to ruin their day! They might try to escape, sure, but a well-aimed Trizooka special will put paid to that. Once you mark an enemy, it's yours to terrorize with your main and special weapons!
