    "The Dapple Dualies are a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3, manufactured by Nouveau. It is a dualie with short range but high damage.",
    "Compared to the Splat Dualies, this weapon lets the player perform quicker dodge rolls and inflict more damage, but it has a shorter range and a shorter roll distance to offset its effectiveness in close quarters.",
    "The Dapple Dualies deal enough damage to splat opponents in three hits, unlike the Splat Dualies, Dark Tetra Dualies, Dualie Squelchers and Douser Dualies FF which need to land four hits to splat an enemy. In the post-roll state, the weapon's firing rate is 20% faster than normal, and its accuracy is improved as well.",
    "The Dapple Dualies are built on two main parts, both of which are a berry red color and connected to each other via a black handle. The bottom part of each dualie houses a white and light blue toothbrush, while the top part houses the nozzle, a black pole at the top, and a small metal stick. The upper section looks as if it was build lightweight, for the max mobility. The toothbrush is held in place via a small wire, possibly representing dental floss, that holds it to the stick.",
