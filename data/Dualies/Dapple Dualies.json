In the post-roll state, the weapon's firing rate is 20% faster than normal, and its accuracy is improved as well.\n\nThe Dapple Dualies are built on two main parts, both of which are a berry red color and connected to each other via a black handle. The bottom part of each dualie houses a white and light blue toothbrush, while the top part houses the nozzle, a black pole at the top, and a small metal stick. The upper section looks as if it was build lightweight, for the max mobility. The toothbrush is held in place via a small wire, possibly representing dental floss, that holds it to the stick.\n\nThe Dapple Dualies come with Squid Beakons and Suction-Bomb Launcher.\n\nIt appears in one Octo Expansion station:\n\n- I08 Radio Station\n\n- The Dapple Dualies is a lightweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 95. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The ink consumption of 0.663% and ink tank capacity of 100% allows players to fire 150 shots before needing to refill the ink supply.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- When initially firing the weapon in humanoid form, the first shot takes 3 frames to come out.\n\n- When firing from swim form, the first shot takes 12 frames to come out.\n\n- The interval between firing and when the player is able to enter swim form or use a sub weapon is 4 frames.\n\n- When firing continuously, it shoots a bullet every 5 frames (12 shots per second).\n\n- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.8 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 20 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Each shot has a base damage of 36.\n\n- If a shot is in the air for more than 7 frames after being fired, it loses 2.25 damage per frame until it reaches 18 damage at frame 15.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with players has a radius of 2.5 units.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with the environment has a radius of 2 units.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while on the ground is 7 degrees.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while in the air is 12 degrees.\n\n- The outer reticle immediately expands after jumping.

Shots travel straight for 53.4 distance units.\nAfter that, the shot's velocity is set to 17.635 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and decreases further as it travels.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 17.635 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and decreases further as it travels.\n\n- Ink droplets occur every 110 units.\n\n- The frequency at which ink drips from a shot occurs at a rate of 1 droplets per shot.\n\n- There are a total of 5 different droplet patterns that can be created while firing this weapon.\n\n- Droplets that occur within 11 units of the player have a radius of 18 units, and a width of 10 units.\nThese droplets have their radius multiplied by a value ranging from 1.2 if they fell from a height above 100 units to 1.4 if they fell from a height below 30 units.\n\n- These droplets have their radius multiplied by a value ranging from 1.2 if they fell from a height above 100 units to 1.4 if they fell from a height below 30 units.\n\n- Droplets that occur when they travel past 200 units of the player have a radius of 16.5 units.\n\n- All other ink droplets have a radius of 13.5 units.\n\n- Droplets that are far from the player and all other droplets have their radius multiplied by a value ranging from 1 if they fell from a height above 100 units to 1.2 if they fell from a height below 30 units.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This chance increases by 3% per shot, and maximizes at a 40% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 12 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 17.635 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and decreases further as it travels.\n\n- These droplets have their radius multiplied by a value ranging from 1.2 if they fell from a height above 100 units to 1.4 if they fell from a height below 30 units.\n\n- Each roll consumes 5% of the ink tank capacity.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- The player can roll 2 times without interruption. After this, there is a delay before the player can roll again.\n\n- The Dapple Dualies cannot shoot while rolling. Shots will only fire once the rolling animation is completed.\n\n- After performing a roll, it shoots a bullet every 4 frames.\n\n- After rolling, there is a 50 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Damage output does not change after rolling.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate in the post-roll state is 4 degrees.\n\n- After performing a roll, the two individual reticles will merge into a single reticle and chance to shoot towards the inner reticle is immediately set to 100%.\n\n- The full animation of the roll will last 16 frames before player control resumes.\nUpon regaining control, the player will be forced to maintain their position for 28 frames.\n\n- Upon regaining control, the player will be forced to maintain their position for 28 frames.\n\n- The shot velocity and shot travel distance remains the same in the post-roll state.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- Upon regaining control, the player will be forced to maintain their position for 28 frames.\n\n[1]\n\n- ▲ Decreased duration of down time after performing a dodge roll by 8/60 of a second: 40 frames → 32 frames.\n\n- ▲ Slightly increased the size of hit detection between each shot and the player, making it easier to hit an opponent: 2 units → 3 units.\n\n- ▲ Reduced ink consumption when firing: 0.9% → 0.75%.\n\n- ▲ Reduced the interval between sliding and when the player can use a sub/special weapon by 4/60 of a second: 8 frames → 4 frames.\n\n- ▼ Slightly decreased the size of hit detection between each shot and the player, making it harder to hit an opponent: 3 units → 2.5 units.\n\n- ▲ Points to fill special gauge: 180 → 170.\n\n- ▲ Ink consumption when shooting decreased: 0.75% → 0.6975%.\n\n- ▲ Increased damage dealt to the umbrella portion of the following weapons by roughly 57%: 0.7x → 1.1x.\nTenta Brella\nTenta Sorella Brella\nTenta Camo Brella\n\n- Tenta Brella\n\n- Tenta Sorella Brella\n\n- Tenta Camo Brella\n\n- Tenta Brella\n\n- Tenta Sorella Brella\n\n- Tenta Camo Brella\n\n- ▲ Increased area of ink coverage when shots land by roughly 3%: 16 units → 16.5 units.\n\n- ▲ Decreased ink consumption from shots fired by roughly 5%: 0.6975% → 0.663%.\n\nThe Dapple Dualies are dualie-type weapons that have been obsessively engineered for optimum mobility! They're now lighter, allowing for faster movement, but they have less range. It's a trade-off. Utilize the increased mobility to set Squid Beakons around the map, and call your teammates to your side! And use the Suction-Bomb Launcher to further expand your team's territory! Recommended for players who want to swiftly splat their opponents and support their team!\n\n- Promotional image[2]\n\n- An Inkling firing the Dapple Dualies.\n\nThe Dapple Dualies return in Splatoon 3 with Squid Beakons and the Tacticooler, looking exactly identical to how they did in the previous game.\n\nThey appear in two missions in Return of the Mammalians:\n\n- 0406 Those Aren't Birds\n\n- 0502 The Upside to Enemy Backsides\n\n- The Dapple Dualies is a lightweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 9.5.

They're now lighter, allowing for faster movement, but they have less range. It's a trade-off. But you know what goes well with mobility? Even more mobility! That's where the Tacticooler special shines. Blitz forward with added speed from the Tacticooler, and place Squid Beakons to help your teammates secure forward positions to take advantage of this set. It's not a hit-and-run strategy. It's more like... run-hit-run-run-hit-hit-hit-run...
