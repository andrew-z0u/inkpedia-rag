They appear to be illegitimately modified[1] Splat Dualies.\n\n- 1 Description\n\n- 2 Appearance\n\n- 3 Splatoon 3\n\n3.1 Data\n\n3.1.1 Rolling\n\n\n3.2 Version history\n3.3 Availability\n3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n3.1.1 Rolling\n\n- 3.1.1 Rolling\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Availability\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 4 Trivia\n\n- 5 Names in other languages\n\n- 6 References\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n3.1.1 Rolling\n\n- 3.1.1 Rolling\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Availability\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.1.1 Rolling\n\nThe Grizzco Dualies' normal firing mode have a short range and a wide ink spread, while its range and fire rate after performing a dodge roll is comparable to the Splat Dualies. Its dodge rolls are extremely quick, similar to the Dapple Dualies. The dodge rolls also have explosive properties, which deal damage to Salmonids and inks the ground as the player rolls. The player can perform up to nine dodge rolls in a row, which allows the player to quickly splat Lesser Salmonids and move around easily.\nThe explosive properties are able to splat Flyfish with good timing and correct positioning, and it is able to splat a Fish Stick with only one dodge roll if the player is on top of the pillar. It is also possible to instantly ink a Flipper-Flopper's ring by rolling through it.\n\nThe Grizzco Dualies resemble the regular Splat Dualies, although they've been heavily modified by Mr. Grizz. The muzzle of each weapon is changed to that of a fireman's hose, complete with a cover dangling below. The main body is stripped of paint, though the metal is still hidden by an added black plastic part connecting each weapon to what appears to be 2 yellow prescription pill bottles with white caps, the contents of which unknown. The position of the bottles is mirrored between the two dualies. A portion of the weapon's trigger guard is replaced by a coiled yellow hose tube attached to a large military green valve located near the bottom of the grip. The smaller ink canisters of the Splat Dualies are replaced with rather large ink tanks painted dark brown and decorated with warning signs and a large Grizzco logo sticker.\n\nThe Grizzco Dualies are one of the rare weapons in Salmon Run Next Wave. They were added in version 5.0.0 on 31 August 2023[2], before making their debut on 2 September 2023 at 00:00 UTC during the Big Run on Um'ami Ruins.\n\n- The Grizzco Dualies is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The ink consumption is 0.5% per shot, allowing the user to fire for about 16.67 seconds on a full ink tank.\n\n- When firing continuously, it shoots a bullet every 5 frames (12 shots per second).\n\n- When firing from humanoid form, the first shot takes 3 frames to come out. When firing from swim form, the first shot takes 12 frames to come out.\n\n- The interval between firing the weapon and being able to enter swim form or use a sub weapon is 4 frames.\n\n- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.08 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 20 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Each shot has a base damage of 35 and minimum damage of 30.\n\n- If a shot is in the air for more than 7 frames after being fired, it will lose about 0.63 damage every frame until it reaches 30 damage at frame 15.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with players has a radius of 0.2 units.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with the environment has a radius of 0.2 units.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while on the ground is 13.0 degrees.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while in the air is 18.0 degrees.\n\n- The outer reticle immediately expands after jumping. After 25 frames, the outer reticle will start shrinking, and will finish shrinking after 70 frames.\n\n- The weapon starts off having a 1% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle.\nThis chance increases by 1% per shot, and maximizes at a 25% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 24 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- This chance increases by 1% per shot, and maximizes at a 25% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 24 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- When jumping, the chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle is immediately set to 40%.\n\n- Accuracy starts recovering 5 frames after the player stops shooting. The chance to shoot towards the outer reticle decreases by 0.5% per frame, if the chance is not already at the minimum, meaning that it takes 53 frames to reach maximum accuracy. (83 after shooting while jumping.)\n\n- Shots initially travel straight at a rate of 1.58 units per frame for 2 frames. Shots travel straight for 3.16 distance units.\nAfter that, the shot's velocity is set to 1.58 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 1.58 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- The effective range is about 5.87 units.\nThis number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n- This number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n- This chance increases by 1% per shot, and maximizes at a 25% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 24 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 1.58 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- This number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n- Each roll consumes 7% of the ink tank capacity.\n\n- The user can roll 9 times without interruption. After this, there is a delay before the player can roll again.\n\n- Rolls cover an initial distance of 5.0 units during the rolling animation, plus an additional 1.0 units of sliding afterwards.\n\n- After performing a roll, it shoots a bullet every 4 frames.\nThe ink consumption per shot remains the same, so the player can fire for about 12.33 seconds after rolling once if they have a full ink tank before rolling.\n\n- The ink consumption per shot remains the same, so the player can fire for about 12.33 seconds after rolling once if they have a full ink tank before rolling.\n\n- After rolling, there is a 75 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Damage per shot does not change after rolling.\n\n- After rolling, shots have a radius of 0.25 units.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate in the post-roll state is 1.0 degrees.\n\n- After performing a roll, the two individual reticles will merge into a single reticle. The rate of shot deviation remains the same.\n\n- The Grizzco Dualies cannot shoot while rolling. Shots will only fire once the rolling animation is completed.\n\n- The rolling state can be broken down as follows:\nAfter a 5 frame startup, the roll animation lasts for 10 frames, after which the player can input another roll if they have not yet exhausted all available rolls.\nAfter the roll completes, it takes 4 frames before the weapon can be fired. After an additional 28 frames, the user will regain their rolls and reenter a normal state if they move or stop firing.\nIn total, this takes 47 frames.\n\n- After a 5 frame startup, the roll animation lasts for 10 frames, after which the player can input another roll if they have not yet exhausted all available rolls.\n\n- After the roll completes, it takes 4 frames before the weapon can be fired. After an additional 28 frames, the user will regain their rolls and reenter a normal state if they move or stop firing.\n\n- In total, this takes 47 frames.\n\n- After rolling, shots initially travel straight at a rate of 1.84 units per frame for 4 frames. Shots travel straight for 7.36 distance units.\nAfter that, the shot's velocity is set to 1.6 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 1.6 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- The effective range is about 9.71 units.\nThis number may vary when firing at different angles.\n\n- This number may vary when firing at different angles.\n\n- The Grizzco Dualies causes an explosion when it performs a dodge roll. Targets caught within 4.0 units of the explosion center take 125 damage. Targets caught outside of this radius but inside of the full blast radius of 6.0 units will take between 125 and 40 damage.\n\n- The ink consumption per shot remains the same, so the player can fire for about 12.33 seconds after rolling once if they have a full ink tank before rolling.\n\n- After a 5 frame startup, the roll animation lasts for 10 frames, after which the player can input another roll if they have not yet exhausted all available rolls.\n\n- After the roll completes, it takes 4 frames before the weapon can be fired.
