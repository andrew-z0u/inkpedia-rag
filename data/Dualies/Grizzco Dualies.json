    "The Grizzco Dualies are a Salmon Run Next Wave rare weapon in Splatoon 3. They appear to be illegitimately modified[1] Splat Dualies.",
    "The Grizzco Dualies' normal firing mode have a short range and a wide ink spread, while its range and fire rate after performing a dodge roll is comparable to the Splat Dualies. Its dodge rolls are extremely quick, similar to the Dapple Dualies. The dodge rolls also have explosive properties, which deal damage to Salmonids and inks the ground as the player rolls. The player can perform up to nine dodge rolls in a row, which allows the player to quickly splat Lesser Salmonids and move around easily.\nThe explosive properties are able to splat Flyfish with good timing and correct positioning, and it is able to splat a Fish Stick with only one dodge roll if the player is on top of the pillar. It is also possible to instantly ink a Flipper-Flopper's ring by rolling through it.",
    "The Grizzco Dualies resemble the regular Splat Dualies, although they've been heavily modified by Mr. Grizz. The muzzle of each weapon is changed to that of a fireman's hose, complete with a cover dangling below. The main body is stripped of paint, though the metal is still hidden by an added black plastic part connecting each weapon to what appears to be 2 yellow prescription pill bottles with white caps, the contents of which unknown. The position of the bottles is mirrored between the two dualies. A portion of the weapon's trigger guard is replaced by a coiled yellow hose tube attached to a large military green valve located near the bottom of the grip. The smaller ink canisters of the Splat Dualies are replaced with rather large ink tanks painted dark brown and decorated with warning signs and a large Grizzco logo sticker.",
    "The Grizzco Dualies are one of the rare weapons in Salmon Run Next Wave. They were added in version 5.0.0 on 31 August 2023[2], before making their debut on 2 September 2023 at 00:00 UTC during the Big Run on Um'ami Ruins.",
