    "The Twinklez Splat Dualies is a main weapon in Splatoon 3. It is an Emberz-branded version of the Splat Dualies.",
    "The Twinklez Splat Dualies is similar to the Splat Dualies but with a new color scheme. The sections that were black are now a hot pink and the sections that were green are now a pale gray. The ink tanks are now silver with an Emberz badge on the side.",
    "The Twinklez Splat Dualies come with Fizzy Bomb and Big Bubbler. It was added as part of the Splatlands Collection on 12 June 2025.",
    "[1][2]",
    "Splat Dualies are already a flashy weapon, but Emberz has amped up the flash factor significantly with the Twinklez Splat Dualies. The action in this set is fizzy and light, and I'm not just talking about the Fizzy Bomb sub weapon. Send 'em running just where you want, then Dodge Roll in and finish the job. And if all of that feels like we're neglecting defense in favor of glitzy offense, enter the Big Bubbler, which can help secure key points on the map when activated. Read the action and plot your moves one or even two steps ahead with this set designed for tactical masterminds!",
    "The word twinklez is a stylized spelling of the word twinkles.",
