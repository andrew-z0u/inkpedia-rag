The sections that were black are now a hot pink and the sections that were green are now a pale gray. The ink tanks are now silver with an Emberz badge on the side.\n\nThe Twinklez Splat Dualies come with Fizzy Bomb and Big Bubbler. It was added as part of the Splatlands Collection on 12 June 2025.\n\n- The Twinklez Splat Dualies is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 12.5. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The ink consumption is 0.72% per shot, allowing the user to fire for about 11.5 seconds on a full ink tank.\n\n- When firing continuously, it shoots a bullet every 5 frames (12 shots per second).\n\n- When firing from humanoid form, the first shot takes 3 frames to come out. When firing from swim form, the first shot takes 12 frames to come out.\n\n- The interval between firing the weapon and being able to enter swim form or use a sub weapon is 4 frames.\n\n- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.08 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 20 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Each shot has a base damage of 30 and minimum damage of 15.\n\n- If a shot is in the air for more than 7 frames after being fired, it will lose about 1.88 damage every frame until it reaches 15 damage at frame 15.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with players has a radius of 0.225 units.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with the environment has a radius of 0.2 units.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while on the ground is 2.0 degrees.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while in the air is 7.5 degrees.\n\n- The outer reticle immediately expands after jumping. After 25 frames, the outer reticle will start shrinking, and will finish shrinking after 70 frames.\n\n- The weapon starts off having a 1% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle.\nThis chance increases by 1% per shot, and maximizes at a 25% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 24 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- This chance increases by 1% per shot, and maximizes at a 25% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 24 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- When jumping, the chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle is immediately set to 40%.\n\n- Accuracy starts recovering 5 frames after the player stops shooting. The chance to shoot towards the outer reticle decreases by 0.5% per frame, if the chance is not already at the minimum, meaning that it takes 53 frames to reach maximum accuracy. (83 after shooting while jumping.)\n\n- Shots initially travel straight at a rate of 2.37 units per frame for 3 frames. Shots travel straight for 7.11 distance units.\nAfter that, the shot's velocity is set to 2.3425 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 2.3425 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- The effective range is about 10.8 units.\nThis number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n- This number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n- This chance increases by 1% per shot, and maximizes at a 25% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 24 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 2.3425 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- This number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n- Each roll consumes 7% of the ink tank capacity.\n\n- The user can roll 2 times without interruption. After this, there is a delay before the player can roll again.\n\n- Rolls cover an initial distance of 4.0 units during the rolling animation, plus an additional 1.0 units of sliding afterwards.\n\n- After performing a roll, it shoots a bullet every 4 frames.\nThe ink consumption per shot remains the same, so the player can fire for about 8.6 seconds after rolling once if they have a full ink tank before rolling.\n\n- The ink consumption per shot remains the same, so the player can fire for about 8.6 seconds after rolling once if they have a full ink tank before rolling.\n\n- After rolling, there is a 70 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Damage per shot does not change after rolling.\n\n- After rolling, shots have a radius of 0.25 units.\n\n- Shots cannot deviate from the inner reticle while in the post-roll state.\n\n- After performing a roll, the two individual reticles will merge into a single reticle. The rate of shot deviation remains the same.\n\n- The Twinklez Splat Dualies cannot shoot while rolling. Shots will only fire once the rolling animation is completed.\n\n- The rolling state can be broken down as follows:\nAfter a 4 frame startup, the roll animation lasts for 12 frames, after which the player can input another roll if they have not yet exhausted all available rolls.\nAfter the roll completes, it takes 4 frames before the weapon can be fired. After an additional 28 frames, the user will regain their rolls and reenter a normal state if they move or stop firing.\nIn total, this takes 48 frames.\n\n- After a 4 frame startup, the roll animation lasts for 12 frames, after which the player can input another roll if they have not yet exhausted all available rolls.\n\n- After the roll completes, it takes 4 frames before the weapon can be fired. After an additional 28 frames, the user will regain their rolls and reenter a normal state if they move or stop firing.\n\n- In total, this takes 48 frames.\n\n- The shot velocity and shot travel distance remains the same in the post-roll state.\n\n- Rolling creates a pool of ink with a radius of 1.8 units.\n\n- The ink consumption per shot remains the same, so the player can fire for about 8.6 seconds after rolling once if they have a full ink tank before rolling.\n\n- After a 4 frame startup, the roll animation lasts for 12 frames, after which the player can input another roll if they have not yet exhausted all available rolls.\n\n- After the roll completes, it takes 4 frames before the weapon can be fired.

The action in this set is fizzy and light, and I'm not just talking about the Fizzy Bomb sub weapon. Send 'em running just where you want, then Dodge Roll in and finish the job. And if all of that feels like we're neglecting defense in favor of glitzy offense, enter the Big Bubbler, which can help secure key points on the map when activated. Read the action and plot your moves one or even two steps ahead with this set designed for tactical masterminds!\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- Promotional artwork for Land vs. Sea vs. Air\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Twinklez_Splat_Dualies_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nModel of the Twinklez Splat Dualies rotating (link to file)\n\nThe word twinklez is a stylized spelling of the word twinkles."
