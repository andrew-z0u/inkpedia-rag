    "The Splat Dualies are a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3, manufactured by Splat. It is a dualie, a type of weapon that are paired sets of guns that give their user the ability to dodge roll.",
    "When fired, the Splat Dualies spray ink from two weapons, one in each of the player's hands. Two reticles are displayed as a result, and each reticle acts independently, so obstruction of one dualie does not inhibit the shots of the other. While crouched in a dodge roll, the player's reticles are merged and shots are concentrated on one point; however, walking is disabled. Rolls may be used up to two times consecutively before the player must stand again.",
    "Each of the Splat Dualies has an ink tank connected to a nozzle via a black and green handle, which appears to be made of plastic. The ink tank changes color to match the user's ink, while the nozzle is green with pink highlights. There is also a small tube that connects the ink tank to the nozzle. Both of the Splat Dualies are not identical, instead being mirrored. This is most noticeable with the small green valve present near the trigger, which is present on one side of the dualie but not the other. The Splat Dualies are relatively small compared to most other weapons.",
