Two reticles are displayed as a result, and each reticle acts independently, so obstruction of one dualie does not inhibit the shots of the other. While crouched in a dodge roll, the player's reticles are merged and shots are concentrated on one point; however, walking is disabled. Rolls may be used up to two times consecutively before the player must stand again.\n\nEach of the Splat Dualies has an ink tank connected to a nozzle via a black and green handle, which appears to be made of plastic. The ink tank changes color to match the user's ink, while the nozzle is green with pink highlights. There is also a small tube that connects the ink tank to the nozzle. Both of the Splat Dualies are not identical, instead being mirrored. This is most noticeable with the small green valve present near the trigger, which is present on one side of the dualie but not the other. The Splat Dualies are relatively small compared to most other weapons.\n\nThe Splat Dualies come with Burst Bombs and Tenta Missiles.\n\nIt appears in two Octo Expansion stations:\n\n- D10 Labyrinth Station\n\n- J03 D08 Girl Power Station (canned)\n\n- The Splat Dualies is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 125. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The ink consumption of 0.72% and ink tank capacity of 100% allows players to fire 138 shots before needing to refill the ink supply.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- When initially firing the weapon in humanoid form, the first shot takes 3 frames to come out.\n\n- When firing from swim form, the first shot takes 12 frames to come out.\n\n- The interval between firing and when the player is able to enter swim form or use a sub weapon is 4 frames.\n\n- When firing continuously, it shoots a bullet every 5 frames (12 shots per second).\n\n- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.8 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 20 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Each shot has a base damage of 30.\n\n- If a shot is in the air for more than 7 frames after being fired, it loses 1.875 damage per frame until it reaches 15 damage at frame 15.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with players has a radius of 2 units.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with the environment has a radius of 2 units.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while on the ground is 2 degrees.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while in the air is 7.5 degrees.\n\n- The outer reticle immediately expands after jumping. After 25 frames, the outer reticle will start shrinking, and will finish shrinking after 70 frames.\n\n- The Splat Dualies starts off having a 1% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle.\nThis chance increases by 1% per shot, and maximizes at a 25% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 24 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- This chance increases by 1% per shot, and maximizes at a 25% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 24 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- When jumping, the chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle is immediately set to 40%.\n\n- Accuracy starts recovering 5 frames after the player stops shooting. The chance to shoot towards the outer reticle decreases by 0.5% per frame, if the chance is not already at the minimum, meaning that it takes 53 frames to reach maximum accuracy. (83 after shooting while jumping.)\n\n- Shots initially travel straight at a rate of 23.7 units per frame for 3 frames. Shots travel straight for 71.1 distance units.\nAfter that, the shot's velocity is set to 23.425 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and decreases further as it travels.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 23.425 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and decreases further as it travels.\n\n- Ink droplets occur every 140 units.\n\n- The frequency at which ink drips from a shot occurs at a rate of 1 droplets per shot.\n\n- There are a total of 7 different droplet patterns that can be created while firing this weapon.\n\n- Droplets that occur within 11 units of the player have a radius of 16 units, and a width of 10 units.\nThese droplets have their radius multiplied by a value ranging from 1.2 if they fell from a height above 100 units to 1.4 if they fell from a height below 30 units.\n\n- These droplets have their radius multiplied by a value ranging from 1.2 if they fell from a height above 100 units to 1.4 if they fell from a height below 30 units.\n\n- Droplets that occur when they travel past 200 units of the player have a radius of 15.5 units.\n\n- All other ink droplets have a radius of 13.55 units.\n\n- Droplets that are far from the player and all other droplets have their radius multiplied by a value ranging from 1 if they fell from a height above 100 units to 1.2 if they fell from a height below 30 units.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This chance increases by 1% per shot, and maximizes at a 25% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 24 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 23.425 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and decreases further as it travels.\n\n- These droplets have their radius multiplied by a value ranging from 1.2 if they fell from a height above 100 units to 1.4 if they fell from a height below 30 units.\n\n- Each roll consumes 7% of the ink tank capacity.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- The player can roll 2 times without interruption. After this, there is a delay before the player can roll again.\n\n- The Splat Dualies cannot shoot while rolling.

But there's some real substance behind the style... The propulsive exhaust nozzles on each weapon allow you to perform a high-speed Dodge Roll!As a trade-off, you won't be able to move for a brief moment after executing this move. But during that time, the two weapon sights overlap, increasing your splatting power.Paired with Suction Bombs as your sub weapon, this loadout might SEEM as though it's lacking in power...then BOOM. You realize you have the Crab Tank.
