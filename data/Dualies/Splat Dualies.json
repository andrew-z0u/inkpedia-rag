    "The Splat Dualies are a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3, manufactured by Splat. It is a dualie, a type of weapon that are paired sets of guns that give their user the ability to dodge roll.",
    "When fired, the Splat Dualies spray ink from two weapons, one in each of the player's hands. Two reticles are displayed as a result, and each reticle acts independently, so obstruction of one dualie does not inhibit the shots of the other. While crouched in a dodge roll, the player's reticles are merged and shots are concentrated on one point; however, walking is disabled. Rolls may be used up to two times consecutively before the player must stand again.",
    "Each of the Splat Dualies has an ink tank connected to a nozzle via a black and green handle, which appears to be made of plastic. The ink tank changes color to match the user's ink, while the nozzle is green with pink highlights. There is also a small tube that connects the ink tank to the nozzle. Both of the Splat Dualies are not identical, instead being mirrored. This is most noticeable with the small green valve present near the trigger, which is present on one side of the dualie but not the other. The Splat Dualies are relatively small compared to most other weapons.",
    "The Splat Dualies come with Burst Bombs and Tenta Missiles.",
    "It appears in two Octo Expansion stations:",

    "The main is the Splat Dualies, a pair of dualie-type weapons born from the culture of Turf War!You carry one in each hand, which is pretty sweet, and their propulsive exhaust nozzles allow you to perform a high-speed dodge roll!You can't move for a brief period immediately after rolling, but the two sights overlap during that time, increasing your splatting power.The included Burst Bombs have great damage output, and you can hit far-off opponents with the Tenta Missiles!It's a really solid set!",
    "The Splat Dualies return in Splatoon 3, looking identical to the previous game. Its kit consists of Suction Bombs and the Crab Tank.",
    "It appears in one mission in Return of the Mammalians:",
    "[3][4]",
    "Here we have the Splat Dualies, a dualie weapon born from the \"ink hard or get splatted trying\" culture of Turf War battles!These are dual-wielding, pistol-type weapons that—let's be honest—look pretty sweet. But there's some real substance behind the style... The propulsive exhaust nozzles on each weapon allow you to perform a high-speed Dodge Roll!As a trade-off, you won't be able to move for a brief moment after executing this move. But during that time, the two weapon sights overlap, increasing your splatting power.Paired with Suction Bombs as your sub weapon, this loadout might SEEM as though it's lacking in power...then BOOM. You realize you have the Crab Tank. All hail Crab Tank!",
