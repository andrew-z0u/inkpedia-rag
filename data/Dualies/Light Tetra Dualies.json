    "The Light Tetra Dualies are a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3. They are a variant of the Dark Tetra Dualies with a different look and loadout.",
    "The Light Tetra Dualies are similar in appearance to the Dark Tetra Dualies. However, the black part of the Light Tetra Dualies is white, and the front part has scarlet-colored highlights instead of purple and green.",
    "The Light Tetra Dualies were released on 1 August 2018 at 00:00 UTC.[1] It comes with Sprinkler and Autobomb Launcher.",
    "[2]",
    "The Light Tetra Dualies have the same specs as the dark ones, but they come in a set geared toward turf inkage! Toss out a Sprinkler to ink the area around your team while you dodge-roll your way to the front lines! Once you're up there, support your allies with the Autobomb Launcher and push the enemy back into their base! This set's just the thing for those who value mobility but also want to cover the world in ink!",
    "The Light Tetra Dualies return in Splatoon 3 as part of the Sizzle Season 2023. Its kit consists of Sprinkler and Zipcaster.",
    "[3][4]",
    "The Light Tetra Dualies have the same specs as the dark ones, but they come in a set geared toward turf inkage! So what does that mean? Well, try leaving the inking to the Sprinkler sub while you Dodge Roll straight toward the front lines. Then, when your Zipcaster special is ready, you can fly around enemy turf sowing chaos and confusion! It's all a bit like taping an extra turbo to a vehicle that has five turbos already. Excessive? Perhaps! But if you have the need for speed, give it a shot.",
