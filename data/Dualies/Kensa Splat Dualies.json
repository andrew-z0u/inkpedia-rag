Unlike the Splat Dualies and the Enperry Splat Dualies, the ink reservoirs of the Kensa Splat Dualies do not change with the user's ink color and are always black.",

    "- An Inkling girl with the Kensa Splat Dualies",
    "- In the version 4.0.0 trailer, an Octoling holding this weapon is shown without shoes. The reason for this is likely because the Toni Kensa brand only has three different shoes, and all three were already taken."
