The insides of the Dualie Squelchers are now a light blue denim pattern while the outsides have a black and white color pattern similar to a zebra. The right Dualie Squelcher has a ring with six spikes added on the nozzle.\n\nThe Hoofz Dualie Squelchers comes with Point Sensor and Splattercolor Screen.\n\n- The Hoofz Dualie Squelchers is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 17. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The ink consumption is 1.2% per shot, allowing the user to fire for about 8.3 seconds on a full ink tank.\n\n- When firing continuously, it shoots a bullet every 6 frames (10 shots per second).\n\n- When firing from humanoid form, the first shot takes 3 frames to come out. When firing from swim form, the first shot takes 12 frames to come out.\n\n- The interval between firing the weapon and being able to enter swim form or use a sub weapon is 4 frames.\n\n- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.072 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 20 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Each shot has a base damage of 28 and minimum damage of 14.\n\n- If a shot is in the air for more than 9 frames after being fired, it will lose about 0.88 damage every frame until it reaches 14 damage at frame 25.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with players has a radius of 0.2 units.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with the environment has a radius of 0.2 units.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while on the ground is 4.0 degrees.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while in the air is 8.0 degrees.\n\n- The outer reticle immediately expands after jumping. After 25 frames, the outer reticle will start shrinking, and will finish shrinking after 70 frames.\n\n- The weapon starts off having a 4% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle.\nThis chance increases by 2% per shot, and maximizes at a 30% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 13 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- This chance increases by 2% per shot, and maximizes at a 30% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 13 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- When jumping, the chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle is immediately set to 40%.\n\n- Accuracy starts recovering 6 frames after the player stops shooting. The chance to shoot towards the outer reticle decreases by 1% per frame, if the chance is not already at the minimum, meaning that it takes 32 frames to reach maximum accuracy. (42 after shooting while jumping.)\n\n- Shots initially travel straight at a rate of 2.3 units per frame for 5 frames. Shots travel straight for 11.5 distance units.\nAfter that, the shot's velocity is set to 2.2698 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 2.2698 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- The effective range is about 15.06 units.\nThis number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n- This number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n- This chance increases by 2% per shot, and maximizes at a 30% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 13 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 2.2698 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- This number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n- Each roll consumes 8% of the ink tank capacity.\n\n- The user can roll 2 times without interruption. After this, there is a delay before the player can roll again.\n\n- Rolls cover an initial distance of 3.5 units during the rolling animation, plus an additional 1.0 units of sliding afterwards.\n\n- After performing a roll, it shoots a bullet every 6 frames.\nThe ink consumption per shot remains the same, so the player can fire for about 7.6 seconds after rolling once if they have a full ink tank before rolling.\n\n- The ink consumption per shot remains the same, so the player can fire for about 7.6 seconds after rolling once if they have a full ink tank before rolling.\n\n- After rolling, there is a 60 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Damage per shot does not change after rolling.\n\n- After rolling, shots have a radius of 0.25 units.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate in the post-roll state is 2.0 degrees.\n\n- After performing a roll, the two individual reticles will merge into a single reticle. The rate of shot deviation remains the same.\n\n- The Hoofz Dualie Squelchers cannot shoot while rolling. Shots will only fire once the rolling animation is completed.\n\n- The rolling state can be broken down as follows:\nAfter a 4 frame startup, the roll animation lasts for 12 frames, after which the player can input another roll if they have not yet exhausted all available rolls.\nAfter the roll completes, it takes 8 frames before the user can fire the weapon or move. After an additional 24 frames, the user will regain their rolls and reenter a normal state if they move or stop firing.\nIn total, this takes 48 frames.\n\n- After a 4 frame startup, the roll animation lasts for 12 frames, after which the player can input another roll if they have not yet exhausted all available rolls.\n\n- After the roll completes, it takes 8 frames before the user can fire the weapon or move. After an additional 24 frames, the user will regain their rolls and reenter a normal state if they move or stop firing.\n\n- In total, this takes 48 frames.\n\n- The shot velocity and shot travel distance remains the same in the post-roll state.\n\n- Rolling creates a pool of ink with a radius of 1.8 units.\n\n- The ink consumption per shot remains the same, so the player can fire for about 7.6 seconds after rolling once if they have a full ink tank before rolling.\n\n- After a 4 frame startup, the roll animation lasts for 12 frames, after which the player can input another roll if they have not yet exhausted all available rolls.\n\n- After the roll completes, it takes 8 frames before the user can fire the weapon or move.

Especially since the inclusion of the Point Sensor sub and Splattercolor Screen special are designed to work in tandem to limit your opponents' ability to submerge. Choose this set if you want to be a leader on the battlefield, creating advantageous situations for your teammates to exploit.\n\n- 2D icon\n\nThe word hoofz is a stylized spelling of the word hooves, which matches the zebra-print pattern on the weapon bodies thematically."
