    "The Dapple Dualies Nouveau are a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3. They are the Nouveau branded version of the Dapple Dualies.",
    "The Dapple Dualies Nouveau share their builds with the Dapple Dualies. However, the Dapple Dualies Nouveau are mainly dark blue and have a sticker bearing the Nouveau logo on the top of each dualie.",
    "The Dapple Dualies Nouveau were released on 13 January 2018 at 02:00 UTC.[1]. They come with the sub Toxic Mist and the special Ink Storm.",
    "[2]",
    "The main weapons of the Dapple Dualies Nouveau set are the same Dapple Dualies you know and love... with a bit of artistic flourish.\nSlow foes with the Toxic Mist sub before dodge-rolling into range and splatting it up!\nThe Ink Storm special is handy for turning the tide of battle in your favor. Use it to sow chaos, and then reap the rewards!",
    "The Dapple Dualies Nouveau return in Splatoon 3. Its special is Reefslider and its sub weapon is the Torpedo.",
    "[3][4]",
    "The trouble with the Dapple Dualies Nouveau is that you'll be whizzing through the stage so fast with them that no one will be able to appreciate their cool design! As weapons, though, they're pretty good. Just like the Dapple Dualies you know and love already. But now equipped with the Torpedo sub to distract and annoy your enemies! And for those times when foes are bunching up and you need something with more oomph, kick the Reefslider into gear and splat 'em all at once. If you're good at reading the map and making your own plan of attack, this loadout is a great choice!",
