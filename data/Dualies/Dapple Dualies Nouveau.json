They come with the sub Toxic Mist and the special Ink Storm.\n\n- The Dapple Dualies Nouveau is a lightweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 95. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The ink consumption of 0.663% and ink tank capacity of 100% allows players to fire 150 shots before needing to refill the ink supply.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- When initially firing the weapon in humanoid form, the first shot takes 3 frames to come out.\n\n- When firing from swim form, the first shot takes 12 frames to come out.\n\n- The interval between firing and when the player is able to enter swim form or use a sub weapon is 4 frames.\n\n- When firing continuously, it shoots a bullet every 5 frames (12 shots per second).\n\n- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.8 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 20 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Each shot has a base damage of 36.\n\n- If a shot is in the air for more than 7 frames after being fired, it loses 2.25 damage per frame until it reaches 18 damage at frame 15.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with players has a radius of 2.5 units.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with the environment has a radius of 2 units.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while on the ground is 7 degrees.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while in the air is 12 degrees.\n\n- The outer reticle immediately expands after jumping.

Shots will only fire once the rolling animation is completed.\n\n- The rolling state can be broken down as follows:\nAfter a 4 frame startup, the roll animation lasts for 8 frames, after which the player can input another roll if they have not yet exhausted all available rolls.\nAfter the roll completes, it takes 4 frames before the weapon can be fired. After an additional 24 frames, the user will regain their rolls and reenter a normal state if they move or stop firing.\nIn total, this takes 40 frames.\n\n- After a 4 frame startup, the roll animation lasts for 8 frames, after which the player can input another roll if they have not yet exhausted all available rolls.\n\n- After the roll completes, it takes 4 frames before the weapon can be fired.

After an additional 24 frames, the user will regain their rolls and reenter a normal state if they move or stop firing.\n\n- In total, this takes 40 frames.\n\n[3][4]\n\n- ▲ Shortened the amount of time it takes for a player to be able to act after a Dodge Roll by roughly .06 seconds: 32 frames → 28 frames.\n\n- ▲ Movement speed while firing is now about 5% faster: 0.08 units/frame → 0.084 units/frame.\n\n- ▲ Damage dealt to Splash Wall increased by about 10%: 1x → 1.1x.\n\n- ▲ Increased the speed of shots by approximately 3% and extended the flight distance.\nInitial velocity: 1.78 units/frame → 1.8334 units/frame.\nVelocity after 3 frames: 1.7635 units/frame → 1.81641 units/frame.\n\n- Initial velocity: 1.78 units/frame → 1.8334 units/frame.\n\n- Velocity after 3 frames: 1.7635 units/frame → 1.81641 units/frame.\n\n- — Reduced the angle of the scatter of shots to compensate for the increase in range.\nWhile on land: 7 degrees → 6.8 degrees.\nWhile jumping: 12 degrees → 11.66 degrees.\nAfter a Dodge Roll: 4 degrees → 3.89 degrees.\n\n- While on land: 7 degrees → 6.8 degrees.\n\n- While jumping: 12 degrees → 11.66 degrees.\n\n- After a Dodge Roll: 4 degrees → 3.89 degrees.\n\n- Initial velocity: 1.78 units/frame → 1.8334 units/frame.\n\n- Velocity after 3 frames: 1.7635 units/frame → 1.81641 units/frame.\n\n- While on land: 7 degrees → 6.8 degrees.\n\n- While jumping: 12 degrees → 11.66 degrees.\n\n- After a Dodge Roll: 4 degrees → 3.89 degrees.\n\nThe trouble with the Dapple Dualies Nouveau is that you'll be whizzing through the stage so fast with them that no one will be able to appreciate their cool design! As weapons, though, they're pretty good. Just like the Dapple Dualies you know and love already. But now equipped with the Torpedo sub to distract and annoy your enemies! And for those times when foes are bunching up and you need something with more oomph, kick the Reefslider into gear and splat 'em all at once. If you're good at reading the map and making your own plan of attack, this loadout is a great choice!\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- An Inkling holding the Dapple Dualies Nouveau.\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Dapple Dualies Nouveau.\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Dapple_Dualies_Nouveau.mp4\n\n\nModel of the Dapple Dualies Nouveau rotating (link to file)\n\n- There are toothbrushes on the ends of the guns, likely referencing the fact that toothbrushes are used to make realistic splatter marks known as \"dapples\" on paintings.\n\n- The sticker used for the Dapple Dualies Nouveau's icon is different in the games it appears in.
