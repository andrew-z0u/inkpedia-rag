The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The ink consumption of 0.72% and ink tank capacity of 100% allows players to fire 138 shots before needing to refill the ink supply.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- When initially firing the weapon in humanoid form, the first shot takes 3 frames to come out.\n\n- When firing from swim form, the first shot takes 12 frames to come out.\n\n- The interval between firing and when the player is able to enter swim form or use a sub weapon is 4 frames.\n\n- When firing continuously, it shoots a bullet every 5 frames (12 shots per second).\n\n- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.8 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 20 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Each shot has a base damage of 30.\n\n- If a shot is in the air for more than 7 frames after being fired, it loses 1.875 damage per frame until it reaches 15 damage at frame 15.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with players has a radius of 2 units.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with the environment has a radius of 2 units.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while on the ground is 2 degrees.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while in the air is 7.5 degrees.\n\n- The outer reticle immediately expands after jumping. After 25 frames, the outer reticle will start shrinking, and will finish shrinking after 70 frames.\n\n- The Enperry Splat Dualies starts off having a 1% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle.\nThis chance increases by 1% per shot, and maximizes at a 25% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 24 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- This chance increases by 1% per shot, and maximizes at a 25% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 24 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- When jumping, the chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle is immediately set to 40%.\n\n- Accuracy starts recovering 5 frames after the player stops shooting.
