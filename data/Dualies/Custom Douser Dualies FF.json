    "The Custom Douser Dualies FF are main weapons in Splatoon 3. It is a Custom branded variant of the Douser Dualies FF with a different kit and design.",
    "The Custom Douser Dualies FF made their debut in Sizzle Season 2024. Its kit consists of Burst Bomb and Triple Inkstrike.

    "The Custom Douser Dualies FF is a variant of the Douser Dualies FF with a new look and some new components. If the pre-Dodge Roll fire isn't fast enough for you, break out the Burst Bomb! It's perfect for finishing the job after an opening volley. Meanwhile, you have a Triple Inkstrike special to flush foes out of strategic positions, or for some momentary obscurement while charging in. If you want to go full aggro, this kit will get you there! I recommend it to wielders with the courage to stand undaunted in the heat of battle!",
