Its appearance is similar to that of the Splat Dualies. When firing, ring-shaped holograms manifest around both Dualies.\n\nThe Order Dualies are the first weapon to be unlocked in  Side Order and are part of Pearl's Palette. Their base set consists of Curling Bombs and Reefslider. However, this can be changed in the Spire of Order by using a vending machine.\n\nThey have lower stats in comparison to the Splat Dualies, with lower fire rate, damage, strafe speed, ink efficiency, range, and only one dodge roll. However, this can be upgraded through color chips in the Spire of Order.\n\n- Tableturf Battle card art\n\n- The clear screen for the Order Dualies\n\n- The fail screen for the Order Dualies"
