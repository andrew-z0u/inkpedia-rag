    "The Flingza Roller is a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3.",
    "The Flingza Roller is capable of long-range vertical swings like the Dynamo Roller, while not having to share its low mobility. As a trade-off, its damage at long range is lower than the Dynamo Roller. For horizontal swings, the swing speed and damage of the Flingza Roller are between the Carbon Roller and the Splat Roller. Like other roller-type weapons, the Flingza Roller can be pushed along the ground to cover turf while moving, and only needs one well-aimed ink fling attack to splat an opponent.",
    "Like most rollers, the Flingza Roller has two main parts; the handle and the roller. Both parts appear to fold out of a metallic rectangular frame that resembles a Swiss Army knife (this resemblance can be seen even more strongly in its The Art of Splatoon 2 concept art). The handle is a simple U-shaped piece of metal with black grips. The roller part consists of a cylindrical body (resembling a pen cap) with a fountain pen nib attached. When the user performs a horizontal swing or a roll, the nib gets covered by a retractable cylindrical cover. The roller part is attached to the right side of the rectangular frame via some metal supports.",
    "The Flingza Roller debuted in Splatoon 2 with Splash Walls and the Splat-Bomb Launcher.",
    "The vertical swing on the Flingza Roller has a unique characteristic of sending ink droplets to the left and right. These droplets do not do damage but do ink turf.",
