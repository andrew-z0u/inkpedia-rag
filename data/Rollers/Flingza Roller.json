  "content": "The Flingza Roller is a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3.\n\nThe Flingza Roller is capable of long-range vertical swings like the Dynamo Roller, while not having to share its low mobility. As a trade-off, its damage at long range is lower than the Dynamo Roller. For horizontal swings, the swing speed and damage of the Flingza Roller are between the Carbon Roller and the Splat Roller. Like other roller-type weapons, the Flingza Roller can be pushed along the ground to cover turf while moving, and only needs one well-aimed ink fling attack to splat an opponent.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Splatoon 2\n\n2.1 Data\n\n2.1.1 Horizontal swing (while grounded)\n2.1.2 Vertical swing (while in midair)\n\n\n2.2 Version history\n2.3 Quotes\n2.4 Gallery\n2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n2.1.1 Horizontal swing (while grounded)\n2.1.2 Vertical swing (while in midair)\n\n- 2.1.1 Horizontal swing (while grounded)\n\n- 2.1.2 Vertical swing (while in midair)\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3 Splatoon 3\n\n3.1 Data\n\n3.1.1 Horizontal swing (while grounded)\n3.1.2 Vertical swing (while in midair)\n\n\n3.2 Version history\n3.3 Quotes\n3.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n3.5 Gallery\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n3.1.1 Horizontal swing (while grounded)\n3.1.2 Vertical swing (while in midair)\n\n- 3.1.1 Horizontal swing (while grounded)\n\n- 3.1.2 Vertical swing (while in midair)\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 3.5 Gallery\n\n- 4 Strategy\n\n- 5 Trivia\n\n- 6 Names in other languages\n\n- 7 References\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n2.1.1 Horizontal swing (while grounded)\n2.1.2 Vertical swing (while in midair)\n\n- 2.1.1 Horizontal swing (while grounded)\n\n- 2.1.2 Vertical swing (while in midair)\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 2.1.1 Horizontal swing (while grounded)\n\n- 2.1.2 Vertical swing (while in midair)\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n3.1.1 Horizontal swing (while grounded)\n3.1.2 Vertical swing (while in midair)\n\n- 3.1.1 Horizontal swing (while grounded)\n\n- 3.1.2 Vertical swing (while in midair)\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 3.5 Gallery\n\n- 3.1.1 Horizontal swing (while grounded)\n\n- 3.1.2 Vertical swing (while in midair)\n\nLike most rollers, the Flingza Roller has two main parts; the handle and the roller. Both parts appear to fold out of a metallic rectangular frame that resembles a Swiss Army knife (this resemblance can be seen even more strongly in its The Art of Splatoon 2 concept art). The handle is a simple U-shaped piece of metal with black grips. The roller part consists of a cylindrical body (resembling a pen cap) with a fountain pen nib attached. When the user performs a horizontal swing or a roll, the nib gets covered by a retractable cylindrical cover. The roller part is attached to the right side of the rectangular frame via some metal supports.\n\nThe Flingza Roller debuted in Splatoon 2 with Splash Walls and the Splat-Bomb Launcher.\n\nThe vertical swing on the Flingza Roller has a unique characteristic of sending ink droplets to the left and right. These droplets do not do damage but do ink turf.\n\nIt appears in two Octo Expansion stations:\n\n- B13 Phat Splatz Station\n\n- B14 Breakdance Station\n\n- The Flingza Roller is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 140. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- Ink consumption per second while rolling scales from 1.2% to 6% depending on the rolling speed.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- When rolling, the player's movement speed is set to 1.08 units per frame.\n\n- After rolling for 1 second, the player begins to dash.\n\n- When dashing, the player's movement speed is set to 1.32 units per frame.\n\n- After rolling, there is a 0.33 second cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Hitting an opponent while rolling deals 125 damage. Main Power Up increases rolling contact damage up to 143.75.\n\n- When rolling, the Flingza Roller leaves an ink trail that is 52 units wide.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- The ink consumption of 8% allows players to attack 12 times before needing to refill the ink supply.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- When attacking with a nearly depleted ink tank, the ink consumption of that attack is reduced to 4%. The damage of that attack is reduced to 25% of the normal amount.\n\n- When attacking, it takes 19 frames to lift the roller (0.32 seconds).\n\n- When attacking while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.72 units per frame.\n\n- After swinging, there is a 0.75 second cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Attacks have a base damage of 150. Main Power Up increases damage up to 172.5.\n\n- For normal attacks, ink loses damage based on distance traveled. Ink starts losing damage at 50 units and stops losing damage at 117.6923 units.

Main Power Up increases minimum damage up to 34.5.\n\n- The lethal range is 80 units, as this is the farthest distance where ink deals 100 damage.\n\n- In situations where ink falls down, the ink will lose damage as it falls. The minimum damage for falling ink is 15.\n\n- Ink flung from the center of the roller does the greatest damage. Ink that is flung at an angle greater than 12 degrees to the left or right will have lower damage. This low-damage ink starts losing damage after traveling a distance of 28 units and stops losing damage at 90 units. The maximum damage is 100 and the minimum damage is 30. Main Power Up increases maximum damage up to 115 and increases minimum damage up to 34.5.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- The ink consumption of 12% allows players to attack 8 times before needing to refill the ink supply.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- When attacking with a nearly depleted ink tank, the ink consumption of that attack is reduced to 6%.

Its shape changes depending on whether you swing vertically or horizontally! It allows for quick horizontal ink flings before switching to a vertical fling-like SWISH, SPLAT! Use the Splash Wall sub to create some safety then send your team to the front line by laying down an ink path with a vertical swing. Protect your friends that to the front with the Splat-Bomb Launcher!\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- An Inkling flinging ink with the Flingza Roller\n\n- The Flingza Roller immediately after hitting the ground, demonstrating its horizontal swing\n\nThe Flingza Roller returns in Splatoon 3 with Ink Mine and Tenta Missiles as its kit.\n\nIt appears in two missions in Return of the Mammalians:\n\n- 0305 Conveyor-Belt Tightening\n\n- 0602 Octarian Heights\n\n- The Flingza Roller is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 14.

The minimum damage before time-based falloff is applied is 30.\n\n- The lethal range is 7.2 units, as this is the farthest distance where ink deals 100 damage.\n\n- If a glob of ink is in the air for more than 24 frames after being flung, it loses damage each frame until frame 44, at which point it will deal 50% of its original damage. Thus, the minimum damage that can be dealt per glob is is 15.\n\n- Ink flung from the center of the roller does the greatest damage. Ink that is flung at an angle greater than 15.0 degrees to the left or right will have lower damage.

Its shape changes depending on whether you swing vertically or horizontally! I won't get too technical, but the automatic centrifugal clutch allows for light horizontal swings that go FLOOSH and heavier vertical swings that are more like GLOMP! The bottom line is that you can control the action. Use the vertical swing to lay down a path, then take down nearby opponents with the quick strike of a horizontal swing. While you're zipping around, you can also lay down Ink Mines to help sniff out opponents and fire off some Tenta Missiles for a one-two punch. If you're up to the challenge of simply dominating a match, then you should give this set a try!\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- Tableturf Battle card art\n\nFor competitive tips about the Flingza Roller\n\n- The Flingza Roller and its variant, the Foil Flingza Roller, are the only rollers to have its frame connect to the right side of the roller cover."
