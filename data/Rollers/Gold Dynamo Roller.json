However, the Gold Dynamo Roller is entirely gold, except for the tubes and the roller, which change color to match the user's ink. In Splatoon, the gold color is shinier, while in Splatoon 2, the color is duller.\n\nThe Gold Dynamo Roller comes with Splat Bombs and the Inkstrike.\n\nLike the Dynamo Roller, the Gold Dynamo Roller can only be purchased after collecting the Sunken Scroll from the Octo Valley mission Enter the Octobot King!.\n\n- The Gold Dynamo Roller is a heavyweight weapon.\n\n- Ink consumption while rolling is 6% per second.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- Ink consumption per attack is 20%.\nThis allows players to attack 5 times before needing to refill the ink supply.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This allows players to attack 5 times before needing to refill the ink supply.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- The weapon can attack with a depleted ink tank, but the damage of that attack is reduced to 40% of the normal amount.\n\n- Rolling with a depleted ink tank will not leave a trail or damage opponents.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This allows players to attack 5 times before needing to refill the ink supply.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- When attacking, it takes 45 frames to lift the roller (0.75 seconds).\n\n- When rolling, the player's movement speed is set to 0.96 units per frame.\n\n- When rolling on an uninkable surface or with a depleted ink tank, the player's movement speed is set to 0.96 units per frame.\n\n- After rolling, there is a 0.33 second cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- After swinging, there is a 1.33 second cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Hitting an opponent while rolling deals 160 damage.\n\n- Attacks have a base damage of 125.\n\n- For normal attacks, ink loses damage based on distance traveled. Ink starts losing damage at 110 units and stops losing damage at 170 units. The minimum damage is 25.\n\n- Ink globs travel straight for 6 frames.\n\n- Ink flung from the center of the roller does the greatest damage. Ink that flies to the left or right will have lower damage. This low-damage ink starts losing damage after traveling a distance of 155 units and stops losing damage at 170 units. The maximum damage is 50 and the minimum damage is 25.\n\n- When rolling, the Gold Dynamo Roller leaves an ink trail that is 60 units wide.\n\n[1]\n\n- ▼ Amount of time needed before the ink begins filling after swinging the roller increased.\n\n- ▼ Players can only splat their opponents in one hit if they hit with the center of the roller.\n\n- ▼ Opponents cannot be splatted in one hit when the player is out of ink.\n\n- — Calculation method for damage when the roller is repeatedly swung modified.\n\n- ▼ Special gauge loss: 50% → 75%.\n\n- ▼ Swim speed decreased by about 10%.\n\n- ▼ When using the ink fling attack, decreased the central zone in which it was possible to splat an opponent with a single attack by 18%.\n\n- ▲ Increased damage dealt when flinging ink to attack the barrier around the Rainmaker in Rainmaker mode by 12%.\n\n- ▼ Time taken to begin recovering ink after ink fling attack: 1.17 seconds → 1.33 seconds.\n\nThe Gold Dynamo Roller is another roller I designed. It boasts the same power as the standard Dynamo Roller! I think the Dynamo Roller's offensive power nicely complements the reliable Splat Bombs and Inkstrike! Combine them all, and your attacks will hit home with unprecedented force! Your foes will flee before you!(NA)\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- An Inkling holding the Gold Dynamo Roller\n\n- Official art of an Inkling boy that ressembles Rider holding the Gold Dynamo Roller.\n\n- Render with the Dynamo Roller\n\n- SplatNet icon\n\nThe Gold Dynamo Roller returns in Splatoon 2 looking identical to how it did in the first game.

Sure, you sacrifice a bit of mobility for a weapon like this, but you can relax knowing you've got Ink Armor to protect yourself. I'd recommend this beauty to anyone who wants to display overwhelming strength!\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- Holding the Gold Dynamo Roller\n\n- Swing with the Gold Dynamo Roller\n\n- Pompompurin holding a Gold Dynamo Roller in art for the My Melody vs. Pompompurin Splatfest\n\n- An Octoling girl holding a Gold Dynamo Roller\n\nThe Gold Dynamo Roller returns in Splatoon 3 in Drizzle Season 2023, featuring an updated design in tandem with the base Dynamo Roller.

It's based on the standard Dynamo Roller and has the same basic capabilities. Yes, with these rollers, I had to sacrifice a bit of mobility to give them best-in-class firepower and range. But I haven't heard any complaints so far! With this loadout, you'll use the Splat Bombs and Super Chump to distract your opponents while you look for an opening. Hit 'em hard, and don't let 'em splat you back! The best defense is a good offense, and offense doesn't get any better than this. So, weirdly, it's also the best defense! I hope you'll give this set a try.\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- An Octoling rolling with the Gold Dynamo Roller\n\n- An Octoling with the Gold Dynamo Roller next to an Inkling performing a Squid Surge\n\n- 3D artwork of an Octoling using the Gold Dynamo Roller\n\n- 3D artwork of an Octoling using the Gold Dynamo Roller (transparent background)\n\n- 3D artwork of an Inkling using the Gold Dynamo Roller\n\n- Gold Dynamo Roller showing up in the back of the physical game box art\n\n- Gold Dynamo Roller showing up in the official browser eShop page of Splatoon 3\n\n- Gold Dynamo Roller in a board displaying an old Tableturf Battle logo.\n\n- An Inkling using a Gold Dynamo Roller in the Splatoon Turf Quiz\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Gold Dynamo Roller.\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Gold_Dynamo_Roller_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nModel of the Gold Dynamo Roller rotating (Link to file)\n\nFor competitive tips about the Gold Dynamo Roller\n\n- The horizontal swing of the Gold Dynamo Roller will fill more of the special gauge than its vertical swing.\n\n- The range of the Gold Dynamo Roller's vertical swing surpasses the range of both the Squiffer and Bamboozler series, the Squiffers by a good deal, and the Bamboozlers by a few frames.\n\n- In Splatoon 3 promotional material, the Gold Dynamo Roller was first present as early as the game's reveal trailer in the February 2021 Nintendo Direct, marking an interval of roughly two and a half years between its initial sighting and its formal reveal leading up to Drizzle Season 2023.\n\n- Across all three games, the Gold Dynamo Roller is unlocked exactly five levels after the Dynamo Roller.\n\nGold Dynamo Roller is derived from Gold, Dynamo and Roller.

Gold refers to the fact that it is a gilded Dynamo Roller, and also used to differentiate the Gold Dynamo Roller from the Dynamo Roller.\n\nダイナモローラーテスラ Dainamo rōrā tesura means Dynamo Roller Tesla.
