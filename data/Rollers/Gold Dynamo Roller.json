    "The Gold Dynamo Roller is a main weapon in the Splatoon series. It is a Dynamo Roller with a different look and a different loadout.",
    "The Gold Dynamo Roller shares its overall design with the Dynamo Roller. However, the Gold Dynamo Roller is entirely gold, except for the tubes and the roller, which change color to match the user's ink. In Splatoon, the gold color is shinier, while in Splatoon 2, the color is duller.",
    "The Gold Dynamo Roller comes with Splat Bombs and the Inkstrike.",
    "Like the Dynamo Roller, the Gold Dynamo Roller can only be purchased after collecting the Sunken Scroll from the Octo Valley mission Enter the Octobot King!.",
    "[1]",
    "The Gold Dynamo Roller is another roller I designed. It boasts the same power as the standard Dynamo Roller! I think the Dynamo Roller's offensive power nicely complements the reliable Splat Bombs and Inkstrike! Combine them all, and your attacks will hit home with unprecedented force! Your foes will flee before you!(NA)",
    "The Gold Dynamo Roller returns in Splatoon 2 looking identical to how it did in the first game. It was released on 28 October 2017 at 02:00 UTC.[2] It comes with Splat Bombs and Ink Armor. In early data mining, it was shown to have Toxic Mist as its sub weapon, but this was changed before release.",
    "[3][4]",
    "The Gold Dynamo Roller is another roller I designed. It boasts the same power as the standard Dynamo Roller. Use the Splat Bombs to flush out your foes, putting them at the mercy of your roller! Sure, you sacrifice a bit of mobility for a weapon like this, but you can relax knowing you've got Ink Armor to protect yourself. I'd recommend this beauty to anyone who wants to display overwhelming strength!",
    "The Gold Dynamo Roller returns in Splatoon 3 in Drizzle Season 2023, featuring an updated design in tandem with the base Dynamo Roller. Its kit contains the Splat Bomb and Super Chump.",
    "[5][6]",
    "The Gold Dynamo Roller is another roller that I'm proud to say I designed myself! It's based on the standard Dynamo Roller and has the same basic capabilities. Yes, with these rollers, I had to sacrifice a bit of mobility to give them best-in-class firepower and range. But I haven't heard any complaints so far! With this loadout, you'll use the Splat Bombs and Super Chump to distract your opponents while you look for an opening. Hit 'em hard, and don't let 'em splat you back! The best defense is a good offense, and offense doesn't get any better than this. So, weirdly, it's also the best defense! I hope you'll give this set a try.",
    "For competitive tips about the Gold Dynamo Roller",
    "Gold Dynamo Roller is derived from Gold, Dynamo and Roller. Dynamo is a type of electrical generator, which the Gold Dynamo Roller seems partly based on. Gold refers to the fact that it is a gilded Dynamo Roller, and also used to differentiate the Gold Dynamo Roller from the Dynamo Roller.",
    "ダイナモローラーテスラ Dainamo rōrā tesura means Dynamo Roller Tesla. Tesla refers to Nikola Tesla, a Serbian American inventor known for his work in electrical engineering. Tesla may also refer to a Tesla coil.",
