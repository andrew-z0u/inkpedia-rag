    "The Foil Flingza Roller is a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3. It is a Foil-branded version of the Flingza Roller, and it comes with a different loadout.",
    "In Splatoon 2, the Foil Flingza Roller is nearly identical in appearance to the Flingza Roller. The only difference between the two is that the Foil Flingza Roller has a sticker bearing the Foil logo on the Swiss Army Knife.",
    "In Splatoon 3, the Foil sticker is still present, but the weapon's color has changed from red to blue.",
    "The Foil Flingza Roller was released on 18 November 2017 at 02:00 UTC.[1] It comes as a set with Suction Bombs and Tenta Missiles.",
    "[2][3]",
    "Here comes the Foil Flingza Roller! It brings the features of the Flingza Roller but adds a slick gear brand logo so you know it's official. The easy-to-use Suction Bombs and Tenta Missiles go great with a unique roller like this that can take some getting used to. Just roll with it!",
    "The Foil Flingza Roller returned in Splatoon 3 as part of the Fresh Season 2024 update. The weapon now sports a blue color instead of the previous red. Its set contains Suction Bombs and the Splattercolor Screen.",
    "[5][6]",
    "Here comes the Foil Flingza Roller! It brings the features of the Flingza Roller but adds a slick brand logo so you know it's official. Flush out foes with the Suction Bomb sub, then put the vertical swing's long range to use finishing them off. If they run toward you, use the horizontal swing for a quick splat! Or! Wait for the Splattercolor Screen to do its work, and THEN toss out a Suction Bomb in the confusion. They'll get taken out before they even realize which team threw it! This weapon offers a lot of game plans, from the range and coverage of the vertical swing to the quick and decisive horizontal swings. Find the method that works for you!",
