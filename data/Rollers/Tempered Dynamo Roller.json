Dynamo is a type of electrical generator, which the Tempered Dynamo Roller seems partly based on. Tempered refers to tempering, a process in metallurgy that is used to increase the toughness of iron-based alloys, explaining the hue of the metal.\n\nダイナモローラーバーンド Dainamo Rōrā Bāndo means Dynamo Roller Burned. Burned refers to the fact that it is a Dynamo Roller that has been burnt to be tempered."
