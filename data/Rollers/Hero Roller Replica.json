    "The Hero Roller Replica is a main weapon in Splatoon and Splatoon 2. It is the hero-themed variant of the Splat Roller, designed to look like the Hero Roller used by agents to fight Octarians.",
    "In both games, the Hero Roller Replica is designed to look identical to the Hero Roller. In Splatoon, the Hero Roller Replica is mainly black with blue lights. Despite functioning identically to the Splat Roller, the Hero Roller Replica has a visual design that is more like the Carbon Roller. In Splatoon 2, the Hero Roller Replica looks identical to the Level 1 Hero Roller, and is mainly yellow with a black ink tank that has blue lights on it. It again looks reminiscent of the Carbon Roller despite functioning like the Splat Roller.",
    "The Hero Roller Replica is a replica of the Hero Roller used in the Inkling Boy amiibo challenges. Just like the Hero Shot Replica is to the Splattershot, the Hero Roller is identical to the Splat Roller, with the same stats and loadout of Suction Bombs and Killer Wail.",
    "To unlock the Hero Roller Replica, the player must play the last set of missions from the Inkling Boy amiibo:",
    "The blueprints to the Hero Roller Replica are received after completing the fifth boss challenge.",
    "[1]",
    "Though it pains me to admit it, I was simply unable to reproduce the technology used in these blueprints... But I did manage to remodel a standard Splat Roller so that it LOOKS like the roller in the pictures! Cool, eh?",
    "The Hero Roller Replica returns to Splatoon 2 with an updated model that is visually identical to the Level 1 Hero Roller. However it is once again a re-skinned Splat Roller, which therefore now comes with Curling Bombs and Splashdown. To unlock the Hero Roller Replica, the player must now complete every level with the Hero Roller in Octo Canyon.",
    "[2][3]",
    "The Hero Roller Replica is a specially designed roller with the same stats as the standard Splat Roller. This weapon came about after I made a breakthrough in my research and managed to create the ultimate weapon! Sadly, it never made it to mass production because the guys at the factory couldn't wrap their heads around my advanced schematics... So instead they just slapped some shiny parts on a standard roller and called it the Hero Roller Replica. Give it a shot sometime!",
