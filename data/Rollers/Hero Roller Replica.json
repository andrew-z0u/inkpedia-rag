    "The Hero Roller Replica is a main weapon in Splatoon and Splatoon 2. It is the hero-themed variant of the Splat Roller, designed to look like the Hero Roller used by agents to fight Octarians.",
    "In both games, the Hero Roller Replica is designed to look identical to the Hero Roller. In Splatoon, the Hero Roller Replica is mainly black with blue lights. Despite functioning identically to the Splat Roller, the Hero Roller Replica has a visual design that is more like the Carbon Roller. In Splatoon 2, the Hero Roller Replica looks identical to the Level 1 Hero Roller, and is mainly yellow with a black ink tank that has blue lights on it. It again looks reminiscent of the Carbon Roller despite functioning like the Splat Roller.",
    "The Hero Roller Replica is a replica of the Hero Roller used in the Inkling Boy amiibo challenges. Just like the Hero Shot Replica is to the Splattershot, the Hero Roller is identical to the Splat Roller, with the same stats and loadout of Suction Bombs and Killer Wail.",
    "To unlock the Hero Roller Replica, the player must play the last set of missions from the Inkling Boy amiibo:",

    "The Hero Roller Replica returns to Splatoon 2 with an updated model that is visually identical to the Level 1 Hero Roller. However it is once again a re-skinned Splat Roller, which therefore now comes with Curling Bombs and Splashdown. To unlock the Hero Roller Replica, the player must now complete every level with the Hero Roller in Octo Canyon.",

    "- Callie's main weapon is shown to be the Hero Roller as it appears in Splatoon or its replica, likely from her time in the role of Agent 1. This is shown in her artwork for the Show No Mercy! vs. Focus on Healing Splatfest, as well as in the Splatoon manga series.",
    "- The Hero Roller's design in Splatoon 2 closely resembles the design of the Carbon Roller despite the weapon sharing identical stats to the Splat Roller."
