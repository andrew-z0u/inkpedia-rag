In Splatoon, the Hero Roller Replica is mainly black with blue lights. Despite functioning identically to the Splat Roller, the Hero Roller Replica has a visual design that is more like the Carbon Roller. In Splatoon 2, the Hero Roller Replica looks identical to the Level 1 Hero Roller, and is mainly yellow with a black ink tank that has blue lights on it. It again looks reminiscent of the Carbon Roller despite functioning like the Splat Roller.\n\nThe Hero Roller Replica is a replica of the Hero Roller used in the Inkling Boy amiibo challenges. Just like the Hero Shot Replica is to the Splattershot, the Hero Roller is identical to the Splat Roller, with the same stats and loadout of Suction Bombs and Killer Wail.\n\nTo unlock the Hero Roller Replica, the player must play the last set of missions from the Inkling Boy amiibo:\n\n- 22. Splat-Switch Revolution\n\n- 24. Pinwheel Power Plant\n\n- 26.

But I did manage to remodel a standard Splat Roller so that it LOOKS like the roller in the pictures!

This weapon came about after I made a breakthrough in my research and managed to create the ultimate weapon! Sadly, it never made it to mass production because the guys at the factory couldn't wrap their heads around my advanced schematics... So instead they just slapped some shiny parts on a standard roller and called it the Hero Roller Replica. Give it a shot sometime!\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- Hero weapons, with the Hero Roller Replica in the top-left\n\n- A Splashtag banner in Splatoon 3 with the Hero Roller Replica on the far-right\n\nFor competitive tips about the Hero Roller Replica\n\nNote: the strategy advice for Splat Roller also applies to Hero Roller Replica, so they share the same strategy page.\n\n- Callie's main weapon is shown to be the Hero Roller as it appears in Splatoon or its replica, likely from her time in the role of Agent 1. This is shown in her artwork for the Show No Mercy! vs. Focus on Healing Splatfest, as well as in the Splatoon manga series.\n\n- The Hero Roller's design in Splatoon 2 closely resembles the design of the Carbon Roller despite the weapon sharing identical stats to the Splat Roller."
