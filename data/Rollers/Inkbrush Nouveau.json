    "The Inkbrush Nouveau is a main weapon in the Splatoon series. It is the Nouveau-branded version of the Inkbrush.",
    "The Inkbrush Nouveau is nearly identical in appearance to the Inkbrush. The only difference between the two is that the Inkbrush Nouveau has a sticker bearing the Nouveau logo on the metal part. In Splatoon 3, the Inkbrush Nouveau has a slightly updated appearance, now having lighter-toned bristles and a brass ferrule.",
    "The Inkbrush Nouveau was released on 1 August 2015 at 02:00 UTC.[1][2] The Inkbrush Nouveau is a variation of the Inkbrush, maintaining the same stats, but instead comes with Ink Mines and the Bubbler.",
    "[3]",
    "The Inkbrush Nouveau has the same abilities as the Inkbrush, but it comes with quite a different setup!\nYou can use the brush to swiftly lay Ink Mines. Your opponents won't know what hit 'em.\nAnd since you can share the Bubbler with your allies, this is a great set if you like to support your team!(NA)",
    "The Inkbrush Nouveau was released on 11 November 2017 at 02:00 UTC.[4] It comes with Ink Mines and the Baller.",
    "[5][6]",
    "Ah, now, the Inkbrush Nouveau here offers the same stats as the Inkbrush but offers quite a different experience! Leave Ink Mines for unsuspecting opponents and then rush them while they're reeling from the inky blast! Use the Baller for protection, allowing you to go places the standard Inkbrush set would never allow! This set is great for those who want to take their Inkbrush technique to the next level.",
    "The Inkbrush Nouveau returns in Splatoon 3. Its design is similar to the Inkbrush, but its bristles are lighter, the and the metal part on the paint tube is now brass instead of silver. Its kit contains Ink Mines and the Ultra Stamp. It debuted in Chill Season 2022.",
    "[7][8]",
    "If you like the Inkbrush but you're not thrilled with its base loadout, why not try something new? By that I mean the Inkbrush Nouveau! You can use that patented Inkbrush mobility to glide across the terrain, leaving Ink Mines in all sorts of INK-onvenient places for the other team as you go. Find yourself in a tight spot? Blast your way out with the Ultra Stamp! Then you can continue inking up enemy territory like a postmodern painter gone wild. This is the perfect set for battle artists who can't stand to stand still!",
