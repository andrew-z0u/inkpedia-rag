The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- Ink consumption per second while rolling scales from 0.6% to 3% depending on the rolling speed.\n\n- While rolling, the player's movement speed is set to 0.118 units per frame.\n\n- After rolling for 0.5 seconds, the player begins to dash.\n\n- When dashing, the player's movement speed is set to 0.142 units per frame.\n\n- After rolling, there is a 20 frame second cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Hitting an opponent while rolling deals 70 damage.\n\n- While rolling, the Planetz Big Swig Roller leaves an ink trail that is 6.8 units wide.\n\n- The ink consumption of 9% allows players to attack 11 times before needing to refill the ink supply.\n\n- When attacking with a nearly depleted ink tank, the ink consumption of that attack is reduced to 4.5%. The damage of that attack is reduced to 25% of the normal amount, and the speed in which the globs of ink move is reduced to 50% of the normal amount, effectively reducing its range.\n\n- When attacking, it takes 18 frames to lift the roller (0.3 seconds).\n\n- When attacking while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.072 units per frame.\n\n- After swinging, there is a 45 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Attacks have a base damage of 70.\n\n- For normal attacks, ink loses damage based on distance traveled. Ink starts losing damage at 4.2 units and stops losing damage at 8.2 units. The minimum damage before time-based falloff is applied is 40.\n\n- If a glob of ink is in the air for more than 30 frames after being flung, it loses damage each frame until frame 55, at which point it will deal 50% of its original damage. Thus, the minimum damage that can be dealt per glob is is 20.\n\n- Ink flung from the center of the roller does the greatest damage. Ink that is flung at an angle greater than 12.0 degrees to the left or right will have lower damage. This low-damage ink starts losing damage after traveling a distance of 2.0 units and stops losing damage at 7.7 units. The maximum damage is 70 and the minimum damage is 40.\n\n- The ink consumption of 9% allows players to attack 11 times before needing to refill the ink supply.\n\n- When attacking with a nearly depleted ink tank, the ink consumption of that attack is reduced to 4.5%. The damage of that attack is reduced to 50% of the normal amount, and the speed in which the globs of ink move is reduced to 70% of the normal amount, effectively reducing its range.\n\n- When attacking, it takes 20 frames to lift the roller (0.33 seconds).\n\n- When attacking while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.072 units per frame.\n\n- After swinging, there is a 50 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Attacks have a base damage of 120.\n\n- For normal attacks, ink loses damage based on distance traveled. Ink starts losing damage at 5.2 units and stops losing damage at 16.0 units. The minimum damage before time-based falloff is applied is 40.\n\n- The lethal range is 7.7 units, as this is the farthest distance where ink deals 100 damage.\n\n- If a glob of ink is in the air for more than 40 frames after being flung, it loses damage each frame until frame 65, at which point it will deal 50% of its original damage. Thus, the minimum damage that can be dealt per glob is is 20.\n\n- Damage does not change based on the angle of the ink.\n\n[1][2]\n\nIf you're gonna make a glittery, eye-catching roller, you might as well make it as wide as possible, right? That's what Emberz was thinking with the Planetz Big Swig Roller! Packaged with the Torpedo sub, you can really give the turf a good inking. And the Triple Splashdown special always leaves a mark too. Ink, attack repeat! Say it again! Ink, attack, repeat! If you can get behind that mantra, you'll get far with this set.\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- Promotional image of the Emberz collection\n\nThe word planetz is a stylized spelling of the word planets."
