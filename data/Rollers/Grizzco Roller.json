It can perform a quick horizontal swing that deals similar damage to the base Dynamo Roller, and a very slow but highly powerful vertical swing.\n\nThe Grizzco Roller has a similar design to the Dynamo Roller, although heavily modified. The paint roller portion has been replaced with one featuring an hexagonal pattern, though missing the cap holding the broken bar on the front. On the side the weapon features a hastily attached engine closely behind the roller's axis, with the piston heads of said engine being replaced with components resembling yellow pill bottles with white lids. Next to the engine, a motorbike's exhaust pipe is attached and held in place with duct tape, partially hiding the Grizzco logo underneath. Lastly, there is a hose connecting the engine and new roller portion to the main tank in the middle of the weapon's shaft.\n\nThe Grizzco Roller is one of the rare weapons in Salmon Run Next Wave. It was made available for the first time at 8 June 2024 at  00:00 UTC.\n\n- The Grizzco Roller is a heavyweight weapon.\n\n- Ink consumption per second while rolling scales from 1.2% to 6% depending on the rolling speed.\n\n- While rolling, the player's movement speed is set to 0.128 units per frame.\n\n- After rolling for 0.27 seconds, the player begins to dash.\n\n- When dashing, the player's movement speed is set to 0.3 units per frame.\n\n- Hitting an opponent while rolling deals 400 damage.\n\n- While rolling, the Grizzco Roller leaves an ink trail that is 5.6 units wide.\n\n- The ink consumption of 5% allows players to attack 20 times before needing to refill the ink supply.\n\n- When attacking, it takes 12 frames to lift the roller (0.2 seconds).\n\n- When attacking while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.036 units per frame.\n\n- After swinging, there is a 40 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Attacks have a base damage of 150.\n\n- For normal attacks, ink loses damage based on distance traveled. Ink starts losing damage at 3.5 units and stops losing damage at 5.2 units. The minimum damage before time-based falloff is applied is 50.\n\n- The lethal range is 4.6 units, as this is the farthest distance where ink deals 100 damage.\n\n- If a glob of ink is in the air for more than 25 frames after being flung, it loses damage each frame until frame 45, at which point it will deal 50% of its original damage. Thus, the minimum damage that can be dealt per glob is is 25.\n\n- Ink flung from the center of the roller does the greatest damage. Ink that is flung at an angle greater than 14.5 degrees to the left or right will have lower damage. This low-damage ink starts losing damage after traveling a distance of 3.0 units and stops losing damage at 5.0 units. The maximum damage is 150 and the minimum damage is 50.\n\n- The ink consumption of 20% allows players to attack 5 times before needing to refill the ink supply.\n\n- When attacking, it takes 72 frames to lift the roller (1.2 seconds).\n\n- When attacking while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.016 units per frame.\n\n- After swinging, there is a 75 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Attacks have a base damage of 600.\n\n- For normal attacks, ink loses damage based on distance traveled. Ink starts losing damage at 8.2 units and stops losing damage at 18.5 units. The minimum damage before time-based falloff is applied is 400.\n\n- If a glob of ink is in the air for more than 30 frames after being flung, it loses damage each frame until frame 45, at which point it will deal 50% of its original damage. Thus, the minimum damage that can be dealt per glob is is 200.\n\n- Ink flung from the center of the roller does the greatest damage. Ink that is flung at an angle greater than 5.0 degrees to the left or right will have lower damage. This low-damage ink starts losing damage after traveling a distance of 4.2 units and stops losing damage at 14.2 units. The maximum damage is 600 and the minimum damage is 400.\n\nIn Splatoon 3, the Grizzco Roller was available during the following wildcard rotations:\n\n- Promotional teaser\n\n- Grizzco Roller 2D icon\n\n- Held by a player\n\n- Held down by a player\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:SRNW_Grizzco_Roller_demo.mp4\n\n\nA demonstration of the Grizzco Roller.
