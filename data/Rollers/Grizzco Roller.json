    "The Grizzco Roller is a Salmon Run Next Wave rare weapon in Splatoon 3. It appears to be an illegitimately modified[1] Dynamo Roller.",
    "The Grizzco Roller is equipped with a motor engine, providing an extremely fast roll, faster than even the Inkbrush, that deals heavy damage to any Salmonid it touches. It can perform a quick horizontal swing that deals similar damage to the base Dynamo Roller, and a very slow but highly powerful vertical swing.",
    "The Grizzco Roller has a similar design to the Dynamo Roller, although heavily modified. The paint roller portion has been replaced with one featuring an hexagonal pattern, though missing the cap holding the broken bar on the front. On the side the weapon features a hastily attached engine closely behind the roller's axis, with the piston heads of said engine being replaced with components resembling yellow pill bottles with white lids. Next to the engine, a motorbike's exhaust pipe is attached and held in place with duct tape, partially hiding the Grizzco logo underneath. Lastly, there is a hose connecting the engine and new roller portion to the main tank in the middle of the weapon's shaft.",
    "The Grizzco Roller is one of the rare weapons in Salmon Run Next Wave. It was made available for the first time at 8 June 2024 at  00:00 UTC.",
    "In Splatoon 3, the Grizzco Roller was available during the following wildcard rotations:",
