The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- Ink consumption per second while rolling scales from 1.2% to 6% depending on the rolling speed.\n\n- While rolling, the player's movement speed is set to 0.128 units per frame.\n\n- After rolling for 0.33 seconds, the player begins to dash.\n\n- When dashing, the player's movement speed is set to 0.152 units per frame.\n\n- After rolling, there is a 20 frame second cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Hitting an opponent while rolling deals 70 damage.\n\n- While rolling, the Carbon Roller ANG-L leaves an ink trail that is 4.4 units wide.\n\n- The ink consumption of 3.96% allows players to attack 25 times before needing to refill the ink supply.\n\n- When attacking with a nearly depleted ink tank, the ink consumption of that attack is reduced to 1.98%. The damage of that attack is reduced to 25% of the normal amount, and the speed in which the globs of ink move is reduced to 50% of the normal amount, effectively reducing its range.\n\n- When attacking, it takes 10 frames to lift the roller (0.17 seconds).\n\n- When attacking while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.06 units per frame.\n\n- After swinging, there is a 40 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Attacks have a base damage of 100.\n\n- For normal attacks, ink loses damage based on distance traveled. Ink starts losing damage at 4.7 units and stops losing damage at 8.7 units. The minimum damage before time-based falloff is applied is 25.\n\n- The lethal range is 4.7 units, as this is the farthest distance where ink deals 100 damage.\n\n- If a glob of ink is in the air for more than 24 frames after being flung, it loses damage each frame until frame 44, at which point it will deal 50% of its original damage. Thus, the minimum damage that can be dealt per glob is is 12.5.\n\n- Ink flung from the center of the roller does the greatest damage. Ink that is flung at an angle greater than 16.0 degrees to the left or right will have lower damage. This low-damage ink starts losing damage after traveling a distance of 3.2 units and stops losing damage at 7.2 units. The maximum damage is 100 and the minimum damage is 25.\n\n- The ink consumption of 3.96% allows players to attack 25 times before needing to refill the ink supply.\n\n- When attacking with a nearly depleted ink tank, the ink consumption of that attack is reduced to 1.98%. The damage of that attack is reduced to 50% of the normal amount, and the speed in which the globs of ink move is reduced to 70% of the normal amount, effectively reducing its range.\n\n- When attacking, it takes 12 frames to lift the roller (0.2 seconds).\n\n- When attacking while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.048 units per frame.\n\n- After swinging, there is a 45 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Attacks have a base damage of 120.\n\n- For normal attacks, ink loses damage based on distance traveled. Ink starts losing damage at 4.2 units and stops losing damage at 14.2 units. The minimum damage before time-based falloff is applied is 35.\n\n- If a glob of ink is in the air for more than 30 frames after being flung, it loses damage each frame until frame 45, at which point it will deal 50% of its original damage. Thus, the minimum damage that can be dealt per glob is is 17.5.\n\n- Damage does not change based on the angle of the ink.\n\n[1][2]\n\n- ▲ Points to fill special gauge: 180 → 170.\n\nInspired by the deep-sea anglerfish, the Carbon Roller ANG-L was developed by Barazushi for use in all environments—perhaps even the bottom of the ocean! Throw in a Fizzy Bomb sub for extra mobility—which was not lacking, by the way–and this set can help you pounce on an opening as soon as it appears. That means when you catch opponents with the Super Chump special, they'll be sitting ducks. I hope you'll snap this set up and give it a try!\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- Promotional image of the Splatlands Collection - Barazushi weapons\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Carbon_Roller_ANG-L_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nPromotional video (link to file)\n\nThe brand stylization suffix \"ANG-L\" is derived from anglerfish."
