    "The Dynamo Roller is a main weapon in Splatoon 3. It is an Emberz-branded version of the Dynamo Roller.",
    "The Starz Dynamo Roller has the same shape as the Dynamo Roller. However, the usual silver color has been replaced by a shiny midnight blue, with whitish streaks reminiscent of stars visible on a starry night, hence the weapon's name. The main handle and certain parts, notably the cone separating the roller from the handle, are white. Two steel rods just above the handle feature the colors of the Emberz brand: neon red, neon green, and neon blue. There are also three bulbs attached to the steel rod running along the roller section, again in the brand's colors. Finally, the Emberz signature is visible on one side of the weapon.",
    "The Starz Dynamo Roller appears in Splatoon 3 on 12 June 2025, as part of the Splatlands Collection. Its kit is Point Sensor and Killer Wail 5.1.",
