However, the usual silver color has been replaced by a shiny midnight blue, with whitish streaks reminiscent of stars visible on a starry night, hence the weapon's name. The main handle and certain parts, notably the cone separating the roller from the handle, are white. Two steel rods just above the handle feature the colors of the Emberz brand: neon red, neon green, and neon blue. There are also three bulbs attached to the steel rod running along the roller section, again in the brand's colors. Finally, the Emberz signature is visible on one side of the weapon.\n\nThe Starz Dynamo Roller appears in Splatoon 3 on 12 June 2025, as part of the Splatlands Collection. Its kit is Point Sensor and Killer Wail 5.1.\n\n- The Starz Dynamo Roller is a heavyweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 18.5. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- Ink consumption per second while rolling scales from 1.2% to 6% depending on the rolling speed.\n\n- While rolling, the player's movement speed is set to 0.088 units per frame.\n\n- After rolling for 1.5 seconds, the player begins to dash.\n\n- When dashing, the player's movement speed is set to 0.108 units per frame.\n\n- After rolling, there is a 20 frame second cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Hitting an opponent while rolling deals 125 damage.\n\n- While rolling, the Starz Dynamo Roller leaves an ink trail that is 6.8 units wide.\n\n- The ink consumption of 18% allows players to attack 5 times before needing to refill the ink supply.\n\n- When attacking with a nearly depleted ink tank, the ink consumption of that attack is reduced to 9%. The damage of that attack is reduced to 25% of the normal amount, and the speed in which the globs of ink move is reduced to 50% of the normal amount, effectively reducing its range.\n\n- When attacking, it takes 45 frames to lift the roller (0.75 seconds).\n\n- When attacking while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.024 units per frame.\n\n- After swinging, there is a 55 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Attacks have a base damage of 180.\n\n- For normal attacks, ink loses damage based on distance traveled. Ink starts losing damage at 7.2 units and stops losing damage at 17.4 units. The minimum damage before time-based falloff is applied is 40.\n\n- The lethal range is 10.77 units, as this is the farthest distance where ink deals 100 damage.\n\n- If a glob of ink is in the air for more than 30 frames after being flung, it loses damage each frame until frame 55, at which point it will deal 50% of its original damage. Thus, the minimum damage that can be dealt per glob is is 20.\n\n- Ink flung from the center of the roller does the greatest damage. Ink that is flung at an angle greater than 14.5 degrees to the left or right will have lower damage. This low-damage ink starts losing damage after traveling a distance of 0.2 units and stops losing damage at 12.2 units. The maximum damage is 120 and the minimum damage is 40.\n\n- The ink consumption of 18% allows players to attack 5 times before needing to refill the ink supply.\n\n- When attacking with a nearly depleted ink tank, the ink consumption of that attack is reduced to 9%. The damage of that attack is reduced to 50% of the normal amount, and the speed in which the globs of ink move is reduced to 70% of the normal amount, effectively reducing its range.\n\n- When attacking, it takes 55 frames to lift the roller (0.92 seconds).\n\n- When attacking while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.024 units per frame.\n\n- After swinging, there is a 70 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Attacks have a base damage of 180.\n\n- For normal attacks, ink loses damage based on distance traveled. Ink starts losing damage at 8.2 units and stops losing damage at 20.6 units. The minimum damage before time-based falloff is applied is 40.\n\n- The lethal range is 12.87 units, as this is the farthest distance where ink deals 100 damage.\n\n- If a glob of ink is in the air for more than 40 frames after being flung, it loses damage each frame until frame 65, at which point it will deal 50% of its original damage. Thus, the minimum damage that can be dealt per glob is is 20.\n\n- Damage does not change based on the angle of the ink.\n\n[1][2]\n\nWhat happens when you take a Sheldon design and collaborate with a brand like Emberz? You get the Starz Dynamo Roller, a snazzy new take on my original design. Don't worry - this roller can still spill ink with the best of them. But now with the Point Sensor and Killer Wail 5.1, you can nail down those enemy locations and rain ink with your main! This set has no real weaknesses. Use it well, and it's almost like having night vision! I hope you'll give it a try.\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Starz_Dynamo_Roller_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nModel of the Starz Dynamo Roller rotating (Link to file)\n\nThe word starz is a stylized spelling of the word stars.
