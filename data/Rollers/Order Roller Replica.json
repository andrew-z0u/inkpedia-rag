The Order Roller Replica's stats, sub weapon, and special weapon are identical to those of the Splat Roller.\n\nTo unlock the Order Roller Replica, the player must complete Side Order with Callie's Palette.\n\n- The Order Roller Replica is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 11.8. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- Ink consumption per second while rolling scales from 1.2% to 6% depending on the rolling speed.\n\n- While rolling, the player's movement speed is set to 0.108 units per frame.\n\n- After rolling for 1.5 seconds, the player begins to dash.\n\n- When dashing, the player's movement speed is set to 0.132 units per frame.\n\n- After rolling, there is a 20 frame second cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Hitting an opponent while rolling deals 125 damage.\n\n- While rolling, the Order Roller Replica leaves an ink trail that is 5.6 units wide.\n\n- The ink consumption of 8.5% allows players to attack 11 times before needing to refill the ink supply.\n\n- When attacking, it takes 21 frames to lift the roller (0.35 seconds).\n\n- When attacking while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.048 units per frame.\n\n- After swinging, there is a 45 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Attacks have a base damage of 150.\n\n- For normal attacks, ink loses damage based on distance traveled. Ink starts losing damage at 4.2 units and stops losing damage at 10.7 units. The minimum damage before time-based falloff is applied is 35.\n\n- The lethal range is 7.2 units, as this is the farthest distance where ink deals 100 damage.\n\n- If a glob of ink is in the air for more than 25 frames after being flung, it loses damage each frame until frame 45, at which point it will deal 50% of its original damage. Thus, the minimum damage that can be dealt per glob is is 17.5.\n\n- Ink flung from the center of the roller does the greatest damage. Ink that is flung at an angle greater than 16.0 degrees to the left or right will have lower damage. This low-damage ink starts losing damage after traveling a distance of 2.0 units and stops losing damage at 9.2 units. The maximum damage is 100 and the minimum damage is 35.\n\n- The ink consumption of 8.5% allows players to attack 11 times before needing to refill the ink supply.\n\n- When attacking, it takes 26 frames to lift the roller (0.43 seconds).\n\n- When attacking while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.048 units per frame.\n\n- After swinging, there is a 60 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Attacks have a base damage of 150.\n\n- For normal attacks, ink loses damage based on distance traveled. Ink starts losing damage at 5.2 units and stops losing damage at 13.2 units. The minimum damage before time-based falloff is applied is 40.\n\n- The lethal range is 8.2 units, as this is the farthest distance where ink deals 100 damage.\n\n- If a glob of ink is in the air for more than 30 frames after being flung, it loses damage each frame until frame 45, at which point it will deal 50% of its original damage. Thus, the minimum damage that can be dealt per glob is is 20.\n\n- Damage does not change based on the angle of the ink.\n\n[1][2]\n\n- ▲ Damage dealt by horizontal swings and vertical swings to Splash Wall increased by about 10%: 2.4x → 2.64x.\n\n- 2D icon\n\nFor competitive tips about the Order Roller Replica\n\nNote: The strategy advice for Splat Roller also applies to Order Roller Replica, because of this, they share the same strategy page."
