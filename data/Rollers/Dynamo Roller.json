    "The Dynamo Roller is a main weapon in the Splatoon series, manufactured by Ammo Knights. It is a heavyweight roller with increased power and range, at the cost of slowness and high ink consumption.",
    "The Dynamo Roller can cover turf while in motion and can fling a large amount of ink at medium range. Compared to the Splat Roller, this roller is much slower but covers a larger area while rolling and throwing ink. It has the greatest range of all the roller class weapons, but sacrifices speed; it rolls slowly when pushed, and it takes over a second to fling ink. The slow ink-flinging windup animation leaves the player vulnerable when attacking, as no other actions may be performed while preparing the fling, and it is not possible to cancel a fling once initiated. The Dynamo Roller's mobility is low, so speed is impaired when it is equipped, even when not attacking with the weapon.",
    "The Dynamo Roller has a metal handle that is a light bronze color in Splatoon or duller bronze in Splatoon 2 and black. The middle of the handle is shaped a bit like a vase and has two short, straight tubes running in front of and behind it. These tubes change color to match the user's ink. The roller part, like all rollers', changes color to match the user's ink. When out of ink, it displays a polka dot pattern. On both sides of the roller are silver-colored metal attachments that connect to each other via a bronze-colored stick of metal. The left attachment connects the roller to the handle.",
    "The Dynamo Roller comes with Sprinkler and Echolocator. It can only be purchased after collecting the Sunken Scroll from the Octo Valley mission Enter the Octobot King!, and after reaching level fifteen.",
    "[1]",
    "The Dynamo Roller is a roller I designed myself upon using my granddad's blueprints! It wound up with incredible power, but the dynamo motor does weigh it down a bit... oh, well. Anyway, ink turf with the Sprinkler and track enemies with the Echolocator, and you'll be winning in no time!(NA)",
    "The Dynamo Roller returns in Splatoon 2, with minor appearance changes but significant performance changes. It comes with Ink Mines and Sting Ray. Jumping before flinging ink performs a long-ranged vertical swing. The vertical swing paints a long path of ink and damages distant opponents. If it hits, the vertical fling can splat a Steelhead in only one shot.",
    "It appears in two Octo Expansion stations:",
    "[2][3]",
    "The Dynamo Roller is a roller I designed myself using a power generator for high strength and long range! The motor does weigh it down a smidge, but the Ink Mines wait until someone gets too close before splashing ink everywhere! And the Sting Ray can take down enemies from a comfortable distance! The set appeals to those too stubborn to give up inked turf.",
    "The Dynamo Roller returns in Splatoon 3 with a new design and has Sprinklers and Tacticooler as its kit.",
    "It appears in two missions in Return of the Mammalians:",
    "[4][5]",
    "The Dynamo Roller is a roller I designed myself using a power generator for high strength and long range! Now, I wasn't able to reduce the weight on the motor as much as I would have liked, but this thing can REALLY spill some ink, if I do say so myself. Pair it with the Sprinkler sub, and you can push forward to apply max pressure to the other team. And what will your team be doing, you ask? Why, relaxing and enjoying sweet, sugary sips from your Tacticooler, of course. You'll be the most popular teammate around!",
    "For competitive tips about the Dynamo Roller",
    "Dynamo Roller is derived from Dynamo and Roller. Dynamo is a type of electrical generator, which the Dynamo Roller seems partly based on.",
