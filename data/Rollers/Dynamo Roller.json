    "The Dynamo Roller is a main weapon in the Splatoon series, manufactured by Ammo Knights. It is a heavyweight roller with increased power and range, at the cost of slowness and high ink consumption.",
    "The Dynamo Roller can cover turf while in motion and can fling a large amount of ink at medium range. Compared to the Splat Roller, this roller is much slower but covers a larger area while rolling and throwing ink. It has the greatest range of all the roller class weapons, but sacrifices speed; it rolls slowly when pushed, and it takes over a second to fling ink. The slow ink-flinging windup animation leaves the player vulnerable when attacking, as no other actions may be performed while preparing the fling, and it is not possible to cancel a fling once initiated. The Dynamo Roller's mobility is low, so speed is impaired when it is equipped, even when not attacking with the weapon.",
    "The Dynamo Roller has a metal handle that is a light bronze color in Splatoon or duller bronze in Splatoon 2 and black. The middle of the handle is shaped a bit like a vase and has two short, straight tubes running in front of and behind it. These tubes change color to match the user's ink. The roller part, like all rollers', changes color to match the user's ink. When out of ink, it displays a polka dot pattern. On both sides of the roller are silver-colored metal attachments that connect to each other via a bronze-colored stick of metal. The left attachment connects the roller to the handle.",
    "The Dynamo Roller comes with Sprinkler and Echolocator. It can only be purchased after collecting the Sunken Scroll from the Octo Valley mission Enter the Octobot King!, and after reaching level fifteen.",

    "The Dynamo Roller returns in Splatoon 2, with minor appearance changes but significant performance changes. It comes with Ink Mines and Sting Ray. Jumping before flinging ink performs a long-ranged vertical swing. The vertical swing paints a long path of ink and damages distant opponents. If it hits, the vertical fling can splat a Steelhead in only one shot.",

    "- Against Salmonids, the Dynamo Roller has the highest DPS (Damage Per Second) at 3000 when rolling.",
    "- The horizontal swing of the Dynamo Roller will fill more of the special gauge than its vertical swing.",
    "- The range of the Dynamo Roller's vertical swing surpasses the range of both the Squiffer and Bamboozler series, the Squiffers by a good deal, and the Bamboozlers by a few units.",
    "- The Dynamo Roller was one of the weapons that was available to use in the Splatoon 3 Splatfest World Premiere.",
    "- In Splatoon 3, the Dynamo Roller no longer has a unique roller cover when out of ink, instead reusing the one from the Splat Roller.",
    "Dynamo Roller is derived from Dynamo and Roller. Dynamo is a type of electrical generator, which the Dynamo Roller seems partly based on."
