Compared to the Splat Roller, this roller is much slower but covers a larger area while rolling and throwing ink. It has the greatest range of all the roller class weapons, but sacrifices speed; it rolls slowly when pushed, and it takes over a second to fling ink. The slow ink-flinging windup animation leaves the player vulnerable when attacking, as no other actions may be performed while preparing the fling, and it is not possible to cancel a fling once initiated. The Dynamo Roller's mobility is low, so speed is impaired when it is equipped, even when not attacking with the weapon.\n\nThe Dynamo Roller has a metal handle that is a light bronze color in Splatoon or duller bronze in Splatoon 2 and black. The middle of the handle is shaped a bit like a vase and has two short, straight tubes running in front of and behind it. These tubes change color to match the user's ink. The roller part, like all rollers', changes color to match the user's ink. When out of ink, it displays a polka dot pattern. On both sides of the roller are silver-colored metal attachments that connect to each other via a bronze-colored stick of metal. The left attachment connects the roller to the handle.\n\nThe Dynamo Roller comes with Sprinkler and Echolocator. It can only be purchased after collecting the Sunken Scroll from the Octo Valley mission Enter the Octobot King!, and after reaching level fifteen.\n\n- The Dynamo Roller is a heavyweight weapon.\n\n- Ink consumption while rolling is 6% per second.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- Ink consumption per attack is 20%.\nThis allows players to attack 5 times before needing to refill the ink supply.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This allows players to attack 5 times before needing to refill the ink supply.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- The weapon can attack with a depleted ink tank, but the damage of that attack is reduced to 40% of the normal amount.\n\n- Rolling with a depleted ink tank will not leave a trail or damage opponents.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This allows players to attack 5 times before needing to refill the ink supply.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- When attacking, it takes 45 frames to lift the roller (0.75 seconds).\n\n- When rolling, the player's movement speed is set to 0.96 units per frame.\n\n- When rolling on an uninkable surface or with a depleted ink tank, the player's movement speed is set to 0.96 units per frame.\n\n- After rolling, there is a 0.33 second cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- After swinging, there is a 1.33 second cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Hitting an opponent while rolling deals 160 damage.\n\n- Attacks have a base damage of 125.\n\n- For normal attacks, ink loses damage based on distance traveled. Ink starts losing damage at 110 units and stops losing damage at 170 units. The minimum damage is 25.\n\n- Ink globs travel straight for 6 frames.\n\n- Ink flung from the center of the roller does the greatest damage. Ink that flies to the left or right will have lower damage. This low-damage ink starts losing damage after traveling a distance of 155 units and stops losing damage at 170 units. The maximum damage is 50 and the minimum damage is 25.\n\n- When rolling, the Dynamo Roller leaves an ink trail that is 60 units wide.\n\n[1]\n\n- ▼ Amount of time needed before the ink begins filling after swinging the roller increased.\n\n- ▼ Players can only splat their opponents in one hit if they hit with the center of the roller.\n\n- ▼ Opponents cannot be splatted in one hit when the player is out of ink.\n\n- — Calculation method for damage when the roller is repeatedly swung modified.\n\n- ▼ Special gauge loss: 50% → 75%.\n\n- ▼ Swim speed decreased by about 10%.\n\n- ▼ When using the ink fling attack, decreased the central zone in which it was possible to splat an opponent with a single attack by 18%.\n\n- ▲ Increased damage dealt when flinging ink to attack the barrier around the Rainmaker in Rainmaker mode by 12%.\n\n- ▼ Time taken to begin recovering ink after ink fling attack: 70 frames → 80 frames.\n\nThe Dynamo Roller is a roller I designed myself upon using my granddad's blueprints! It wound up with incredible power, but the dynamo motor does weigh it down a bit... oh, well. Anyway, ink turf with the Sprinkler and track enemies with the Echolocator, and you'll be winning in no time!(NA)\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- Official art of an Inkling holding the Dynamo Roller.\n\n- An Inkling girl at the ready with an early version of the Dynamo Roller.\n\n- An Inkling flinging ink with the Dynamo Roller at an early version of Blackbelly Skatepark.\n\n- Render with the Gold Dynamo Roller\n\n- SplatNet icon\n\nThe Dynamo Roller returns in Splatoon 2, with minor appearance changes but significant performance changes. It comes with Ink Mines and Sting Ray. Jumping before flinging ink performs a long-ranged vertical swing. The vertical swing paints a long path of ink and damages distant opponents. If it hits, the vertical fling can splat a Steelhead in only one shot.\n\nIt appears in two Octo Expansion stations:\n\n- B03 Spin Docto Station\n\n- G02 Hasta La Vista Station\n\n- The Dynamo Roller is a heavyweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 185.

The motor does weigh it down a smidge, but the Ink Mines wait until someone gets too close before splashing ink everywhere! And the Sting Ray can take down enemies from a comfortable distance! The set appeals to those too stubborn to give up inked turf.\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- An Inkling boy about to fling the Dynamo Roller.\n\n- An Inkling boy rolling the Dynamo Roller.\n\nThe Dynamo Roller returns in Splatoon 3 with a new design and has Sprinklers and Tacticooler as its kit.\n\nIt appears in two missions in Return of the Mammalians:\n\n- 0509 Low Viz, High Risk\n\n- 0512 You'll Go Far If You Shoot Far\n\n- The Dynamo Roller is a heavyweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 18.5.

Now, I wasn't able to reduce the weight on the motor as much as I would have liked, but this thing can REALLY spill some ink, if I do say so myself. Pair it with the Sprinkler sub, and you can push forward to apply max pressure to the other team. And what will your team be doing, you ask? Why, relaxing and enjoying sweet, sugary sips from your Tacticooler, of course. You'll be the most popular teammate around!\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- Screenshot of An Octoling with the Dynamo Roller approaching the Splat Zone.\n\n- 2D icon.\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Dynamo Roller.\n\n- The Dynamo Roller at the top, representing team Power in the Power vs. Wisdom vs. Courage Splatfest.\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Dynamo_Roller_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nThe Dynamo Roller model rotating.
