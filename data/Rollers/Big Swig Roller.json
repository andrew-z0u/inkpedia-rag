    "The Big Swig Roller is a main weapon in Splatoon 3, created by the weapon brand Splat.",
    "It was revealed in the Chill Season 2022 trailer on 14 November 2022 and was released on 1 December 2022.",
    "The Big Swig Roller has a plastic appearance, akin to a cup holder. A paper cup, being used as the ink tank, is held in a small bracket, and the plastic straw from it is fed into the roller sleeve to provide ink to the roller. The handle of the Big Swig Roller is inverted from the player's ink color.",
    "The Big Swig Roller comes with Splash Walls and the Ink Vac. It outputs large amounts of ink while rolling and flinging, similar to the Dynamo Roller, but it rolls and flings at a higher speed, similar to the Splat Roller. It also has a long-range vertical flick, similar to the Flingza Roller, and rolling does not splat opponents similar to the Carbon Roller. It is the only roller that is incapable of splatting an opponent with one grounded fling. It was added along with Chill Season 2022 on 1 December 2022.",

    "- The Big Swig Roller is the only main weapon made by the Splat brand that does not include the word \"Splat\" in its name.",
    "- The Big Swig Roller is not included in Return of the Mammalians due to it being added post-release.",
    "- While the textures for most objects in the game that change color are black, and gain their appearance from having another color layered on top, the plain texture for the bottom portion of the Big Swig Roller's handle is instead indigo.",
    "The word swig refers to drinking a beverage in large gulps, referencing the weapon's design which includes cup and straw, alongside the larger area it turfs while rolling. Its name may also be a reference to the 7-Eleven drink line Big Gulp combined with \"big wig\", an 18th-century term for an important or influential person based on the tendency for such persons to wear actual big wigs."
