A paper cup, being used as the ink tank, is held in a small bracket, and the plastic straw from it is fed into the roller sleeve to provide ink to the roller. The handle of the Big Swig Roller is inverted from the player's ink color.\n\nThe Big Swig Roller comes with Splash Walls and the Ink Vac. It outputs large amounts of ink while rolling and flinging, similar to the Dynamo Roller, but it rolls and flings at a higher speed, similar to the Splat Roller. It also has a long-range vertical flick, similar to the Flingza Roller, and rolling does not splat opponents similar to the Carbon Roller. It is the only roller that is incapable of splatting an opponent with one grounded fling. It was added along with Chill Season 2022 on 1 December 2022.\n\n- The Big Swig Roller is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 12.5. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- Ink consumption per second while rolling scales from 0.6% to 3% depending on the rolling speed.\n\n- While rolling, the player's movement speed is set to 0.118 units per frame.\n\n- After rolling for 0.5 seconds, the player begins to dash.\n\n- When dashing, the player's movement speed is set to 0.142 units per frame.\n\n- After rolling, there is a 20 frame second cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Hitting an opponent while rolling deals 70 damage.\n\n- While rolling, the Big Swig Roller leaves an ink trail that is 6.8 units wide.\n\n- The ink consumption of 9% allows players to attack 11 times before needing to refill the ink supply.\n\n- When attacking with a nearly depleted ink tank, the ink consumption of that attack is reduced to 4.5%. The damage of that attack is reduced to 25% of the normal amount, and the speed in which the globs of ink move is reduced to 50% of the normal amount, effectively reducing its range.\n\n- When attacking, it takes 18 frames to lift the roller (0.3 seconds).\n\n- When attacking while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.072 units per frame.\n\n- After swinging, there is a 45 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Attacks have a base damage of 70.\n\n- For normal attacks, ink loses damage based on distance traveled. Ink starts losing damage at 4.2 units and stops losing damage at 8.2 units. The minimum damage before time-based falloff is applied is 40.\n\n- If a glob of ink is in the air for more than 30 frames after being flung, it loses damage each frame until frame 55, at which point it will deal 50% of its original damage. Thus, the minimum damage that can be dealt per glob is is 20.\n\n- Ink flung from the center of the roller does the greatest damage. Ink that is flung at an angle greater than 12.0 degrees to the left or right will have lower damage. This low-damage ink starts losing damage after traveling a distance of 2.0 units and stops losing damage at 7.7 units. The maximum damage is 70 and the minimum damage is 40.\n\n- The ink consumption of 9% allows players to attack 11 times before needing to refill the ink supply.\n\n- When attacking with a nearly depleted ink tank, the ink consumption of that attack is reduced to 4.5%. The damage of that attack is reduced to 50% of the normal amount, and the speed in which the globs of ink move is reduced to 70% of the normal amount, effectively reducing its range.\n\n- When attacking, it takes 20 frames to lift the roller (0.33 seconds).\n\n- When attacking while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.072 units per frame.\n\n- After swinging, there is a 50 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Attacks have a base damage of 120.\n\n- For normal attacks, ink loses damage based on distance traveled. Ink starts losing damage at 5.2 units and stops losing damage at 16.0 units. The minimum damage before time-based falloff is applied is 40.\n\n- The lethal range is 7.7 units, as this is the farthest distance where ink deals 100 damage.\n\n- If a glob of ink is in the air for more than 40 frames after being flung, it loses damage each frame until frame 65, at which point it will deal 50% of its original damage. Thus, the minimum damage that can be dealt per glob is is 20.\n\n- Damage does not change based on the angle of the ink.\n\n[1][2]\n\n- ▲ The minimum damage from horizontal slashes has increased from 30.0 to 35.0.\n\n- ▲ Roughly doubled the amount of damage dealt to nonplayer objects (Splash Walls, brellas, etc.) when striking them with ink.\n\n- ▲  Adjusted the damage-falloff rate based on vertical-swing distance, making the amount of damage fall off more gradually than before.\nDue to this change, the distance where 100.0+ damage can be dealt was extended by roughly 15%, and the distance where 50.0+ damage can be dealt was extended by roughly 49%.\nDistance where 100.0 damage is dealt: 6.7 units → 7.7 units.\nDistance where 50.0 damage is dealt: 9.7 units → 14.5 units.\nMinimum distance where 40.0 damage is dealt: 13.2 units → 16 units.\n\n- Due to this change, the distance where 100.0+ damage can be dealt was extended by roughly 15%, and the distance where 50.0+ damage can be dealt was extended by roughly 49%.\nDistance where 100.0 damage is dealt: 6.7 units → 7.7 units.\nDistance where 50.0 damage is dealt: 9.7 units → 14.5 units.\nMinimum distance where 40.0 damage is dealt: 13.2 units → 16 units.\n\n- Distance where 100.0 damage is dealt: 6.7 units → 7.7 units.\n\n- Distance where 50.0 damage is dealt: 9.7 units → 14.5 units.\n\n- Minimum distance where 40.0 damage is dealt: 13.2 units → 16 units.\n\n- Due to this change, the distance where 100.0+ damage can be dealt was extended by roughly 15%, and the distance where 50.0+ damage can be dealt was extended by roughly 49%.\nDistance where 100.0 damage is dealt: 6.7 units → 7.7 units.\nDistance where 50.0 damage is dealt: 9.7 units → 14.5 units.\nMinimum distance where 40.0 damage is dealt: 13.2 units → 16 units.\n\n- Distance where 100.0 damage is dealt: 6.7 units → 7.7 units.\n\n- Distance where 50.0 damage is dealt: 9.7 units → 14.5 units.\n\n- Minimum distance where 40.0 damage is dealt: 13.2 units → 16 units.\n\n- Distance where 100.0 damage is dealt: 6.7 units → 7.7 units.\n\n- Distance where 50.0 damage is dealt: 9.7 units → 14.5 units.\n\n- Minimum distance where 40.0 damage is dealt: 13.2 units → 16 units.\n\n- ▲ Increased the damage dealt when holding the  Button to ink while moving forward by approximately 42%: 70 → 100.\n\n- ▲ Points to fill special gauge: 200 → 190.\n\n- ▲ Reduced the amount of ink consumed for horizontal swings and vertical swings by approximately 10%: 10% → 9%.\n\n- ▲ Increased the damage horizontal swings deal to distant opponents from 35.0 to 40.0.\nThere is no change to the damage at distances that deal 50.0 damage or higher.\n\n- There is no change to the damage at distances that deal 50.0 damage or higher.\n\n- There is no change to the damage at distances that deal 50.0 damage or higher.\n\n- ▲ Slightly expanded vertical swings’ collision detection with players to make it easier to hit opponents.\n\n- ▲ Points to fill special gauge: 190 → 180.\n\nYou ever think to yourself...\"This roller is great, but what if it were WIDER?\" If so, the Big Swig Roller may be just what you wanted! They've taken a regular roller and just...made the roller part bigger! The result is that you can lay down a veritable red carpet—or green, or pink, or...you get it—of ink. Horizontal swings also hit a wider range, and vertical swings launch farther. The drawback is that attack power is lower than other rollers. That may not be an issue when you're hiding behind a Splash Wall, or when you can guzzle enemy ink with the Ink Vac special, so the set is actually pretty well-balanced. If you can't stand to see even a single spot of un-inked turf, give this set a try!\n\n- An Inkling rolling the Big Swig Roller\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Big Swig Roller.\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Big_Swig_Roller_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nPromotional video (link to file)\n\nFor competitive tips about the Big Swig Roller\n\n- The Big Swig Roller is the only main weapon made by the Splat brand that does not include the word \"Splat\" in its name.\n\n- The Big Swig Roller is not included in Return of the Mammalians due to it being added post-release.\n\n- While the textures for most objects in the game that change color are black, and gain their appearance from having another color layered on top, the plain texture for the bottom portion of the Big Swig Roller's handle is instead indigo.\n\nThe word swig refers to drinking a beverage in large gulps, referencing the weapon's design which includes cup and straw, alongside the larger area it turfs while rolling. Its name may also be a reference to the 7-Eleven drink line Big Gulp combined with \"big wig\", an 18th-century term for an important or influential person based on the tendency for such persons to wear actual big wigs."
