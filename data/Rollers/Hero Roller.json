    "The Hero Roller is a roller in Splatoon and Splatoon 2 that is exclusively used in single player modes.",
    "In Splatoon, the Hero Roller looks like the Splat Roller but with a more futuristic design with a black and lime green color scheme shared with all the Hero Weapons, and many blue lights that leave a small trail as Agent 3 moves. In Splatoon 2, the Hero Roller used by Agent 4 has a new and sleeker design with yellow supports instead of black, looking similar to the Carbon Roller.",
    "The Hero Roller functions similarly to the Splat Roller, being able to fling a decent amount of ink and spread ink by rolling it on the ground. It cannot be upgraded with Power Eggs like the Hero Shot, and unlike the Hero Shot, it only comes with Splat Bombs. It is exclusively used by the player during the Inkling Boy amiibo challenges, and completing them all unlocks the Hero Roller Replica for purchase at Ammo Knights.",

    "The Hero Roller is usable in Octo Canyon without the use of amiibo and can be upgraded one level. Unlike the first game, they now come with switchable sub weapons of Splat Bombs, Curling Bombs and Autobombs. It is loaned by Sheldon during the level Enter the Octohurler and can be used in all other missions after beating the level. Completing all the missions in Octo Canyon with the Hero Roller unlocks the Hero Roller Replica for purchase at Ammo Knights.",
    "The Hero Roller Replica is a reward in Splatoon and Splatoon 2. It is unlocked in Splatoon 2  by completing all Octo Canyon levels with the Hero Roller, while in Splatoon various amiibo challenges must be completed. It is a roller-type main weapon and is visually identical to the Hero Roller; Despite its unique appearance, it is simply a reskin of the Splat Roller from that game, sharing the same stats and loadout.",
    "- Callie's main weapon is shown to be the Hero Roller as it appears in Splatoon or its replica, likely from her time in the role of Agent 1. This is shown in her artwork for the Show No Mercy! vs. Focus on Healing Splatfest.",
    "- The Hero Roller's design in Splatoon 2 resembles the Carbon Roller, despite its Level 1 and its associated Replica's stats being similar to the Splat Roller.",
    "- The Splatoon 2 design of the Hero Roller appears in a banner in Splatoon 3.",
    "- The Hero Roller spreading Ink.",
    "- The Hero Roller splatting an enemy.",
