    "The Octobrush Nouveau was released on 1 January 2016 at 10:00 UTC.[1] The Octobrush Nouveau is a variation of the Octobrush, maintaining the same stats, but instead comes with Splat Bombs and the Inkzooka. This weapon has a critical damage mechanic, sometimes allowing for two-hit splats. The probability of scoring a two-hit splat can be increased using Damage Up.",

    "- In the first two games, this weapon was released to coincide with the Japanese tradition of kakizome (\"first writing\"), which is when one writes their first calligraphy of the year. SplatoonJP's Tweet on the weapon's release in Splatoon acknowledges this, jokingly telling players to have their \"first inking.\"",
    "Octobrush is a combination of octo (Latin for \"eight\"; likely referring the octopus-shaped ink reservoir) and brush. The suffix Nouveau is used to differentiate it from the Octobrush and might also referring the Art Nouveau. This trait is shared among the other alternate sets of the Nouveau brand."
