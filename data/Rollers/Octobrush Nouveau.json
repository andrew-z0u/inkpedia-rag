That said, it offers the same level of performance you may already know from the Octobrush but with a loadout designed for teamwork. Use your Squid Beakons to rally teammates to critical spots on the map, whether attacking or retreating. Nothing zips you back to the fray as quickly! And when you're on the front line, the Ink Storm special is a great way to hold your position. I recommend this set for aggressive players who splat and get splatted up front!\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Octobrush Nouveau\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Octobrush_Nouveau_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nModel of the Octobrush Nouveau rotating (Link to file)\n\nFor competitive tips about the Octobrush Nouveau\n\n- In the first two games, this weapon was released to coincide with the Japanese tradition of kakizome (\"first writing\"), which is when one writes their first calligraphy of the year. SplatoonJP's Tweet on the weapon's release in Splatoon acknowledges this, jokingly telling players to have their \"first inking.\"\n\nOctobrush is a combination of octo (Latin for \"eight\"; likely referring the octopus-shaped ink reservoir) and brush. The suffix Nouveau is used to differentiate it from the Octobrush and might also referring the Art Nouveau. This trait is shared among the other alternate sets of the Nouveau brand."
