  "content": "The Carbon Roller is a main weapon in the Splatoon series.\n\nCompared to the basic Splat Roller, the Carbon Roller is the lighter and more mobile roller. It has an incredibly fast flick that still splats opponents in one hit. However, its attack power and range is weaker, and it is unable to crush opponents in one hit.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Splatoon\n\n2.1 Data\n2.2 Version history\n2.3 Quotes\n2.4 Gallery\n2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3 Splatoon 2\n\n3.1 Data\n\n3.1.1 Horizontal swing (while grounded)\n3.1.2 Vertical swing (while in midair)\n\n\n3.2 Version history\n3.3 Quotes\n3.4 Gallery\n3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n3.1.1 Horizontal swing (while grounded)\n3.1.2 Vertical swing (while in midair)\n\n- 3.1.1 Horizontal swing (while grounded)\n\n- 3.1.2 Vertical swing (while in midair)\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 4 Splatoon 3\n\n4.1 Data\n\n4.1.1 Horizontal swing (while grounded)\n4.1.2 Vertical swing (while in midair)\n\n\n4.2 Version history\n4.3 Quotes\n4.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n4.5 Gallery\n\n- 4.1 Data\n\n4.1.1 Horizontal swing (while grounded)\n4.1.2 Vertical swing (while in midair)\n\n- 4.1.1 Horizontal swing (while grounded)\n\n- 4.1.2 Vertical swing (while in midair)\n\n- 4.2 Version history\n\n- 4.3 Quotes\n\n- 4.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 4.5 Gallery\n\n- 5 Strategy\n\n- 6 Trivia\n\n- 7 Etymology\n\n7.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 7.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 8 References\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n3.1.1 Horizontal swing (while grounded)\n3.1.2 Vertical swing (while in midair)\n\n- 3.1.1 Horizontal swing (while grounded)\n\n- 3.1.2 Vertical swing (while in midair)\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3.1.1 Horizontal swing (while grounded)\n\n- 3.1.2 Vertical swing (while in midair)\n\n- 4.1 Data\n\n4.1.1 Horizontal swing (while grounded)\n4.1.2 Vertical swing (while in midair)\n\n- 4.1.1 Horizontal swing (while grounded)\n\n- 4.1.2 Vertical swing (while in midair)\n\n- 4.2 Version history\n\n- 4.3 Quotes\n\n- 4.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 4.5 Gallery\n\n- 4.1.1 Horizontal swing (while grounded)\n\n- 4.1.2 Vertical swing (while in midair)\n\n- 7.1 Names in other languages\n\nThe main parts of the Carbon Roller are an ink tank and a cylindrical roller frame, both of which change color to match the user's ink. Unlike the other rollers, the frame is attached to both sides of the paint roller. The frame of the roller resembles that of a bicycle, and the ink tank is connected to it by a bike's bottle holder, and the tank itself is designed to look like a sports bottle. The roller frame has red supports on either side connecting it to the ink tank. The supports curve around to make a handle at the end of the tank, looking like a handlebar from a bike, having what resembles a brake lever on the back. The ends of the paint roller are covered with black disks. The roller itself has a series of stripe indents across it, and is coated with the player's ink when their tank is not empty.\n\nIn Splatoon 3, the Carbon Roller retains its design from the previous games, but its frame now has a yellow-orange and black color scheme.\n\nIn Splatoon, the ink tank is white with a gray logo, white with a black logo in Splatoon 2, and the user's ink color and black with a different black logo in Splatoon 3. In Splatoon and Splatoon 2, there is Inkling text on one half of the black disks on the end of the roller, and arrows around the other half's circumference. In Splatoon 3, there is a different design with a white logo encased in a white dashed circle, which is encased in two arrows around the circumference of the disk, one yellow, one light blue.\n\nThe Carbon Roller was released on 27 June 2015 at 02:00 UTC.[1] It comes with Burst Bombs and Inkzooka.\n\nEach flick consumes 3.5% of the ink tank capacity, allowing players to fling 28 times before needing to refill.\n\n- The Carbon Roller is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- Ink consumption while rolling is 6% per second.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- Ink consumption per attack is 3.5%.\nThis allows players to attack 28 times before needing to refill the ink supply.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This allows players to attack 28 times before needing to refill the ink supply.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- The weapon can attack with a depleted ink tank, but the damage of that attack is reduced to 40% of the normal amount.\n\n- Rolling with a depleted ink tank will not leave a trail or damage opponents.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This allows players to attack 28 times before needing to refill the ink supply.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- When attacking, it takes 9 frames to lift the roller (0.15 seconds).\n\n- When rolling, the player's movement speed is set to 1.44 units per frame.\n\n- When rolling on an uninkable surface or with a depleted ink tank, the player's movement speed is set to 0.96 units per frame.\n\n- After rolling, there is a 0.33 second cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- After swinging, there is a 0.67 second cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Hitting an opponent while rolling deals 70 damage.\n\n- Attacks have a base damage of 125.\n\n- For normal attacks, ink loses damage based on distance traveled. Ink starts losing damage at 45 units and stops losing damage at 80 units. The minimum damage is 25.\n\n- Ink globs travel straight for 3 frames.\n\n- Ink flung from the center of the roller does the greatest damage. Ink that flies to the left or right will have lower damage. This low-damage ink starts losing damage after traveling a distance of 71 units and stops losing damage at 80 units. The maximum damage is 50 and the minimum damage is 25.\n\n- When rolling, the Carbon Roller leaves an ink trail that is 44 units wide.\n\n[2]\n\n- ▼ Players can only splat their opponents in one hit with the center of the roller.\n\n- ▼ Opponents cannot be splatted in one hit when the player is out of ink.\n\n- – Amount of damage given when the roller is repeatedly swung balanced.\n\n- ▼ Special gauge loss: 50% → 60%.\n\n- ▲ Reduced ink used when swinging roller by 30%: 5% → 3.5%.\n\nThe Carbon Roller is a lightweight roller built with low-density parts for increased handling!

This is slightly impaired by the fact that it will cover a little bit less surface area than most rollers, even though it is very quick. It is very useful to cover ground quickly, but is lacking in mid-to long range combat.\n\nIt appears in two Octo Expansion stations:\n\n- B12 Brute Rollup Station\n\n- D07 Targetbuster Station\n\n- The Carbon Roller is a lightweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 95.

Of course, lightweight leads to light inking capability, but if you can find an opponent with an Autobomb and then sneak behind them, it'll get the job done. Rounding out this zippy little loadout is the Zipcaster, which can also help you surprise and undelight your opponents.
