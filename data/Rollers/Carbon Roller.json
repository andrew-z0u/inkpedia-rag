    "The Carbon Roller is a main weapon in the Splatoon series.",
    "Compared to the basic Splat Roller, the Carbon Roller is the lighter and more mobile roller. It has an incredibly fast flick that still splats opponents in one hit. However, its attack power and range is weaker, and it is unable to crush opponents in one hit.",
    "The main parts of the Carbon Roller are an ink tank and a cylindrical roller frame, both of which change color to match the user's ink. Unlike the other rollers, the frame is attached to both sides of the paint roller. The frame of the roller resembles that of a bicycle, and the ink tank is connected to it by a bike's bottle holder, and the tank itself is designed to look like a sports bottle. The roller frame has red supports on either side connecting it to the ink tank. The supports curve around to make a handle at the end of the tank, looking like a handlebar from a bike, having what resembles a brake lever on the back. The ends of the paint roller are covered with black disks. The roller itself has a series of stripe indents across it, and is coated with the player's ink when their tank is not empty.",
    "In Splatoon 3, the Carbon Roller retains its design from the previous games, but its frame now has a yellow-orange and black color scheme.",
    "In Splatoon, the ink tank is white with a gray logo, white with a black logo in Splatoon 2, and the user's ink color and black with a different black logo in Splatoon 3. In Splatoon and Splatoon 2, there is Inkling text on one half of the black disks on the end of the roller, and arrows around the other half's circumference. In Splatoon 3, there is a different design with a white logo encased in a white dashed circle, which is encased in two arrows around the circumference of the disk, one yellow, one light blue.",
    "The Carbon Roller was released on 27 June 2015 at 02:00 UTC.[1] It comes with Burst Bombs and Inkzooka.",
    "Each flick consumes 3.5% of the ink tank capacity, allowing players to fling 28 times before needing to refill.",
    "[2]",
    "The Carbon Roller is a lightweight roller built with low-density parts for increased handling! Soften up the foe with Burst Bombs while you ink the ground and prepare to unleash the Inkzooka! Want to use a roller but don't like feeling weighed down? Now you can have your cake and eat it too!",
    "The Carbon Roller returns in Splatoon 2 with Autobombs and Ink Storm.",
    "Each flick consumes 4% of the ink tank capacity, allowing players to fling 25 times before needing to refill.",
    "The Carbon Roller is much faster than almost any other roller in the game, and is very ink-efficient, allowing players to cover large amounts of turf quickly. This is slightly impaired by the fact that it will cover a little bit less surface area than most rollers, even though it is very quick. It is very useful to cover ground quickly, but is lacking in mid-to long range combat.",
    "It appears in two Octo Expansion stations:",
    "[3][4]",
    "The Carbon Roller is a lightweight roller built using low-density parts for increased handling! You can't fling a whole lot of ink with this one, so use an Autobomb to check if the area's safe before you ink ahead! A well-placed Ink Storm over an enemy's hiding place will send them running. Little do they know that you're waiting to splat them!",
    "The Carbon Roller returns in Splatoon 3 with a slightly updated design that is primarily yellow-orange instead of pink. It has kept the Autobombs and now has Zipcaster.",
    "It appears in three missions in Return of the Mammalians:",
    "[5][6]",
    "The Carbon Roller is a lightweight roller built using low-density parts for increased handling! Of course, lightweight leads to light inking capability, but if you can find an opponent with an Autobomb and then sneak behind them, it'll get the job done. Rounding out this zippy little loadout is the Zipcaster, which can also help you surprise and undelight your opponents. Basically, if you want to be a ninja, try out this set!",
    "For competitive tips about the Carbon Roller",
    "Carbon refers to carbon fiber, a very light material from which many bicycle frames are made of, which the Carbon Roller is designed after.",
