However, the strip across the ink tank is white, the metal handle is dark blue with black grips, and there is an extra silver-gray attachment on the right side of the roller. The CoroCoro logo is also debossed into the actual roller, alongside a CoroCoro decal on the weapon's ink tank and a decal of its dragon mascot on the side of the roller part.\n\nThe CoroCoro Splat Roller was first announced in CoroCoro Comic,[1] which also revealed the CoroCoro Cap and the CoroCoro Hoodie. It was one of eight weapons included in Sheldon's Picks Vol. 2 and was released on 8 June 2016 at 02:00 UTC.[2]\n\nThe CoroCoro Splat Roller comes with Splash Walls and the Inkzooka.\n\n- The CoroCoro Splat Roller is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- Ink consumption while rolling is 6% per second.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- Ink consumption per attack is 9%.\nThis allows players to attack 11 times before needing to refill the ink supply.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This allows players to attack 11 times before needing to refill the ink supply.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- The weapon can attack with a depleted ink tank, but the damage of that attack is reduced to 40% of the normal amount.\n\n- Rolling with a depleted ink tank will not leave a trail or damage opponents.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This allows players to attack 11 times before needing to refill the ink supply.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- When attacking, it takes 20 frames to lift the roller (0.33 seconds).\n\n- When rolling, the player's movement speed is set to 1.2 units per frame.\n\n- When rolling on an uninkable surface or with a depleted ink tank, the player's movement speed is set to 0.96 units per frame.\n\n- After rolling, there is a 0.33 second cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- After swinging, there is a 0.75 second cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Hitting an opponent while rolling deals 140 damage.\n\n- Attacks have a base damage of 125.\n\n- For normal attacks, ink loses damage based on distance traveled. Ink starts losing damage at 65 units and stops losing damage at 105 units. The minimum damage is 25.\n\n- Ink globs travel straight for 4 frames.\n\n- Ink flung from the center of the roller does the greatest damage. Ink that flies to the left or right will have lower damage. This low-damage ink starts losing damage after traveling a distance of 95 units and stops losing damage at 105 units. The maximum damage is 50 and the minimum damage is 25.\n\n- When rolling, the CoroCoro Splat Roller leaves an ink trail that is 52 units wide.\n\n[3]\n\nThe CoroCoro Splat Roller is decorated with a cool logo I found inscribed on some ancient writings. It has a new hollow titanium frame, ball-bearing joints, steering dampers, super-stabilizers... So many new parts, in fact, that it kind of... came full circle. The specs ended up identical to the Splat Roller. But this is the first roller set with a Splash Wall! And I also threw in an Inkzooka because why not?!(NA)\n\nThe CoroCoro Splat Roller is decorated with a cool logo I found inscribed on some ancient writings.

The specs ended up identical to the Splat Roller. To make up for that, this is the first Roller with a Splash Wall! I've also added an Inkzooka. This set would suit an ambitious Roller innovator!(EU/OC)\n\n- Promotional image.\n\n- An Inkling boy holding the CoroCoro Splat Roller.\n\n- Pushing the CoroCoro Splat Roller.\n\n- Pushing it up a ramp.\n\n- Promotional render of the same Inkling posing with the CoroCoro Splat Roller.\n\n- Scan of the CoroCoro Splat Roller announcement in CoroCoro Comic.\n\n- SplatNet icon\n\n- The CoroCoro Splat Roller is the first real life-sponsored main weapon to be released.\n\n- When Sheldon is describing the weapon, he says he decorated it with a logo found in ancient writings, likely CoroCoro Comic itself.\n\nCoroCoro Splat Roller is a combination of Splat and Roller plus the brand CoroCoro, a Japanese manga magazine.\n\n- CoroCoro Cap\n\n- CoroCoro Hoodie"
