However, the lavender parts of the frame are changed to yellow on the Big Swig Roller Express, and the Express logo is visible both above the joint piece as a sticker, and on the paper cup used as ink tank.\n\nThe Big Swig Roller Express was revealed on 16 May 2023 in the Sizzle Season 2023 trailer.[1] It is branded after the vending machine brand Express that makes the Tenta Missiles and the Inkjet. It comes with Angle Shooters and Ink Storm.\n\n- The Big Swig Roller Express is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 12.5. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- Ink consumption per second while rolling scales from 0.6% to 3% depending on the rolling speed.\n\n- While rolling, the player's movement speed is set to 0.118 units per frame.\n\n- After rolling for 0.5 seconds, the player begins to dash.\n\n- When dashing, the player's movement speed is set to 0.142 units per frame.\n\n- After rolling, there is a 20 frame second cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Hitting an opponent while rolling deals 70 damage.\n\n- While rolling, the Big Swig Roller Express leaves an ink trail that is 6.8 units wide.\n\n- The ink consumption of 9% allows players to attack 11 times before needing to refill the ink supply.\n\n- When attacking with a nearly depleted ink tank, the ink consumption of that attack is reduced to 4.5%. The damage of that attack is reduced to 25% of the normal amount, and the speed in which the globs of ink move is reduced to 50% of the normal amount, effectively reducing its range.\n\n- When attacking, it takes 18 frames to lift the roller (0.3 seconds).\n\n- When attacking while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.072 units per frame.\n\n- After swinging, there is a 45 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Attacks have a base damage of 70.\n\n- For normal attacks, ink loses damage based on distance traveled. Ink starts losing damage at 4.2 units and stops losing damage at 8.2 units. The minimum damage before time-based falloff is applied is 40.\n\n- If a glob of ink is in the air for more than 30 frames after being flung, it loses damage each frame until frame 55, at which point it will deal 50% of its original damage. Thus, the minimum damage that can be dealt per glob is is 20.\n\n- Ink flung from the center of the roller does the greatest damage. Ink that is flung at an angle greater than 12.0 degrees to the left or right will have lower damage. This low-damage ink starts losing damage after traveling a distance of 2.0 units and stops losing damage at 7.7 units. The maximum damage is 70 and the minimum damage is 40.\n\n- The ink consumption of 9% allows players to attack 11 times before needing to refill the ink supply.\n\n- When attacking with a nearly depleted ink tank, the ink consumption of that attack is reduced to 4.5%. The damage of that attack is reduced to 50% of the normal amount, and the speed in which the globs of ink move is reduced to 70% of the normal amount, effectively reducing its range.\n\n- When attacking, it takes 20 frames to lift the roller (0.33 seconds).\n\n- When attacking while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.072 units per frame.\n\n- After swinging, there is a 50 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Attacks have a base damage of 120.\n\n- For normal attacks, ink loses damage based on distance traveled. Ink starts losing damage at 5.2 units and stops losing damage at 16.0 units. The minimum damage before time-based falloff is applied is 40.\n\n- The lethal range is 7.7 units, as this is the farthest distance where ink deals 100 damage.\n\n- If a glob of ink is in the air for more than 40 frames after being flung, it loses damage each frame until frame 65, at which point it will deal 50% of its original damage. Thus, the minimum damage that can be dealt per glob is is 20.\n\n- Damage does not change based on the angle of the ink.\n\n[2][3]\n\n- ▲ Reduced the amount of ink consumed for horizontal swings and vertical swings by approximately 10%: 10% → 9%.\n\n- ▲ Points to fill special gauge: 200 → 190.\n\n- ▲ Increased the damage horizontal swings deal to distant opponents from 35.0 to 40.0.\nThere is no change to the damage at distances that deal 50.0 damage or higher.\n\n- There is no change to the damage at distances that deal 50.0 damage or higher.\n\n- There is no change to the damage at distances that deal 50.0 damage or higher.\n\n- ▲ Slightly expanded vertical swings’ collision detection with players to make it easier to hit opponents.\n\n- ▲ Points to fill special gauge: 190 → 180.\n\nThe Big Swig Roller Express is an exciting collaboration between the makers of the Big Swig Roller and a vending-machine maker! In addition to the new design, it now comes with the Angle Shooter sub, making it easy to tag enemies and take a sip of their health bar while you're at it. Plus, you can fire up the Ink Storm special to drive the other team into the open, and then finish them off with the roller. Talk about convenient! I guess that's the vending-machine influence paying off.\n\n- Promotional render\n\n- The bottom right card is for the Big Swig Roller Express.\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Big Swig Roller Express.\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Big_Swig_Roller_Express_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nModel of the Big Swig Roller Express rotating (link to file)\n\nFor competitive tips about the Big Swig Roller Express\n\n- Along with the Annaki Splattershot Nova, the Big Swig Roller Express is the only weapon made by the Splat brand that has the actual name of the brand it was created with in almost every translation of the game instead of suffixes meaning \"logo\" or \"branded\" like the other Splat weapons. Coincidentally, the base forms of both of these weapons both come from Chill Season 2022.\n\n- The Big Swig Roller Express is the first and only weapon to be a variant in collaboration with a brand that is not a gear brand, as is the case with other branded variants in the series."
