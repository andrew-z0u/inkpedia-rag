    "The Splat Roller is a main weapon in the Splatoon series.",
    "The Splat Roller is a large paint roller. It covers turf while the player pushes it and can be used as a melee weapon. After pressing , it flings ink at a short range. If the player continues to hold down , the Splat Roller touches the ground and can leave a wide trail of ink identical to the player's movements for as long as the player holds . Enemies who come into direct contact with the roller while it is being pushed are splatted instantly. At close range, well-aimed fling attacks will splat opponents with one hit.",
    "The Splat Roller is reminiscent of an over-sized version of a paint roller commonly used to paint walls. Its ink tank is always near-identical to that of the Splattershot of the game it is in. The weapon is usually kept folded up into a more compact state, folded along a joint in the middle, and is unfolded for its horizontal swings and when rolling along the ground, and is kept folded up when used for vertical swings. The paint roller portion of it is covered in round indents, and is usually covered in a thick coating of the user's ink, but when the user is out of ink, most of it is faded and the texture of the roller is visible underneath. The frame of the weapon is only attached to one side of the paint roller, another element taken from its real-life counterpart.",
    "In Splatoon, the frame of the weapon is mostly dark green with the handle grips being yellow-green, along with the joint that connects the top part of the roller to the rest of the frame. There is a small ink tank located in the middle of the frame, connected to it via its yellow-green strap, and a large piece of green and red plastic connected to the bottom of the hinge, with the frame going behind the ink tank. The roller cover is connected to the frame by the right side.",
    "In Splatoon 2, the appearance changes slightly, with the frame now being purple and the handle grips being black and simpler, resembling a rubber grip, along with the ink tank now being on the left side of the weapon, now just attached by a piece of plastic connected to the opening on the top of the ink tank, and is pointed slightly away from the frame. Unique to this game is an extra support added in the middle of the weapon's frame, a black latch added to the weapon's hinge and another to its handle. The two ends of the paint roller now have an exposed metal bolt, surrounded by a large black metal ring.",
    "In Splatoon 3, the appearance changes significantly in some respects, having a more simplified and plastic-like design. The frame of the weapon is black, but is surrounded by a purple plastic casing. The black frame is exposed in a few parts of the weapon - the hinge is now partly black, as well as the part of the frame on the roller-side connected to the hinge, and the bottom of the frame, which connects to a further-simplified black grip. The hinge is also much more simplified and rounded. The casing on the handle-side of the roller has a large protrusion that it is held by when it is unfolded. The roller-side of the frame has a black pad connected to it by yellow plastic, likely acting as a mudguard. The two ends of the paint roller now have a yellow plastic rim, and the exposed metal bolts on the ends are more large and prominent, with a wavy edge on the part connected to the frame, and two protruding metal loops on the other end. The ink tank still is on the side and points slightly away from the frame, but it no longer has any extra element connecting it, instead connected by the wavy yellow plastic surrounding it. The ink tank is also reversed compared to the tank on the other games' rollers, meaning the screw top of it is not connected to the frame itself, and instead protrudes.",
    "The Splat Roller comes with Suction Bombs and Killer Wail.",

    "The Splat Roller represents the Roller class of weapons, useful for close combat and also for inking turf. Tap  to fling ink at foes, or hold it down to ink the ground as you run! Rollers began as unofficial weapons but became so popular that they're now an officially recognized style! The included Suction Bombs and Killer Wail are powerful too, so this is a great set to learn the Roller ropes.(NA)",

    "The Splat Roller returns in Splatoon 2 with a new visual design and a new vertical swing mechanic. When flicked while jumping, ink travels in a vertical line rather than a horizontal splash, and it travels much farther than a grounded flick. It comes with Curling Bombs and Splashdown.",
    "It appears in seven Octo Expansion stations:",
    "[2][3]",
    "The Splat Roller represents the roller class of weapons that excel at close combat and inking turf. Tap  to fling ink at foes, or hold it down to ink the ground as you run. Bounce a Curling Bomb off a wall to cut off your opponent's route, get right up on them, aaaaaaand SPLAT! Paired with the Splashdown, I'm pretty sure you'll have no trouble splatting multiple opponents at once! If you want to experience the basics of the new generation of rollers, look no further.",
    "The Splat Roller returns in Splatoon 3 with a new design. It keeps its vertical swing mechanic from Splatoon 2. It has Curling Bombs and the Big Bubbler as its kit.",
    "It appears in three missions in Return of the Mammalians:",
    "[4][5]",
    "The Splat Roller represents the roller class of weapons that excel at close combat and inking turf. With any roller, you can tap  to fling ink, or hold  down as you run to lay down a path of inky goodness. Try using your Curling Bombs to sneak up close to an enemy, and then... PLOOSH! Get 'em with the roller. It's oh so satisfying. As an added strategic wrinkle, you have the Big Bubbler to rally your team to the front line at just the right moment. If you're new to rollers, I can't recommend this loadout enough. Who knows? Maybe you'll become a roller for life!",
    "For competitive tips about the Splat Roller",
    "The Splat Roller (as it appears in Splatoon) appears as Inkling's side special attack in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, alongside a variety of other weapons used in her attacks.",
    "When executed, Inkling pulls up a roller and pushes it along the ground, covering it with ink that slows opponents walking on it. Hitting an opponent when rolling buries them, deals damage, and coats them in ink. When Inkling runs out of ink, rolling does not deal damage, will not ink the ground, and rolls much slower.",
