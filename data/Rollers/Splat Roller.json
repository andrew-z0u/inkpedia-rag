  "content": "The Splat Roller is a main weapon in the Splatoon series.\n\nThe Splat Roller is a large paint roller. It covers turf while the player pushes it and can be used as a melee weapon. After pressing , it flings ink at a short range. If the player continues to hold down , the Splat Roller touches the ground and can leave a wide trail of ink identical to the player's movements for as long as the player holds . Enemies who come into direct contact with the roller while it is being pushed are splatted instantly. At close range, well-aimed fling attacks will splat opponents with one hit.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Splatoon\n\n2.1 Data\n2.2 Version history\n2.3 Quotes\n2.4 Gallery\n\n2.4.1 Promotional\n2.4.2 In-game\n\n\n2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n2.4.1 Promotional\n2.4.2 In-game\n\n- 2.4.1 Promotional\n\n- 2.4.2 In-game\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3 Splatoon 2\n\n3.1 Data\n\n3.1.1 Horizontal swing (while grounded)\n3.1.2 Vertical swing (while in midair)\n\n\n3.2 Version history\n3.3 Quotes\n3.4 Gallery\n3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n3.1.1 Horizontal swing (while grounded)\n3.1.2 Vertical swing (while in midair)\n\n- 3.1.1 Horizontal swing (while grounded)\n\n- 3.1.2 Vertical swing (while in midair)\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 4 Splatoon 3\n\n4.1 Data\n\n4.1.1 Horizontal swing (while grounded)\n4.1.2 Vertical swing (while in midair)\n\n\n4.2 Version history\n4.3 Quotes\n4.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n4.5 Gallery\n\n- 4.1 Data\n\n4.1.1 Horizontal swing (while grounded)\n4.1.2 Vertical swing (while in midair)\n\n- 4.1.1 Horizontal swing (while grounded)\n\n- 4.1.2 Vertical swing (while in midair)\n\n- 4.2 Version history\n\n- 4.3 Quotes\n\n- 4.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 4.5 Gallery\n\n- 5 Strategy\n\n- 6 In other games\n\n6.1 Super Smash Bros.

Ultimate\n\n- 8.1 Translation notes\n\nThe Splat Roller is reminiscent of an over-sized version of a paint roller commonly used to paint walls. Its ink tank is always near-identical to that of the Splattershot of the game it is in. The weapon is usually kept folded up into a more compact state, folded along a joint in the middle, and is unfolded for its horizontal swings and when rolling along the ground, and is kept folded up when used for vertical swings. The paint roller portion of it is covered in round indents, and is usually covered in a thick coating of the user's ink, but when the user is out of ink, most of it is faded and the texture of the roller is visible underneath. The frame of the weapon is only attached to one side of the paint roller, another element taken from its real-life counterpart.\n\nIn Splatoon, the frame of the weapon is mostly dark green with the handle grips being yellow-green, along with the joint that connects the top part of the roller to the rest of the frame. There is a small ink tank located in the middle of the frame, connected to it via its yellow-green strap, and a large piece of green and red plastic connected to the bottom of the hinge, with the frame going behind the ink tank. The roller cover is connected to the frame by the right side.\n\nIn Splatoon 2, the appearance changes slightly, with the frame now being purple and the handle grips being black and simpler, resembling a rubber grip, along with the ink tank now being on the left side of the weapon, now just attached by a piece of plastic connected to the opening on the top of the ink tank, and is pointed slightly away from the frame. Unique to this game is an extra support added in the middle of the weapon's frame, a black latch added to the weapon's hinge and another to its handle. The two ends of the paint roller now have an exposed metal bolt, surrounded by a large black metal ring.\n\nIn Splatoon 3, the appearance changes significantly in some respects, having a more simplified and plastic-like design. The frame of the weapon is black, but is surrounded by a purple plastic casing. The black frame is exposed in a few parts of the weapon - the hinge is now partly black, as well as the part of the frame on the roller-side connected to the hinge, and the bottom of the frame, which connects to a further-simplified black grip. The hinge is also much more simplified and rounded. The casing on the handle-side of the roller has a large protrusion that it is held by when it is unfolded. The roller-side of the frame has a black pad connected to it by yellow plastic, likely acting as a mudguard. The two ends of the paint roller now have a yellow plastic rim, and the exposed metal bolts on the ends are more large and prominent, with a wavy edge on the part connected to the frame, and two protruding metal loops on the other end. The ink tank still is on the side and points slightly away from the frame, but it no longer has any extra element connecting it, instead connected by the wavy yellow plastic surrounding it. The ink tank is also reversed compared to the tank on the other games' rollers, meaning the screw top of it is not connected to the frame itself, and instead protrudes.\n\nThe Splat Roller comes with Suction Bombs and Killer Wail.\n\n- The Splat Roller is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- Ink consumption while rolling is 6% per second.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- Ink consumption per attack is 9%.\nThis allows players to attack 11 times before needing to refill the ink supply.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This allows players to attack 11 times before needing to refill the ink supply.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- The weapon can attack with a depleted ink tank, but the damage of that attack is reduced to 40% of the normal amount.\n\n- Rolling with a depleted ink tank will not leave a trail or damage opponents.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This allows players to attack 11 times before needing to refill the ink supply.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- When attacking, it takes 20 frames to lift the roller (0.33 seconds).\n\n- When rolling, the player's movement speed is set to 1.2 units per frame.\n\n- When rolling on an uninkable surface or with a depleted ink tank, the player's movement speed is set to 0.96 units per frame.\n\n- After rolling, there is a 0.33 second cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- After swinging, there is a 0.75 second cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Hitting an opponent while rolling deals 140 damage.\n\n- Attacks have a base damage of 125.\n\n- For normal attacks, ink loses damage based on distance traveled. Ink starts losing damage at 65 units and stops losing damage at 105 units. The minimum damage is 25.\n\n- Ink globs travel straight for 4 frames.\n\n- Ink flung from the center of the roller does the greatest damage. Ink that flies to the left or right will have lower damage. This low-damage ink starts losing damage after traveling a distance of 95 units and stops losing damage at 105 units. The maximum damage is 50 and the minimum damage is 25.\n\n- When rolling, the Splat Roller leaves an ink trail that is 52 units wide.\n\n[1]\n\n- ▼ Players can only splat their opponents in one hit with the center of the roller.\n\n- ▼ Opponents cannot be splatted in one hit when the player is out of ink.\n\n- – Amount of damage given when the roller is repeatedly swung balanced.\n\n- ▲ Special gauge loss: 50% → 40%.\n\nThe Splat Roller represents the Roller class of weapons, useful for close combat and also for inking turf. Tap  to fling ink at foes, or hold it down to ink the ground as you run! Rollers began as unofficial weapons but became so popular that they're now an officially recognized style! The included Suction Bombs and Killer Wail are powerful too, so this is a great set to learn the Roller ropes.(NA)\n\nThe Splat Roller represents the Roller class of weapons, useful for close combat and also for painting the floor.

Get 'em with the roller. It's oh so satisfying. As an added strategic wrinkle, you have the Big Bubbler to rally your team to the front line at just the right moment. If you're new to rollers, I can't recommend this loadout enough. Who knows? Maybe you'll become a roller for life!\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- An Octoling swinging the Splat Roller.\n\n- An Octoling rolling the Splat Roller.\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- 2D art for the countdown to the release of Splatoon 3, with Splat Roller being used by the Inkling on the right.\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Splat Roller.\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Splat_Roller_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nThe Splat Roller model rotating (Link to file)\n\nFor competitive tips about the Splat Roller\n\nThe Splat Roller (as it appears in Splatoon) appears as Inkling's side special attack in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, alongside a variety of other weapons used in her attacks.\n\nWhen executed, Inkling pulls up a roller and pushes it along the ground, covering it with ink that slows opponents walking on it. Hitting an opponent when rolling buries them, deals damage, and coats them in ink. When Inkling runs out of ink, rolling does not deal damage, will not ink the ground, and rolls much slower.\n\n- During the Splatoon 2 Global Testfire, the Splat Roller's sub weapon was changed to Suction Bombs.\nThe weapon, however, did have its final kit during the Switch event demo, which took place prior to the Splatoon 2 Global Testfire.\nSuction Bombs were later given to a roller with the Foil Flingza Roller, and it was given to a Splashdown set with the Goo Tuber.\n\n- The weapon, however, did have its final kit during the Switch event demo, which took place prior to the Splatoon 2 Global Testfire.\n\n- Suction Bombs were later given to a roller with the Foil Flingza Roller, and it was given to a Splashdown set with the Goo Tuber.\n\n- A mechanical clunking noise can be heard while rolling when out of ink.\nThis is also true for all rollers.\n\n- This is also true for all rollers.\n\n- The Splat Roller was one of the weapons that was available to use in the Splatoon 3 Splatfest World Premiere.\n\n- When rollers and the Curling Bomb come up on Judd's trials, the player is equipped with the Splat Roller on both occasions.\n\n- The weapon, however, did have its final kit during the Switch event demo, which took place prior to the Splatoon 2 Global Testfire.\n\n- Suction Bombs were later given to a roller with the Foil Flingza Roller, and it was given to a Splashdown set with the Goo Tuber.\n\n- This is also true for all rollers."
