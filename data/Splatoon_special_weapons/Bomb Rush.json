    "The Bomb Rush is a special weapon in Splatoon.",
    "When someone is using a Bomb Rush, their torso is surrounded by a glowing red circle. The bombs thrown from the Bomb Rush's user are visually identical to bombs thrown as sub weapons.",
    "Bomb Rush temporarily allows the player to make use of their sub weapon with no ink requirement, allowing it to be thrown or placed as fast as is allowed by that particular sub weapon. This speed varies, with Burst Bombs being thrown more quickly than Suction Bombs.",
    "Bomb Rush can be used with:",
    "- Burst Bombs",
    "- Splat Bombs",
    "- Suction Bombs",
    "- Seekers",
    "Players using Bomb Rush can still attack normally with their main weapon.",
    "- It is possible to continue bomb-throwing even after Bomb Rush has expired, but this will depletes the ink tank. Since secondary weapons consume large amounts of ink, pay extra attention to the status of Bomb Rush to avoid accidental depletion.\nThe special meter will deplete for the duration of Bomb Rush.\nAn Inkling's hair will glow and flutter while Bomb Rush is ready, and while Bomb Rush is active. This effect will cease once Bomb Rush has ended.",
    "- The allowed number of bomb throws depends on the amount of Special Duration Up, and on the type of bomb. An Inkling with no Special Duration Up may throw up to 10 Seekers, 11 Suction Bombs, 11 Splat Bombs, or 16 Burst Bombs before Bomb Rush expires. This count can be used to loosely estimate how much time is left on Bomb Rush.",
    "- Splat and Suction Bomb Rushes can be great for defending or retaking a Splat Zone, as they deal high damage and cover lots of ground. As of version 2.7.0, Seeker and Burst Bomb Rushes cover significant amounts of turf as well, although Burst Bombs deal less damage and Seekers need to be launched carefully to achieve maximum coverage (especially if they are \"distracted\" by enemy Inklings).",
    "- When using a Burst Bomb Rush, keep in mind that the throwing rate is increased by 50% for the duration of that special (20 frames delay instead of 30).",
    "In Octo Valley, the Bomb Rush is available for use in certain missions upon grabbing its canned special. The bomb type used matches the sub weapon that is currently selected by the player, and they have the appearance of the sub weapons as they appear in the Octo Valley mode instead of their multiplayer appearance.",
    "- Bomb Rush with Splat Bombs",
    "- Bomb Rush with Burst Bombs",
    "- Bomb Rush with Suction Bombs",
    "- Bomb Rush with Seekers",
    "- Octo Valley version of Bomb Rush with Splat Bombs.",
    "In Splatoon 2, as explained in Sunken Scroll 11, no special weapons from the first game return. The role of the Bomb Rush was indirectly replaced by the Bomb Launcher, in that they both fire a barrage of sub weapons, however the Bomb Launcher fires the weapons further and with greater accuracy, and is not dependent on the player's sub weapon.",
    "During the final battle of Octo Canyon, Callie uses a Bomb Rush to attack Agent 4, although now with oversized Splat Bombs and golden Suction Bombs. She does this whilst performing a remix of Bomb Rush Blush, a song presumably about the Bomb Rush special.",
    "- Splatoon is capable of using other sub weapons for the Bomb Rush, as demonstrated by @NWPlayer123 on Twitter with Disruptor Rush.[1]",
    "- The Carbon Roller Deco is the only weapon with the Seeker Rush.",
    "- Bomb Launcher"
