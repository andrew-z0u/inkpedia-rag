    "The InkzookaÂ is a special weapon in Splatoon.",
    "The Inkzooka has a tall, thin, cylindrical shape. Most of the Inkzooka is lime green, but it has dark green and red highlights, along with an ink tank at the back that changes color to match that of the user's ink. There is a lime green handle near the front as well as a dark green scope and trigger combination. The pillars that the Inkzooka shoots are similar in appearance to Rainmaker shots. However, they are much thinner with less stray ink around them and have a further reach.",
    "When the Inkzooka is activated, the user can shoot out large ink pillars for a roughly six-second time period.",
    "The Inkzooka has the second-longest range of any weapon in the game, only bested by the E-liter 3K weapons. The E-liters fire up to seven lines of distance in the test range when fully charged, while the Inkzooka reaches only about six and a half.",
    "- The Inkzooka is well-suited for taking out camping enemies, especially ones using chargers who often stay out of range of most weapons.",
    "- The projectile of the Inkzooka is the tip of the tornado. Therefore, if the tornado top hits an overhead obstruction, the whole pillar stops. A way to counter this is to aim downwards, thus decreasing the weapon's arc and avoiding overhead obstructions.",
    "- An easy way to avoid an Inkzooka is to simply stay out of the user's line of sight. While they can still use their sub weapon, using it wastes some of the Inkzooka's duration for shooting.",
    "- Without Special Duration Up, six shots can be fired from an Inkzooka. If an enemy activates it, listen for how many times they fire; if it reaches six, the coast is likely clear after that.\nAfter getting splatted by someone using or whose weapon kit has Inkzooka, take note of their main and sub abilities. Two Special Duration Up subs (6 ability points) will increase the shot total to seven, while one main and two subs (16 ability points) will increase it to eight.",

    "The Inkzooka does not return in Splatoon 2. However, a drawing of one appears on a Sunken Scroll explaining the absence of special weapons from Splatoon.",
    "- Sunken Scroll 11.",
    "The Inkzooka does not return in Splatoon 3, but the game does feature a direct successor to it, the Trizooka.",
    "- The Inkzooka was originally called the \"Ink Launcher\", as seen in an image from before Splatoon's release.",
    "- During the E3 2014 Splatoon demo, the Inkzooka was referred to as a \"Super Weapon\".[1]",
    "- The Inkzooka was the first playable special weapon, available during the E3 2014 demo.",
    "- The Inkzooka appears in more weapon sets than any other special weapon, at sixteen.",
    "- According to The Art of Splatoon, the Inkzooka utilizes the ink from Inklings who are in an intense emotional state.\nThis could also be true for all special weapons, due to players' tentacles glowing and their determined facial expressions.",
    "- There are icons in Super Mario Maker's files that contain multiple recolored variants of the inkzooka, one of those being the \"big laser\", which was presumably supposed to have a similar function to the Killer Wail.",
