  "content": "The Killer Wail is a special weapon in Splatoon.\n\nWhile the normal Killer Wail never appeared in Splatoon series sequels, variants with new or improved functionality have appeared. In Splatoon 2, a Killer Wail like weapon called the Princess Cannon appears. Splatoon 3 features the Killer Wail 5.1, a new special weapon which consists of six small Killer Wails.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Splatoon\n\n2.1 Use\n2.2 Version history\n2.3 Quotes\n2.4 Sets\n2.5 Gallery\n\n- 2.1 Use\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Sets\n\n- 2.5 Gallery\n\n- 3 Splatoon 2\n\n3.1 Princess Cannon\n\n- 3.1 Princess Cannon\n\n- 4 Splatoon 3\n\n4.1 Color Wail\n\n- 4.1 Color Wail\n\n- 5 Other appearances\n\n5.1 Super Smash Bros.

The megaphone itself is fairly standard aside from its large size. It is mainly dark gray with an even darker gray rim, and there is a warning label on the inside of the mouth of the horn speaker. The megaphone is attached to a dark gray box with a protruding cylinder on its left and its right. The ends of the cylinders change color to match the user's ink, and the end of the left cylinder has a sticker bearing the Custom logo on it. Behind the cylinders are four mufflers, two on the right side and two on the left. The two that are on the top face towards the user, while the two on the bottom face away from the user. All four of the mufflers are a purple-gray color with blue and pink stripes at the top. Behind the mufflers are two black handles that resemble the handles on a bicycle with hand brakes. The user's Inkling uses the handles to aim the Killer Wail. When the Killer Wail is fired, there is a brief period where a series of circles that change color to match the user's ink shoot out of it. Once the Killer Wail begins to fire, large sound waves that change color to match the user's ink begin to ripple out of it, and the mufflers begin spewing ink.\n\nWhen activated, the Killer Wail projects a series of concentric circles in its intended path for a moment before firing massive shockwaves in the user's ink color shortly after. They splat any enemies they touch, ignoring buildings or other obstacles. While the Killer Wail does not spread any ink of its own unless an opponent is splatted, it is useful for gaining or keeping control of the stage.\n\n- Use the Killer Wail through walls to surprise unsuspecting enemies that pass by.\n\n- It is advisable to activate the Killer Wail from around a corner as a surprise attack, to watch the enemy run into it and splat themselves.\n\n- It requires approximately two seconds to channel and activate the Killer Wail. Make sure it is activated early to get the hit.\n\n- Though the main use of the Killer Wail is to splat people, it is also excellent for chasing away enemies. Aim it at popular pathways, common sniping spots, Splat Zones, or Tower routes to essentially lock out enemies from these areas.\n\n- The Killer Wail is excellent against the Kraken or Bubbler because of its huge knockback. For instance, teammates sharing a Bubbler on top of the tower in Tower Control can all be pushed off with a well-aimed Killer Wail.\n\n- The Killer Wail is excellent to use at corridors where the enemy has a hard time to move aside. It is very strong on stages such as Walleye Warehouse, Port Mackerel and Camp Triggerfish.\n\n- The Killer Wail leaves a set of circles when it is about to activate. Watch out for them when they are visible and dodge it in squid form.\n\n- If an enemy has the Killer Wail as their special, take caution when walking around corners as they may silently channel it as a surprise.\n\n- The Killer Wail makes a loud guitar noise. This allows the player to know that someone is preparing an ambush. Use the noise to dodge it before retaliating.\n\n- Repeating the final boss level can help practice dodging the Killer Wail, as one of DJ Octavio's attacks uses a form similar to the Killer Wail.\n\n- ▲ Decreased the amount of turf needed to be inked for filling the Special Gauge: 180p → 160p\n\n- ▲ Shortened the period of decreased character control after using the Killer Wail when equipped with Special Duration Up.\n\n- — Changed how the Killer Wail's aiming prediction is displayed.\n\n- 3D art of a Killer Wail.\n\n- 3D art of a Killer Wail with blue ink.\n\n- A Killer Wail firing across the map.\n\n- Close-up of an activated Killer Wail.\n\n- Concept art of various weapons, with the Killer Wail in the middle.\n\nIn Splatoon 2, as explained in Sunken Scroll 11, no special weapons from the first game return. The role of the Killer Wail was indirectly replaced by the Sting Ray, in that they both shoot an extremely long beam that can pass through walls.\n\nDuring the final boss Turf War in the Octo Expansion, after the player has successfully completed the objective, Pearl uses a customized Killer Wail known as the Princess Cannon together with her battle cry to defeat the final boss.\n\nAfter its appearance in the Octo Expansion, the Princess Cannon returned during the Chaos vs. Order Splatfest as a special weapon that could be obtained and then used by any player at the center of MC.Princess Diaries one minute before the end of battle.\n\nSplatoon 3 features a special weapon similar to the Killer Wail called the Killer Wail 5.1, which fires multiple small beams instead.\n\nA weapon similar to the Princess Cannon and Killer Wail 5.1 appears in Side Order during the fight against Overlorder when reaching the top of the Spire of Order for the first time. After getting Full Spectrum by collecting all of the Spectrum color chips in the fourth phase, Agent 8's special weapon is replaced with a unique special that Pearl calls the Color Wail. This weapon deals 8888 damage per hit to the final boss.\n\nThe Inkling fighter in this game uses the Killer Wail as their Final Smash. Upon activation, the Killer Wail charges for a brief moment and then fires a powerful beam that paints enemies in the players color. While the beam is firing the player is able to attack and move freely and can angle the beam up and down by moving .\n\n- When launched, the Killer Wail emits a sound like a guitar chord that lasts for a few seconds.\n\n- A Killer Wail is used by the final boss of Octo Valley in the second phase and later. It is different in the boss battle. It takes longer to activate and is narrower than in multiplayer.\n\n- The Killer Wail is the only special weapon that is usable in some form in all three Splatoon games: as the Killer Wail in Splatoon, the Princess Cannon in Splatoon 2, and the Killer Wail 5.1 in Splatoon 3.\n\n- In the The Ursine Anomaly - #03 in Splatoon 3's single-player campaign Return of the Mammalians, one of Mr. Grizz's attacks is very similar to the Killer Wail.\n\n\"Killer Wail\" is derived from \"killer whale\" and \"wail\", the latter of which references its method of splatting opponents.\n\n- Sting Ray\n\n- Princess Cannon\n\n- Killer Wail 5.1"
