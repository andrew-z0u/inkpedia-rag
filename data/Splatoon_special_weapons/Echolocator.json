    "The Echolocator is a special weapon in Splatoon.",
    "Once activated, a digital explosion effect occurs around the user as they send black squid-shaped arrows flying to enemy players. Said arrows are black with highlights in the user's ink color. The tagged players are encircled by the aforementioned arrows and tied to members of the Echolocator user's team with a line of the user's ink color, although each line is only visible to the member it leads to.",
    "When activated, it marks all active opponents with black circling squids that can be seen through obstacles by the user's team.",
    "- Base marking duration is 9 seconds.\nThe duration can be extended with Special Duration Up.\nThe duration is reduced by 50% if the tagged opponent has Cold-Blooded.\nThe tag disappears if the opponent gets splatted and does not carry over to their next life.",
    "- The special gauge is emptied immediately upon use (instead of slowly depleting over time), allowing the user to refill it immediately after use.",
