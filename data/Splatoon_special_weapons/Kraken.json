However, the Kraken is much larger, with longer tentacles and a pointier head. The Kraken's eyes and the main part of its body change color to match that of the user's ink. The top of its head and the end of its tentacles, however, are yellow. When the Kraken jumps, swirls of ink come out of it.\n\nFor a short period of time, the player changes into a monster-like squid form. It can move freely on enemy ink while leaving its own trail. Jumping into an enemy splats them instantly and the user is immune to all damage. However, Krakens are affected much more by knockback, and can still be splatted by falling into water or out of bounds.\n\nSwim speed in Kraken form is the same as that of normal squid form. As such, its speed is affected by Swim Speed Up, Comeback, and Ninja Squid. However, Krakens are still fully visible even with Ninja Squid, so the only change is the speed reduction.[1]\n\n- When damaged or cornered, it is recommended to use Kraken as it grants invincibility from incoming attacks for a short time. Though it may not be the most strategically smart choice in a given situation, it would be better to use it to stay in the battle than to lose it by being splatted.\n\n- A Kraken can be used in a pinch to avoid being splatted by special weapons, such as an Inkstrike or Killer Wail.\n\n- Equipping Swim Speed Up can slightly increase the Kraken's speed, allowing the player to chase opponents more easily. Likewise, Ninja Squid slows down the Kraken's speed and does not provide any benefits, so stay away from that ability.\n\n- Like the Bubbler, the Kraken can be used in Tower Control to sit on the tower without taking damage. However, the increased knockback can make it difficult to stay on if enemies hit from the right angle.\n\n- Super Jumps can still be performed as a Kraken if there is a need to escape.\n\n- The activation of a Kraken makes a unique noise, alerting nearby players of its presence. If this sound is heard and no teammate has used their Kraken, it may be wise to leave the area or find a place to hide.\n\n- Speedy targets such as the Inkbrush can be fast enough to escape the Kraken.\n\n- Krakens' only method of spreading ink is with the small trail behind them, so they cannot cover a large area like normal players can. Because of this, hiding in one's own ink, no matter how small the puddle, may cause the Kraken to swim right by without even noticing as long as they did not see the player before they hid.\n\n- Since Krakens are considered \"squid forms\", they can still go through grates. Opposing players can try to lure the Kraken onto a grate, making them fall and breaking their pursuit.\n\n- Krakens are immune to damage, but can still be splatted by falling into water or out of bounds. This can be used to one's advantage in stages with either hazard, such as Mahi-Mahi Resort.\nIn Arowana Mall, there is a grate above the water. Try luring them into falling through the grate and into the water, where they will splat themselves in the process.\n\n- In Arowana Mall, there is a grate above the water. Try luring them into falling through the grate and into the water, where they will splat themselves in the process.\n\n- Krakens are very vulnerable to knockback, which can be used to keep them out of melee range. Very fast weapons, such as the Aerosprays and Inkbrush, can even allow the user to simply stand in front of the Kraken and just keep shooting (or flicking) at it to keep it away, provided they have enough ink.\n\n- After coming out of Kraken form, there is a moment in which the player cannot use any weapons. This can be taken advantage for an easy splat if one is quick enough.\n\n- In Arowana Mall, there is a grate above the water. Try luring them into falling through the grate and into the water, where they will splat themselves in the process.\n\n- ▼ The Kraken can now be pushed back by firing directly at it to add counter play towards it.\n\n- ▼ Increased the amount of turf needed to be inked for filling the Special Gauge: 180p → 200p\n\n- ▼ Added a period of 0.75 seconds before players can attack again after using Kraken.\n\n- ▼ Increased the area that Kraken takes damage according to the size of its body.\n\n- ▼ Increased the amount of knockback when Kraken users are hit from above or below.\n\n- ▼ Base duration: 6 seconds → 5 seconds\n\n- ▲ Maximum extra duration added by Special Duration Up: 40% → 60%\n\n- Kraken 3D art.\n\n- Kraken 3D art.\n\n- A Kraken swimming.\n\n- A Kraken jumping.\n\n- The underside of a Kraken.\n\n- The Kraken Super Jumping.\n\n- Rival Octolings modded to use Kraken. Note the curled tentacles.\n\n- The icon for any challenge using the Kraken.\n\n- Illustration of the Inkling Squid amiibo's Kraken functionality\n\nIn Splatoon 2, as explained in Sunken Scroll 11, no special weapons from the first game return. The role of the Kraken was indirectly replaced by the Baller, in that they both deal contact damage and leave a trail of ink in their path. However, the Baller deals much less contact damage, explodes after the timer runs out or directly by the player, and can be destroyed.\n\nSplatoon 3 features Kraken Royale, a direct successor of Kraken from Splatoon, though it appears lighter in color and can now use a charge attack.\n\n- The early name of the Kraken was \"King Squid\" as was found within the files of an early version of Super Mario Maker.\n\n- If modded to use Kraken, rival Octolings curl their tentacles like their normal octopus form.\n\n- While the average Inkling squid form has gray eyes, Krakens' eyes are the player's ink color.\n\nA kraken is a mythological sea monster and the subject of superstition and myths of many sailors. Although there are discrepancies, the legend of the kraken may date back to sightings of giant squid."
