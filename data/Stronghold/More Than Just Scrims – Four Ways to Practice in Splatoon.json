  "content": "Practice sessions are a necessity for any team or player, but the high frequency that practices are held mean that they’re subject to growing stale quickly. The same thing over and over again might prevent teammates from growing where they need to. Doing something different might shine light on something new that needs to be worked on!\n\nSo let’s talk about a handful of different practice formats that you can implement into your team’s sessions to stay fresh!\n\n## Scrims\n\nScrims (short for “scrimmages”) are the most common Splatoon practice format. Two teams will set a time to meet, where they will spend the practice playing match after match. These are set up as Private Battles in a 4-vs-4 format, on any map or mode.\n\nIt is usually advised that when planning a scrim, that you try to play against a team that is a bit more skilled than your team. This will give your team opportunities to have their mistakes punished so they can learn better habits and get stronger. Another scrim preference is against a team that has a composition that you know your team struggles against–maybe your team consistently breaks apart against a dive composition, so you would search for a team to scrim against that employs dive tactics.\n\n### Scrims with Coaches Mixed In\n\nTeams that have coaches may occasionally see their coach substitute on their team in some practices. The purpose is not to give the team a stronger chance of winning, but for the coach to show their team how to do something. Examples like proper callouts, map positioning, when to push forward and when to retreat, or to apply pressure to their team’s known weaknesses are all things that a coach may want to highlight.\n\n## 8s\n\nThe idea behind 8s practices in Splatoon is not new, but it has been recently revived (especially among top-level players) as a way to keep scrims feeling fresher and alleviate scheduling conflicts. Sometimes it’s easier to pull together eight individual players for a few hours than finding two established teams whose schedules align.\n\n8s differ from normal scrims in that it’s still a 4-vs-4 format in whichever map/mode everyone decides on, but the players are typically not from the same team. Instead, 8s are made up of a pool of eight players. While there isn’t a requirement for who is in the pool, the NA scene in particular tries to keep the lobby looking like this:\n\nTwo players with Tacticooler special weapons\n\nTwo players who play support weapons\n\nFour players who play aggro weapons (slayers or skirmishers)\n\nThe Tacticooler players will always be on different teams. The support players will also always be on different teams, but can switch which Tacticooler player they are on a team with. The other four players will be split up and put on a team with a Tacticooler player and a support player, for a team composed of one Tacticooler player, one support player, and two aggro players.\n\nThese teams will play a few matches against one another, and then shuffle around the players, making sure that there is only one Tacticooler player and one support player per team. This process will repeat until the session is over. 8s can be a worthwhile way to find new compositions that you feel like you can excel in, or practice against weapons that you struggle against–the pool is highly customizable and fluid!\n\n## Drills\n\nDrills are not like scrims or 8s where the team is facing another team, and might not even involve playing game modes against others. A team who knows where they struggle has already taken the first step to improvement, and the next step is to act on that. Drills are the vehicle for that step, taking the form of intentional, repetitive action on one focus area.\n\nDrills are very helpful for working on things that are difficult to implement in maps consistently. Techniques like sub-strafing/main-strafing and squid rolls/squid surges can be far more effective to practice in drills so players can build up their muscle memory, ending up more likely to use them in real matches.\n\nAim drills are also very common. While this is usually thought of as a solo task, teams can come together to further enhance the practice. Teammates moving on a map to emulate real gameplay scenarios can be far more beneficial to learning how to aim at moving targets and where the best places to position are. Additionally, in real maps, there aren’t many chances to use a special, so drills are the best place to practice aim and utility for specials that require precision and technique, such as Trizooka, Ultra Stamp, and Zipcaster.\n\n## VoD Review\n\nNever underestimate how much impact VoD reviewing can have! Players who feel like they’ve hit a skill cap or don’t know what to practice next have the most to gain from looking at replays and talking to others about where they can improve next. Looking at replays from other players is also a valuable way to see how more skilled players react to scenarios and where they position on a map.\n\nA practice session doesn’t have to involve only playing the game and practicing maps and modes and weapons in Splatoon. Sometimes, and especially for new teams, what is important about a practice is that everyone is interacting and building rapport. Players who don’t get along threaten the stability of a team and make the experience worse for everybody. Tunnel-visioning on only one thing is also a key ingredient to burn out. So if your team wants to have a relaxed session and do something else every once in a while, encourage it! Keep your practice sessions diverse so there’s always something new to look forward to!\n\nThis article was written and formatted for publication by YELLOW .\n\nArticle first published: June 18, 2025"
