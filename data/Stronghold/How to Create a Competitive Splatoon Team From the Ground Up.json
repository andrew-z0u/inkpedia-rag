  "paragraphs": [
    "Preface; this guide is meant to help those formingcompetitive, organized teamswith the goal of practicing regularly and striving to improve at the funny squid game. If you are looking for a guide to help you get your feet wet, or looking to join a team vs creating one, this may not be the guide for you, although I expect at least some of the knowledge I have to impart will be helpful to everyone to some degree, so take what you will.",

    "For those who don’t know me, hi, I’m Alphine! I’m the current team captain ofFlour Egg Panko,and have been the team manager for 2 Stronghold Beginners Academy (SBA) teams (Unidentified.ink and Blossom Dance, SBA seasons 1 and 2, respectively). In addition, I recently helped formInkmaxxingas a personal favor to a friend, and remain the team's “advisor” (similar to a team manager role, but more hands off - I simply give them advice if I see them going in a direction that is not ideal for them). I am a long time captain with a LOT of experience, and I am making this guide with the hope that the struggles I faced with my first 3 teams will be avoided by the up-and-coming teams being formed every day by newer players in the same situation I was in 2 years ago, having no idea what to do or where to start.",
    "At the very basic level, you should start by going tosendou.inkand make an account - the only other thing you need is a Discord account, which you already should have. Everything you could possibly want is on this site; from planners, to weapon builds, to a tab to find scrims, and this site will be the crux of your competitive journey. Make sure the first thing you do after you create an account is fill your profile out a little bit (add your in-game name, as most low level events require Splashtag verification, add your weapon pool, any fun facts about yourself, etc.) because blank profiles with no/few results will be red flags to your tryouts! You want to show anyone who glances at your profile that you at least have a little bit of an idea of what you’re doing.",
    "After getting acquainted with sendou.ink, you will want to check outhttps://www.splatoonstronghold.com/resources, as they have a list of community Discord servers to join. Of particular interest to the purpose of this guide is the “Recruitment and Free Agency Server”, which, as you can guess, is where a majority of recruitment for teams takes place. I would also recommend joining theSplatoon Stronghold,Inkling Performance Labs, andUnder PressureDiscord servers. There are way, way more servers out there (at the time of writing this I am in 50+ Discord servers explicitly geared towards competitive play), but for newer/budding players, those are the 4 main servers I’d recommend that essentially everyone join at the start.These servers will provide you with the widest range of networking/resources to work with.",
    "To make this guide more legible, I will outline the steps of forming your team in sections, in order of how you should go about it - feel free to adjust or change the process to your liking, although your mileage will vary if you deviate too heavily! (Please don’t do tryouts by doing a single play session of Anarchy Open or Turf War, for example). Once again, this guide is primarily focused on the process ofcreating a team from scratch, from the captain’s POV, but if you are looking toJOINan existing team instead, or looking for something more casual/laid back compared to what the idea of a “competitive” team implies, just know that the process from your perspective will be nearly identical, and you should be looking out for similar red flags that I will outline below.",
    "A. What do YOU want out of your team?",
    "To start, ask yourself the following questions:",
    "What do I want to accomplish as an individual player?",
    "What weapons do I currently desire to play?",
    "What type of person do I want to play with?",
    "(From my experience, age/maturity/availability are the big 3 pressure points that make or break things).",
    "Based on your own answers to these questions, write up a short synopsis of your team, following this template:",
    "Team Name:",
    "Timezone:",
    "Skill Level:",
    "Availability:",
    "Requirements:",
    "Min/Max Age:",
    "Once you have done that, copy and paste it into Discord servers with team post channels. (The recruitment server, as mentioned earlier, is the primary place to go for this, although most competitive servers will also have dedicated channels as well.) The next step is to wait for people to DM you, or for you to find people in Free Agent (FA) channels and DM those who are looking for a team to join vs creating one on their own. In the meantime, there are some extra things you should do before you start doing tryouts.",
    "B. Creating the Grassroots",
    "After you have a rough idea of what you want to do and have a team listing up, the next step is to create the interface you will use to talk to your tryouts - the easiest way to do this is to create a Discord server. You don’t need anything more than the basic 1 text channel, 1 voice channel setup that every Discord server starts with. I would recommend adding a separate category and team role with a separate team chat, especially if you ever want to invite other teams into your server.",
    "Scroll to the bottom of your server list, click or tap on “Add a server” → “Create my own” and then go from there.",
    "To create a team-specific category, first create a role (ideally named the same as the team name) and then a separate category (hold right click on desktop; tap and hold on mobile → new category). Then create a text channel in that category, followed by going to the settings of the channel and or category and turning “view channel” for @everyone to “off” while changing the “view messages” permission of the team role you created earlier to “yes” (the green check mark).",
    "Once you have a Discord server set up, you’re ready to move onto the next step - actually recruiting people!",
    "C. Tryouts",
    "There are many different schools of discipline about how to manage and do tryouts, so for this section, I will simply outline my own process. Feel free to take what you like and remove what you don’t - however, I personally feel this is the best possible approach and will leave any group with the highest chance of staying together long term (2-3 years or more), so I recommend not deviating too heavily from this outline.",
    "The first step towards tryouts is to respond to anyone who has DMed you as a response to your team post. Ideally they gave you their FA information in their first message, but if not, start by asking for it.",
    "While you wait for them to respond, do the following:",
    "Check any of their linked socials for misbehavior (Twitter/Bluesky/Twitch/YouTube/etc.)",
    "Ask around to see if they are known for misbehavior, if possible",
    "Check their sendou.ink page for any info they did not mention (if they are on any other teams, what weapons they play, etc.)",
    "You want to make sure you root out bad actors, especially known bad actors, before they even get an inch towards your team - it is not as easy as it sounds, unfortunately, but good pre-tryout background checks will also weed out people who have incompatible goals compared to your own, which is a nice side bonus.",
    "After they have responded to you, and if you feel comfortable moving forward, invite them to the Discord server you made in step B, and start arranging a practice of some kind. This should ideally be a scrim (a form of practice where you get 2 separate teams into a private battle to mock battle with no stakes - the process of scrimming itself is worth its own guide IMO), and the goal is to see how they do in a typical team practice scenario.",
    "If you need to get more people to do a scrim, don’t be afraid to ping for pickups (a method of temporarily playing with other players, typically for one session or tournament) in community servers. Make sure that it is clear that you are doing a scrim for a team tryout in your message. If you can, try to spend some casual time with your tryouts in a voice chat beforehand, and do some icebreakers before the scrim to get everyone knowing each other better. Basic questions like “what is your name?”, “what weapons do you play?”, “what interests do you have besides Splatoon”? are great icebreakers, from my experience.",
    "What I like to do, personally, is tryout a single person at a time for about 2-3 weeks, or up to a month if necessary. If possible, try to scrim someone well above your league at least once during this process (if you are new to competitive, find a From the Ink Up (FTIU) banned team who is willing to scrim you), just to see how your tryout handles losing every game. I find this is an easy way to weed out people who struggle to mentally self-regulate healthily and are hard to work with because of that.",
    "Common red flags to look out for in a teammate that will not be a good team player are going from talkative to dead silent, or if they start blaming others for the losses without any time spent reviewing. You want to spend as much time as possible with one person each, and learn for sure if they are compatible with your own vision and drive for the game. The ultimate goal is to have a group of people that you will be hanging out with for 10-15+ hours a week, so effective weeding out and screening is paramount to creating a healthy team.",
    "If you have to, doing Anarchy Open or SendouQ are okay alternatives to a scrim, but always be wary of the first impression you get out of a tryout, making sure to throw them through the wringer until you are 100% confident that they are someone you WANT to play with. When you are ready to finalize a roster addition, DM the player you want to add, offering them a spot on the team - if they accept, tell them congrats! Make sure to give them access to the private team category you made earlier, if applicable, and if you have not yet, set up asendou.ink team page, and add them to the roster on the team page. Repeat the process above as many times as you need to form a complete team - given that you need at least 4 players to participate in most activities, the baseline here is 3 times minimum, but you may want to consider an additional 5th or even 6th (although I would strongly recommend against more then 5 players on a team) player if your own availability may not be ideal.",
    "One important thing to stress: as soon as your team goes from 1 player to 2 players, start allowing your teammates to add their own input where needed. Every decision made as a team should be unanimous and honest. An easy red flag from a player’s POV is a team captain who does not listen to their teammates and ignores criticism, to the detriment of the entire team. You want EVERYONE to mutually share the same vision and goals, not just the first 2 people who join.",
    "Some questions I like to ask tryouts before or after a scrim, to weed out potential issues:",
    "What do you want to accomplish as a player?",
    "What do you want to accomplish as a team?",
    "How much time do you want to spend per week on this team?",
    "Red flags to watch out for in your tryout are their answer to question 1 being too vague/not well thought out (“I want to win Low Ink” is particularly common and a sign that they don’t know the gravity of the statement), or if their answer to question 2 is not different from question 1 (the goal is to get them thinking about how they envision themselves as a unit, not just as a solo player).",
    "You should shoot for 2-3 scrims and an icebreaker session, ideally spending as much time as possible to get to know your tryout. See if you have any additional hobbies or mutual interests besides Splatoon to bond over. The more you know, the better.",
    "Some major things to avoid:",
    "Do not tryout multiple people in the same scrim.",
    "Ensure tryouts are not banned from sendou.ink or any other major organization.",
    "Do not take people with conflicting goals/motivations (if one person wants to play with Tacticooler and another doesn’t, that will cause long term conflict).",
    "Do not create major skill gaps (ex. if you are new to competitive, do not take someone who is Low Ink banned)",
    "D. Finalizing Roster and What to Do Afterwards",
    "Once you have repeated step C the desired amount of times, congrats! You’ve done well to make it this far! Now, of course, your job isn’t done yet.",
    "To keep it very brief, the scene is large, and there are a ton of events to do and people to talk to when you're just starting out. From your Low Inks to your From the Ink Ups, there's also smaller tournaments like World 9, Reach, Setting Sail, and more, all of which can be found on sendou.ink's calendar tab. Registration is typically handled through sendou.ink, so if you set up a team page earlier, you're already ready to play.",
    "Something I have glossed over in this guide are the traits that a good captain should have. Put simply, as the captain of your newly formed team, these should be your primary responsibilities (keeping in mind that you can and should delegate at least some of these to your teammates):",
    "Arrange practices and sign-up for events.",
    "Ensure everyone is present for practices/events/reviews and hold people accountable.",
    "Keep everyone on the same page, hold regular meetings and try to connect with your teammates on a personal level.",
    "Every team will want to play a different amount, but I find the balance that works for most teams is 1 scrim → 1 VoD review (review games from the previous scrim and see what could be done better) → 1 tournament per week, while adjusting as necessary based on your team's own needs and schedules.",
    "Something I have found personal success with as captain of Flour Egg Panko is making a weekly Discord thread and a schej/when2meet, which allows us to schedule a week in advance, even accounting for last minute changes in plans or off weeks where nobody is available. In addition, holding regular checkup meetings is something I find extremely helpful, since a common reason teams disband early on is peoples’ motivations/life situations changing to such a degree that their current team no longer works for them.",
    "When holding a meeting, you don’t have to make it super formal; frame it as a quick get-together to sort issues out that may not be appropriate during practice time. A common thing to ask is, “have our goals changed since the last time we checked up, and if so, what are they?” With any luck, you should have a fully functioning, well-managed team, and hopefully everyone becomes fast friends while having fun playing Splatoon at the same time!",
