  "content": "Though most competitive players join the scene with the intention of just playing, there are some who end up working to contribute to the scene while playing, or just contributing full-time. This is done through a number of means, including creating content as this helps to promote the scene for those who haven’t come across it yet. In the segment below, this guide will give you a starting point for how to start contributing to the competitive Splatoon scene.\n\n## Content Creation\n\nCreating content for platforms such as YouTube and Twitch are great ways to build a following and gain more recognition in the scene. Even simply streaming/uploading your scrimmages or tournament sets count as “content creation”. If you’re planning to get serious about it, there are some things you’ll want to be aware of. Just remember, don’t focus on entering into content creation as a full-time job, it rarely ever works that way. It’s better to have a regular job / focus on school and create content on the side.\n\nFirst off is branding, you’ll want to have the same name, profile photo, and relatively similar social media handles so you’ll be recognizable and easy to find. Secondly, figure out what it is you’ll want to focus on with your content. Do you want to make guides for other players? Post commentary on various games? Or even just upload footage of your scrims and tournament sets? All of these are good starting points; you could even do a combination of all three. Lastly, remember that consistency is key. Frequently uploading/streaming will help your channel to grow steadily. Make sure to not focus on the quantity of the content, remember to focus on the quality of it.\n\nIf you’re interested in learning more about how to get into content creation in general, there are plenty of videos and guides online providing useful information on how to get started. Below is a video made by ThatSrb2DUDE, one of the biggest Splatoon content creator, sharing his story of how he became a content creator Splatoon.\n\nHow I Became a Splatoon Creator\n\n## Coaching\n\nIt’s very common for teams or even individual players to look for a player that is above their skill level to coach them in their gameplay to help them improve. Simply telling people what they did wrong and what they should be doing is not enough to count as “proper coaching”. You need to explain the why as well to help a player to truly learn what they need to do differently so they can apply it to other situations.\n\nBelow is a guide written jointly by Dr. Prodigy and FLC, two well-known, high-level Splatoon coaches. Note, even though this guide was written for Splatoon 2, it can be applied to the other games as well.\n\nA Guide to Coaching in Splatoon\n\n## Tournament Organizing\n\nThis is where you help to host and run tournaments for other players to participate and compete in. Tournaments are the climax of the scene that everyone is working toward throwing on a good performance whether it be good gameplay, a well-run tournament, or an eye-catching stream.\n\nBelow is a guide written by Ink.Jordan that aims to help new tournament organizers get started in running tournaments.\n\nA Rookie’s Guide to Tournament Organizing\n\n## Commentating\n\nThe exciting commentary heard during tournament streams are from players that have set aside time to learn how to commentate tournament sets between opposing teams.
