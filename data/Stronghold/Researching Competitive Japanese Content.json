  "content": "## Introduction\n\n### Why the JP scene is a good reference\n\nNintendo is a company based in Japan, so its first consumer market is in that country. With that being said, there is a much larger audience for Splatoon there with a greater concentration compared to the rest of the competitive Splatoon scene. With players in Japan being closer geographically and culturally, they are able to find practice consistently (time zones are not an issue) and have the same expectations of each other (culture really values things such as timeliness and respect). Lag/latency is rarely an issue due to Japanese players all living in close proximity to each other. This is not even mentioning the lack of a language barrier.\n\nConsidering all of these factors, the competitive Splatoon community in Japan has grown massively and they are able to coordinate many practices efficiently, increasing the average skill level among competitive players there. This is why, compared to the Western scene, the competitive scene in Japan is a great reference point to look at for tips, tricks, strategies, and other gameplay information.\n\n### What this guide will enable you to do\n\nThis guide will show you how to find information in the JP scene related to what you want to learn more about. It can be difficult to find some information in mainstream competitive channels that are in English, because it is usually either barely known or doesn’t exist at all. Hopefully this guide will help you out in your search for higher level information.\n\n## How to research\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, we’ll be using a single example and going through a step-by-step process on how to find out more about this example of information. This process can be applied to any other piece of information you want to find.\n\n### 1. Create a title for your info.\n\nFigure out what information you’re gonna look for. For this guide, we’re going to be looking for some high-level Heavy Splatling gameplay in X Battle. We’ll craft a sample title of “2700XP Heavy Splatling X Battle”.\n\nIf we were to type this into YouTube or Google, we’d find a number of results, but they’d be from English-speaking players. We have to translate it first.\n\nTitle: “2700XP Heavy Splatling X Battle”\n\n### 2. Translate your title.\n\nUsing a variety of translation tools (see Translation Tools), we can translate our title.\n\nThe 2700XP part can stay as is since numbers carry over between English to Japanese. For the Heavy Splatling, we’ll need to consult Inkipedia. Typing in Heavy Splatling to find the wiki page for it, scrolling down to the bottom we can see the direct translation for it.\n\nThis part is important since if we were to directly translate Heavy Splatling to Japanese, we’d get 激しい飛び散り, when the correct Japanese translation is バレルスピナー. This is because when translating the localized Japanese translation to English, the English result is “barrel spinner”. Keep this in mind as we translate things.\n\nRepeat the same process for X Battle.\n\nTranslation: “2700XP バレルスピナー Xマッチ”\n\n### 3. Search with your translation.\n\nNow that you have a title that has been translated to Japanese, you can search the internet with it! If you’re trying to find gameplay as in our case, we can use either Google or YouTube.\n\nUpon searching with our translated title…\n\nGoogle:\n\nYouTube:\n\nAnd we got Japanese results with nearly exactly what we wanted! If you’re looking for gameplay, it is typically better to use only YouTube or OpenRec (a Japanese recording website, basically like YouTube), however, if you’re looking for more general results, Google will generate better results.\n\n### 4. Need to translate results?\n\nIf you think you’ve found what you needed, but you have no clue because you have a page like this, then don’t worry, that’s what this step will cover.\n\nInstalling a translator browser extension can allow you to translate the entire web page like this.\n\nIf there are some strange words, such as “Bubki” here, this is where we can consult other tools such as Inkipedia to find out what that translates to in English.\n\nChecking with Inkipedia…\n\nUnfortunate! This does happen sometimes, but if we look at the context of this word within the page, we can safely assume it to mean something like “weapon”. If we look at one of the navigation links on the left titled “Bunkara match”, we can try again to see if anything turns up.\n\nBingo! Upon further investigation, this word is mentioned in an Inkipedia staff discussion, and we can infer that it refers to a general region in the Splatlands.\n\nIn conclusion, there’s a number of methods available that we can use to find Japanese information for Splatoon and then translate those results so we can learn new things and further our understanding of the game thanks to the work of overseas players.\n\n## Translation Tools\n\n### Google Translate\n\nWell, it is Google Translate, nearly everyone is aware of this tool.\n\n### DeepL\n\nWhile DeepL is a lesser known translation tool, those who are aware of it know it to be a generally more accurate translation tool compared to others like Google Translate.\n\n### Inkipedia\n\nIf you scroll down to the bottom of nearly any page, there’ll be a section titled “Names in other languages”. Here you can find what the translation of that particular item is. Here is an example for Splattershot:\n\nIf a translation ever returns a strange word that you may not understand what it means, you can refer to Inkipedia. One example of this is for the word Splatling, which when translated from Japanese to English is “spinner”. To continue with that example, when translating バレルスピナー to English, the result is “Barrel Spinner”. Upon typing “Barrel Spinner” into Inkipedia, the following results suggest it’s a Heavy Splatling.\n\nCombining tools is a very powerful way to translate Japanese information into a language you’re familiar with.\n\n## Others\n\nSimply looking up “best japanese translators” on Google or any other search engine will bring up a number of Japanese translators that can be used."
