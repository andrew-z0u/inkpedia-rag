  "title": "Analyzing A Weapon’s Viability",
  "paragraphs": [
    "Introduction",
    "Splatoon is an extremely complex game. There’s a lot of moving parts due to the way the game’s kits are composed leading to questions about how a said kit interacts not only within itself, but also the surrounding environment, be it different maps, modes and mainly, the current and both past/future metas.In this excerpt, I intend on going through what I consider to be the 3 essential steps in judging any weapon kit’s viability. I would like to lead with a few prefaces:",
    "This article will mainly focus on a Splat Zones environment, however I believe this transfers to other modes perfectly, just with different considerations, given the non objective specific criteria I apply to each stage.",
    "Specific Map Mode niches (e.g Octobrush Nouveau on Flounder Heights Zones) will NOT be covered within this article, because although important, it is better covered on a case by case basis, whilst I intend to offer a coverage of a weapon’s viability on an entire environment instead of only in specific niches. I’d like to preface however this may be a topic I approach in the future.",
    "First I’d like to outline the 3 stages I’ve defined, and decompose them in complexity’s order. In my opinion, the best learning experience is led through examples, and as such we will be analyzing a weapon through each stage in order to determine this weapon’s viability.",
    "As to ensure the fidelity of my information as much as possible, the weapon I will choose will be the Splat Brella (vanilla kit), as it has been, alongside the H-3 Nozzlenose my preferred weapon for 6+ years, and as such one I believe to have sufficient experience with.",
    "Stage 1: The Weapon Kit",
    "This is the first and easiest way to start, and unfortunately where most players stop their introspective which I hope to show why this is insufficient. This mainly focuses on 2 critical aspects: The strength of each individual component (Main, Sub, Special) and the intrinsic synergy between them. Let’s look at our Splat Brella.",
    "Main Weapon",
    "The Splat Brella is a solid main weapon, which specializes in absorbing pressure in order to allow its team more freedom in taking advantageous fights, and also plays a key role in area denial for the enemy team. It has solid paint, and is decently self sufficient once set up. It struggles with downtime and a difficulty in using sub-weapons, lacks ways to deal with longer ranged weapons such as Chargers and AOE weapons, and struggles to enter into contested space. Balance wise, I believe it to be a good weapon leaning towards the upper end of weapons overall.",
    "Sub Weapon",
    "Sprinkler is overall a underwhelming sub for most weapons, only specializing in quickly painting under yourself for weapons with long endlag such as S-Blast, or as a passive way to keep paint control over a contested area in some safe locations (e.g, Hagglefish’s sides), which requires you to stay alive. It also has the use of contesting rainmaker pops, or camping opposing Super Jumps but these are minor. Synergy wise, Brella has had Sprinkler before in Splatoon 2 and I believe it to be pretty good, about the same level as Autobomb. Brella struggles to use sub weapons in fights, so deployables are generally favoured, and although it would really appreciate a way to deal with opposing Splash Walls, the “put it somewhere good and forget about it” way of using Sprinkler keeps it being useful while not being a drain on Brella’s ability to fight. Brella does not have enough gear freedom to invest in its sub weapon, so sprinkler not requiring any Saver / Power Up to function is appreciated.",
    "Special Weapon",
    "Strikes are the main point of contention within this kit. I believe this to be one of the strongest stand alone specials it has gotten balance wise, whilst also being the one with the lowest synergy. Strikes contribute to augment Brella’s decent paint, and their spammability combined with Sprinkler means you can get a high amount of them (especially with charge up included). Strikes also fix one of Brella’s main issues which is difficulty entering contested areas, as you can use it to move defenders out of position, letting you and your team enter the space, which Brella can then afterwards play to its strength of keeping.",
    "However this comes with many downsides. Strikes have next to 0 use midfight, which really hurts Brella’s uptime, since you cannot get a kill, and use a low commitment special such as Ink Storm or Bomb Rush that it previously had to refill your tank and keep fighting. Even Inkjet, while dangerous, can sometimes buy you a few extra seconds which might just be what your team needs to catch up to you, although generally Inkjet is also not the best at keeping you alive after a kill due to losing the ability to shield and the increase in hitbox. Strikes also have a very low duration effect. It’s hard to utilize a strike’s damage effect for yourself, unlike Storm since by the time you arrive at the contested location, the strikes are already going off or already have gone off. This is minor but also worth talking about, but strikes have very low solo play making potential, so you are very reliant on your team to act on the strikes as well.",
    "An overall look at the kit, has shown us that while some of the individual kit pieces are strong, the kit is overall weaker synergy wise when compared to all previous Brella kits, and the brand new Sorella Brella kit, and as such, weaker generally than its counterparts in a vacuum. However, we have left a few crucial details out of this evaluation, which we will now dive into in our next 2 stages which could alter the perceived viability of any weapon.",
    "Stage 2: The Meta",
    "This could be argued to be the most important step in any analysis, which is taking the previously laid out idea and panning it out in the overall environment and context of the current game. A weapon could be overall weaker than its alternatives but manage to fit a niche that could be more valuable than the generalist abstract power level of other options (for example, Neo Splash while being a weaker generalist kit than Tentatek Splattershot, it’s weaknesses are much less relevant and it’s strengths much more appreciated in the context of the tasks that it has to fill out in a team comp).",
    "This is especially significant since it doesn’t matter as much how good a certain weapon kit is, if the meta is very strongly against it. To take an exaggerated example, it wouldn’t matter if Roller was a significant sharking threat that was significantly overtuned, if the other best weapons in the game consisted of weapons with Point Sensors, Tenta Missiles, Wave Breakers etc. This can also be applied into a reverse logic, such as an anti meta weapon being picked because it fills a specific purpose, and does it very well (for example, Jr’s rise as an overall weak weapon, however filling a perfect role in dive as dealing with a lot of dive’s counters).Let’s apply this to our little Splat Brella. Currently the meta is quite fighting heavy and very skirmishing oriented, which is where Brella usually thrives in due to its ability to draw out long fights, and due to pair up with teammates so the main weapon is in a good spot, it enjoys having cooler since it lets it invest a bit into charge up or main saver, and it has a good matchup into some of the top weapons, such as Splash, Dualies, Dualie Squelchers, Edit, Squeezer etc. It does have a few matchups that it struggles with quite heavily, namely Blasters, Decavitator and Slosher in some maps.",
    "Now, since the main weapon seems to be in a good spot let’s look at the kit. Compared to the Sorella Brella, this kit, while being much less synergistic, is much more well adapted to mitigating a lot of the strong parts of the meta, and softening bad matchups. Tri strikes are a great special right now, and they do help Splat Brella with a lot of what it struggles with, such as dealing with Big Bubblers from weapons like Decavitator and Roller, making an opening for your team by displacing anchor weapons such as Pencil, and opens up a reliable special that can be farmed quite consistently when going against weapons such as Range Blaster (one of the main problems of the Sorella Brella, is that it’s too reliant on fighting, even in bad matchups, and most weapons that have a good matchup into Brella, have a good one into Inkjet too, so both the main weapon and the special do not feel useful in certain matches). This allows Splat Brella to fill in a more supportive frontline role, as a weapon that is great at holding space, and enables its teammates to move forward by contributing with a reliable entry tool.",
    "It is worth noting that Inkjet can have a higher potential to contribute heavily to a match, however it is inherently both inconsistent as it is based on the map mode combo, the enemy team composition and your own performance, and it can very much be a better pick than Strikes in most matches.",
    "Strikes being reliable and strong power wise as a generalist special, should not write off the fact that Inkjet has a lot of situational power, and the best Brella players should know when to swap around their kit, and that despite Sorella Brella being the most intrinsically synergistic and therefore “stronger feeling” kit, the Vanilla Brella presents a similar role with different utility. It is this type of observation, not of overall strength, but judging of the game’s environment, that this stage of analysis is founded upon.",
    "By the end of this stage, we can recognize that what appeared at first to be a kit that should be discarded when compared to the Sorella Brella, due to having the same similar main weapon with a theoretically stronger kit, actually does present a good deal of situations where it can be of use, as it presents a playstyle and special that are much better suited for the current meta, giving it solid use cases.",
    "Stage 3: Your friends!",
    "This stage sadly exists due to the limitations within the kits in the game but is important nonetheless: finding a satisfying team comp for the weapon.",
    "There’s a lot of weapons that fit both criteria above, and don’t find a place in most teams due to a lack of options to make them function. One prominent example right now, would be Squeezer, which is still an amazing weapon, that features both absurd strengths and a great matchup into most weapons in the meta, but struggles to get picked due to being extremely difficult to slot into a team without bringing serious issues into it, when compared to weapons of a similar role such as Stamper or Slosher.",
    "Brella’s favorite team styles are dive, so let’s see if it brings sufficient synergy into these comps to actually fit in.",
    "Imagining a standard dive comp, we could have something like: Heavy, Zap, Stamper, Dualies. You can switch a few gears around, like Decavitator and Stamper, or Tetras and Dualies, etc but let’s go with this. In here, the Brella could easily swap with either the Stamper or Dualies, being a core part of the frontline duo that characterizes dive comps, due to it being able to fulfill a similar role, of keeping aggression, providing a strong entry special, stalling fights and having great combo numbers with both weapons. In addition to this, Brella has amazing synergy with all the weapons in this comp. With dualies, strikes provides a way for it to get in vs midrange, allows it to shark and provides a way to set up crab. In return, dualies provide a very strong and quick engage, very little downtime and amazing mobility to follow up on shield stalling, and Crab is the best tool to allow Brella to take a space, so it can then hold it. Stamper is amazing aswell, as its 35 damage and burst bomb allow Brella to one shot, it can help with matchups such as Slosher and Blaster, and Zipcaster is another great entry tool for Brella. In return, Brella provides good paint, 32 damage with only 2 pellets (enough to combo with a vertical) and strikes to move backlines before a Zipcaster. In addition to this, both Heavy and Zap appreciate having a Brella on their team that allows them to play more aggressive, since the Brella absorbs a lot of pressure the enemy team could direct at these teammates, allowing easy crossfire opportunities to both weapons.",
    "So taking this into account, we can see that Splat Brella would not only fit into strong team comps quite practically, it offers both amazing synergy, and different utility from other weapons.",
    "Conclusion",
    "From this analysis we were able to recognize not only the basic strengths of the weapon, but contextualize it and take into account both the environment around it, and if it presents any valuable and unique utility, that allows it to not only fit into a team comp, but excel in it when compared to other options.",
    "I heavily recommend taking this approach both when new weapons and kits come out, as well as when experimenting with any potential option that is currently underdeveloped. It may be difficult to do some of this if you are not experienced with the weapon, so it is usually advised to talk to respective experts of a weapon or do your own experimentation, but even a surface level analysis can still provide you with a great amount of insight",
