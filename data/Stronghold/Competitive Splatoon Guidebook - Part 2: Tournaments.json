  "content": "This is the finale of everything discussed in the Competitive Splatoon Guidebook . The skill of players and performance of teams gets put to the test in tournaments where they compete to be crowned the champion. In this second part, the various event formats employed by tournament organizers (a.k.a TOs) will be explained while also giving a list of frequent and popular tournament events for various skill levels.\n\n## Playing in tournaments\n\nBeing successful in a tournament is the goal of every competitive Splatoon team and player in the community. The tournaments are made by the community, for the community.\n\nMost tournaments are played in a \"best of #\" or \"round robin\" style. This is where you need to play several matches to win a round and go further in the tournament.\n\nThere is a really big variety of tournaments in the community.\n\n### Phrases\n\nBefore you go into a tournament with your team, you should know some common words and phrases used by the competitive community:\n\nLUTI Divisions: Divisions are shortened to Div eg. Div 5. Divisions usually run from Div X as the highest then Div 1-10.\n\nBo#: Best of # is used to say how many games you need to win to win the set of a round.  For example if you have a tournament that is \"bo3\" you need to win 2 matches to win the round. If it's a \"bo5\" you need to win 3 matches and so on. It says how many matches you need to win out of # to win a round.\n\nPA#: Play all # is used to say that you play all of the said amount of games. Say it’s “pa3”, you’ll play all three games regardless if one team won the first two games.\n\nRound Robin: Here a contestant meets all other contestants in their bracket before it ends or progresses into a \"bo#\" style bracket. It's the opposite of an elimination tournament and often takes much longer than an elimination tournament because there are many more matches.\n\nSign-Up: For every tournament you need to sign your team up at a set time before the tournament starts. You can do that on the Discord server of the tournament or on the tournament's page (such as Battlefy).\n\nCheck-In: A little bit before a tournament starts you need to show up at the check-in. This is done because the tournament organizer wants to check if everyone who signed up for the tournament is still able to play.\n\nTO: Short for tournament organizer.\n\n### Sign-up example\n\nThe staff of Low Ink, the largest low-level tournament, created a comprehensive guide on how to sign-up for Low Ink. The process can be applied to virtually any other tournament as well.\n\nhttps://lowink.iplabs.ink/howtoplay\n\nAt the end, it's important to point out that tournament organizers are only people like you and me and organize the tournaments in their free time, so make sure to be respectful.\n\n## Event formats\n\nThere are a couple main tournament formats that tournament organizers use to run tournament sets and matches.\n\nSingle Elimination: If you lose your set, you are knocked out of the tournament. You need to keep winning your sets to continue in this tournament format.\n\nDouble Elimination: If you lose your set, you have a second chance to win a different set before getting knocked out of the tournament.\n\nSwiss: In this format, you will play a set number of rounds. Your placement is determined by your performance in those rounds.\n\nGroups: In this format, all teams are divided into evenly numbered groups (ex. 40 teams divided into 10 groups of 4) where teams will play for the top spot in their group.\n\nSwiss -> Single Elimination: Based on your placement in swiss, you may qualify to move on to the top cut bracket where you’ll be playing in a single elimination format.\n\nSwiss -> Double Elimination: Based on your placement in swiss, you may qualify to move on to the top cut bracket where you’ll be playing in a double elimination format.\n\nGroups -> Single Elimination: Based on your placement in your group, you may qualify to move on to the top cut bracket where you’ll be playing in a single elimination format.\n\nGroups -> Double Elimination: Based on your placement in your group, you may qualify to move on to the top cut bracket where you’ll be playing in a single elimination format.\n\nSpeed Ladder: A format where teams randomly match against each other and as soon as your set is over, you can advance on to the next one regardless if you won or lost your previous set. This goes on for a certain amount of time (usually a couple hours) and the team with the highest amount of points earned from wins is crowned the champion.\n\n## Tournament Organizations\n\nListed below are some well-known and reputable tournament organizations that work to provide high-quality tournaments for competitive players.\n\n### Inkling Performance Labs\n\nBluesky - Discord - Twitter - Twitch - YouTube\n\nInkling Performance Labs' goal is to unite and grow the community by creating high quality Splatoon tournaments.
