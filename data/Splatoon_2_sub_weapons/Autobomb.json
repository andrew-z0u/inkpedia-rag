The main part of the bomb is white with multiple rivets along the edges and two black screws that look a bit like eyes. On top of the Autobomb is a raised section with a windshield-like sensor, both of which change color to match the user's ink. The sensor lights up when the bomb is about to explode. On the back is a propeller that changes color to match the user's ink. The legs are dark gray and attached to the body's sides, and the \"feet\" change color to match the user's ink. The Autobombs used by Agent 4 in Octo Canyon are black and white with a blue raised section and sensor. The \"toes\" are gold-colored.\n\nAutobombs are comparable to Seekers from Splatoon. Unlike Seekers, however, they are thrown and do not roll on the ground, do not leave a trail of ink, and can freely change direction. Once thrown, Autobombs seek out any enemy players in the vicinity, indicated by the circle which appears once the Autobomb has landed, and automatically move towards them for quite a long time. Once the Autobomb reaches a player or travels far enough without reaching the player, it explodes. If thrown and no enemies are in range, the Autobomb automatically explodes where it was thrown, similar to a Suction Bomb.\n\nDue to the fact that the Autobomb walks towards nearby opponents, it can be used to locate hiding enemies. The Autobomb is small, does not spread ink, and is able to walk in enemy ink unaffected, so it can sneak up on opponents more effectively than a player can. However, it continuously makes noise while traveling toward the player it is tracking, similar to a Seeker.\n\nSub Power Up increases throwing range and air travel velocity for the Autobomb.\n\n- A02 Far-Out Station\n\n- B04 Rad Ride Station\n\n- E11 Bodacious Rotation Station\n\n- F09 Bring It Station\n\n- G09B05 Wack 8-Ball Station\n\n- H03 Sweet Ride Station\n\n- I08 Radio Station\n\n- — Slightly increased the volume of the pre-detonation effects.\n\n- ▲ Ink consumption: 70 → 55\n\n- ▼ Decreased maximum target tracking time by 1.5 seconds.\n\n- ▼ Decreased damage radius when exploding by roughly 7%.\n\n- ▲ Decreased time after use for the Autobomb to start walking in the direction of its target by roughly 20/60 of a second.\n\n- ▲ Decreased time before ink recovery starts after use by roughly 15/60 of a second.\n\n- ▲ Increased the explosion's maximum damage from 150.0 to 180.0.\n\nIt scans the area it lands in and walks towards any enemy it detects.\n\nOnce it gets close enough to its target, it stops and explodes.\n\n- Official rendering of the Autobomb.\n\n- Four Autobombs.\n\n- An Autobomb with two enemy Inklings nearby.\n\n- An Autobomb with some birds flying away from it.\n\n- Autobomb in Octo Canyon.\n\n- Autobomb mem cake.\n\n- Autobomb mini figurine by Sun Art.\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:Autobomb_chase.mp4\n\n\nAnimation of an Autobomb chasing an Inkling boy.(link to file)\n\nAutobombs return in Splatoon 3, looking identical to how they did in the previous game.\n\n- — Reduced the radius at which the blast can deal maximum damage to an opponent by roughly 12%: 3.25 units → 2.85 units[2]\nAlthough the blast radius was reduced, the way the game handles hit detection for the inner blast radius was changed, thus the effective blast radius remains about the same.\n\n- Although the blast radius was reduced, the way the game handles hit detection for the inner blast radius was changed, thus the effective blast radius remains about the same.\n\n- Although the blast radius was reduced, the way the game handles hit detection for the inner blast radius was changed, thus the effective blast radius remains about the same.\n\n- ▲ Increased the radius of the enemy detection area by approximately 8%: 11.5 units → 12.5 units.\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- 3D Tableturf Battle artwork.\n\n- 2D icon\n\nFor competitive tips about the Autobomb\n\n- Despite never going under ink, the Autobomb is designed to look like a small submarine or submersible with a propeller guard.\nThe Squid Research Lab later revealed it was based on the design of the Shinkai 6500, a submersible used by JAMSTEC, which was featured as a background element in C11 Abracadabra Station.\n\n- The Squid Research Lab later revealed it was based on the design of the Shinkai 6500, a submersible used by JAMSTEC, which was featured as a background element in C11 Abracadabra Station.\n\n- The Custom Splattershot Jr.'s large ink tank can be used to throw out two Autobombs in quick succession without the need of Ink Saver (Sub). There is a way to throw four Autobombs in quick succession without submerging in ink to refill. To do this, throw two Autobombs, activate the Ink Storm, then throw out two more Autobombs with the freshly recovered ink.\n\n- The Squid Research Lab later revealed it was based on the design of the Shinkai 6500, a submersible used by JAMSTEC, which was featured as a background element in C11 Abracadabra Station."
