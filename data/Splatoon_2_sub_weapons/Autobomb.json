    "The Autobomb is a sub weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3. It is a bomb that automatically seeks enemies out to explode near them.",
    "The Autobomb is shaped like a submarine with legs. The main part of the bomb is white with multiple rivets along the edges and two black screws that look a bit like eyes. On top of the Autobomb is a raised section with a windshield-like sensor, both of which change color to match the user's ink. The sensor lights up when the bomb is about to explode. On the back is a propeller that changes color to match the user's ink. The legs are dark gray and attached to the body's sides, and the \"feet\" change color to match the user's ink. The Autobombs used by Agent 4 in Octo Canyon are black and white with a blue raised section and sensor. The \"toes\" are gold-colored.",
    "Autobombs are comparable to Seekers from Splatoon. Unlike Seekers, however, they are thrown and do not roll on the ground, do not leave a trail of ink, and can freely change direction. Once thrown, Autobombs seek out any enemy players in the vicinity, indicated by the circle which appears once the Autobomb has landed, and automatically move towards them for quite a long time. Once the Autobomb reaches a player or travels far enough without reaching the player, it explodes. If thrown and no enemies are in range, the Autobomb automatically explodes where it was thrown, similar to a Suction Bomb.",
    "Due to the fact that the Autobomb walks towards nearby opponents, it can be used to locate hiding enemies. The Autobomb is small, does not spread ink, and is able to walk in enemy ink unaffected, so it can sneak up on opponents more effectively than a player can. However, it continuously makes noise while traveling toward the player it is tracking, similar to a Seeker.",

    "- Despite never going under ink, the Autobomb is designed to look like a small submarine or submersible with a propeller guard.\nThe Squid Research Lab later revealed it was based on the design of the Shinkai 6500, a submersible used by JAMSTEC, which was featured as a background element in C11 Abracadabra Station.",
    "- The Custom Splattershot Jr.'s large ink tank can be used to throw out two Autobombs in quick succession without the need of Ink Saver (Sub). There is a way to throw four Autobombs in quick succession without submerging in ink to refill. To do this, throw two Autobombs, activate the Ink Storm, then throw out two more Autobombs with the freshly recovered ink."
