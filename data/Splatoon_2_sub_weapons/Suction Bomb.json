  "content": "The Suction Bomb is a sub weapon in the Splatoon series. Suction Bombs can be thrown and attach to virtually any surface, including walls and ceilings. After two seconds, they explode in a burst of ink, covering area.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Splatoon\n\n2.1 Quotes\n2.2 Sets\n2.3 Ink management\n2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.1 Quotes\n\n- 2.2 Sets\n\n- 2.3 Ink management\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 3 Splatoon 2\n\n3.1 Version history\n3.2 Quotes\n3.3 Sets\n3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.1 Version history\n\n- 3.2 Quotes\n\n- 3.3 Sets\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 4 Splatoon 3\n\n4.1 Side Order\n4.2 Version history\n4.3 Quotes\n4.4 Sets\n4.5 Gallery\n\n- 4.1 Side Order\n\n- 4.2 Version history\n\n- 4.3 Quotes\n\n- 4.4 Sets\n\n- 4.5 Gallery\n\n- 5 Strategy\n\n- 6 Trivia\n\n- 7 Names in other languages\n\n- 8 Notes\n\n- 9 References\n\n- 2.1 Quotes\n\n- 2.2 Sets\n\n- 2.3 Ink management\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.1 Version history\n\n- 3.2 Quotes\n\n- 3.3 Sets\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 4.1 Side Order\n\n- 4.2 Version history\n\n- 4.3 Quotes\n\n- 4.4 Sets\n\n- 4.5 Gallery\n\nSuction Bombs bear a strong resemblance to a can of spray paint, but with a black suction cup connected to the nozzle. The can matches the user's ink color, and the small dots change color too. The can also has two white dots with black dots inside of them, representing eyes. The body of the bomb has some Inkling text on it.\n\nThrowing a Suction Bomb costs 70% of the player's ink tank under normal circumstances, just like the Splat Bomb. It will also immediately explode upon contact with the Rainmaker's shield or a Splash Wall.\n\nThe main differences between the Splat Bomb and Suction Bomb are as follows.\n\n- Splat Bomb explodes 1 second after touching the floor, while the Suction Bomb explodes 2 seconds after touching any surface.\n\n- Splat Bombs have a radius of roughly 0.75 lines for dealing 180.0 damage and beyond that another 0.75 lines for dealing 30.0 damage (total radius is 1.5 lines for damage). To make up for its longer timer, the Suction bomb has a larger range of 1.0 lines for dealing 180.0 damage, and an additional 0.75 lines for dealing 30.0 damage (total radius is 1.75 for dealing damage)\n\n- Splat Bomb will ink a radius of roughly 0.75 lines. Suction Bombs will ink a radius of roughly 1 line.\n\nAs Suction Bombs can be used to herd an opponent into a vulnerable position, it is important to be able to continue firing after using the bomb and fully capitalize on the battlefield control provided by the Suction Bomb. The 70% ink consumed by the Suction Bomb makes it desirable to use the ink management abilities Ink Saver (Main) and Ink Saver (Sub). The charts below show the combinations needed to achieve particular shot counts after using a Suction Bomb. Alternatively, a combination of Ink Recovery Up and Ink Saver (Sub) is useful if the player just wants to throw more bombs, as opposed to throwing a bomb and then using the main weapon. After deploying a Suction Bomb, there is a 1 second delay before ink can be refilled again. With 3 mains and 2 subs of Ink Saver (Sub), 2 Suction Bombs may be deployed with one full ink tank.\n\n- Berry Splattershot Pro\n\n- H-3 Nozzlenose\n\n- Fresh Squiffer\n\n- Mini Splatling\n\n- Rapid Blaster Deco\n\n- Splash-o-matic\n\n- Splat Roller, Hero Roller Replica\n\n- Tentatek Splattershot, Octoshot Replica\n\n- Suction Bomb HQ image.\n\n- A Suction Bomb attached to a wall.\n\n- Official art of an Inkling with two Suction Bombs and a Tentatek Splattershot.\n\n- Promotional art with an Inkling boy (left) holding Suction Bombs.\n\n- Art for Splatoon's first anniversary, with an Inkling (far right) with a Suction Bomb.\n\n- Concept art of various sub Weapons, with the Suction Bomb at the left.\n\n- Early Suction Bomb\n\nThe Suction Bomb returns in Splatoon 2.\n\n- — Slightly increased the volume of the pre-detonation effects.\n\n- ▼ Reduced the radius at which the blast can deal 30.0 damage to an opponent by roughly 11%.\n\n- ▲ Increased maximum explosion damage from 180.0 to 220.0.\nHowever, damage dealt to Bubble Blower bubbles remains unchanged.\n\n- However, damage dealt to Bubble Blower bubbles remains unchanged.\n\n- However, damage dealt to Bubble Blower bubbles remains unchanged.\n\nIt takes longer to explode than a Splat Bomb, but it has a larger blast radius.\n\n- Promotional render of Suction Bomb.\n\n- The Suction Bomb from the Octo Canyon mission Bomb Rush Blush.\n\n- Suction Bombs in a promotional image for the Luna Blaster Neo.\n\n- Suction Bomb mem cake.\n\nThe Suction Bomb returns in Splatoon 3.
