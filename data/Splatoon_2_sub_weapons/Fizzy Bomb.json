The can itself has the logo of Fizzy on it as well as a simple bubble pattern and changes color to match the user's ink. The metal attached to the top and bottom of the can is strapped to a wraparound belt, seeming to be a length of hose clamp. When the can is shaken, it expands and there is a clicking noise that is presumably the belt expanding along with it. When the Fizzy Bomb is at its maximum charge, the can begins to glow.\n\nThe Fizzy Bomb is a Bomb-type sub weapon that is capable of exploding multiple times. It can be charged up by holding down the  button, increasing the amount of times it explodes. Each explosion propels the bomb forward a small amount. To charge it up faster, the player can also shake the controllers physically, jump in-game continuously (mash ), or move around in-game quickly. When  is released, the bomb is thrown. It sprays a thin ink trail behind it as it travels before exploding. Depending on how long it was charged, it may explode up to three times.\nWith each new charge, the bomb makes a \"clink\" sound. Upon finishing the final charge, the \"clink\" sound is louder. The weapon was first teased at the September 2018 Nintendo Direct, along with the Kensa Collection of weapons, two new special weapons and changes to Splatfest.\nThe Fizzy Bomb was released in version 4.1.0.[1].\n\n- ▼ Increased time after use before ink recovery begins by roughly 10/60 of a second.\n\n- ▼ Decreased the effect of the Ink Saver (Sub) gear ability.\n\n- ▼ Decreased the radius of ink coverage from the 2nd explosion by roughly 15%.\n\n- ▼ Decreased the radius of ink coverage from the 3rd explosion by roughly 21%.\n\n- ▼ Decreased damage radius of second and third explosions by roughly 6%.\n\nHold  to build power, then unleash up to three explosions.\n\nShake the controller, move the stick or mash  to build power quicker!\n\n- Promotional render.\n\n- An Octoling boy shaking the Fizzy Bomb.\n\n- An Octoling boy and two Inklings shaking the Fizzy Bomb.\n\n- An Inkling girl throwing the Fizzy Bomb.\n\n- An Octoling girl holding the Fizzy Bomb.\n\n- Promotional image featuring multiple Fizzy Bombs on the upper right.\n\n- An early model of the Fizzy Bomb found in the games files.\n\nThe Fizzy Bomb returns in Splatoon 3.\n\nFizzy Bomb appears in Side Order as the base sub weapon of Frye's Palette. They also appear as a purchasable sub weapon on Vending-Machine Corner Floors, costing 500 Membux by default.\n\n- — Reduced the radius at which the blast of the first explosion can deal 50 damage by 20%: 2 → 1.6 units.[2]\n\n- — Reduced the radius at which the blast of the second explosion can deal 50 damage by roughly 17%: 2.35 → 1.95 units.\n\n- — Reduced the radius at which the blast of the third explosion can deal 50 damage by roughly 13%: 3 → 2.6 units.\nAlthough the blast radii were reduced, the way the game handles hit detection for the inner blast radii was changed, thus the effective blast radii remain about the same.\n\n- Although the blast radii were reduced, the way the game handles hit detection for the inner blast radii was changed, thus the effective blast radii remain about the same.\n\n- Although the blast radii were reduced, the way the game handles hit detection for the inner blast radii was changed, thus the effective blast radii remain about the same.\n\n- ▼ Increased the time it takes for ink to start recovering after using a Fizzy Bomb by about 0.25 seconds: 70 frames → 85 frames.\n\n- — The sound effects when the Splat Bomb, Torpedo, or Fizzy Bomb roll on the ground are now easier to hear.\n\n- — Fixed an issue while charging a Fizzy Bomb that sometimes indicated the number of charged explosions had increased approximately 1/60 seconds faster than when they had actually increased.\n\n- ▼ Adjusted the way that they bounce due to explosions and slightly reduced the distance moved with one explosion.\nWith this change, the area that can be inked with 2 or more explosions will be reduced.\n\n- With this change, the area that can be inked with 2 or more explosions will be reduced.\n\n- ▲ The area that can be inked with dropped ink spray when not charged to full power will be expanded.\n\n- With this change, the area that can be inked with 2 or more explosions will be reduced.\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- Tableturf Battle 3D artwork\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- 2D icon used in Side Order.\n\nFor competitive tips about the Fizzy Bomb\n\n- This weapon was found by data mining as early as version 3.1.0, functional but without a model. It had the internal code name \"Piyo\", which is a common placeholder name in Japanese computer programming.\n\n- The Fizzy Bomb is the first sub weapon to have been added post-release in the Splatoon franchise.\n\n- The Fizzy Bomb was shown in the version 4.0.0 trailer, but neither the Kensa Sloshing Machine nor the Kensa Luna Blaster were made available until version 4.1.0.\n\n- The text on the can can be seen on banners in Kelp Dome.\n\n- The Fizzy Bomb is not in any Octo Expansion station, as it was released after the Octo Expansion came out.\nIt does not appear in any missions of Return of the Mammalians either, despite appearing in the game on launch.\n\n- It does not appear in any missions of Return of the Mammalians either, despite appearing in the game on launch.\n\n- It does not appear in any missions of Return of the Mammalians either, despite appearing in the game on launch.\n\nFizzy Bomb is a reference to the fizz, or the hissing sound and bubbles of gas, that cans of soda can release if opened after being shaken, similar to the weapon's charging animation. In addition, the weapon resembles a soda can, as well as an M67 grenade."
