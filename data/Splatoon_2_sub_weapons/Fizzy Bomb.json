    "The Fizzy Bomb is a sub weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3. It is a bomb that can be 'shaken' to explode up to three times in succession.",
    "The Fizzy Bomb appears to be a soda can with some metal pieces attached to it. The can itself has the logo of Fizzy on it as well as a simple bubble pattern and changes color to match the user's ink. The metal attached to the top and bottom of the can is strapped to a wraparound belt, seeming to be a length of hose clamp. When the can is shaken, it expands and there is a clicking noise that is presumably the belt expanding along with it. When the Fizzy Bomb is at its maximum charge, the can begins to glow.",
    "The Fizzy Bomb is a Bomb-type sub weapon that is capable of exploding multiple times. It can be charged up by holding down the  button, increasing the amount of times it explodes. Each explosion propels the bomb forward a small amount. To charge it up faster, the player can also shake the controllers physically, jump in-game continuously (mash ), or move around in-game quickly. When  is released, the bomb is thrown. It sprays a thin ink trail behind it as it travels before exploding. Depending on how long it was charged, it may explode up to three times.\nWith each new charge, the bomb makes a \"clink\" sound. Upon finishing the final charge, the \"clink\" sound is louder. The weapon was first teased at the September 2018 Nintendo Direct, along with the Kensa Collection of weapons, two new special weapons and changes to Splatfest.\nThe Fizzy Bomb was released in version 4.1.0.[1].",

    "- This weapon was found by data mining as early as version 3.1.0, functional but without a model. It had the internal code name \"Piyo\", which is a common placeholder name in Japanese computer programming.",
    "- The Fizzy Bomb is the first sub weapon to have been added post-release in the Splatoon franchise.",
    "- The Fizzy Bomb was shown in the version 4.0.0 trailer, but neither the Kensa Sloshing Machine nor the Kensa Luna Blaster were made available until version 4.1.0.",
    "- The text on the can can be seen on banners in Kelp Dome.",
    "- The Fizzy Bomb is not in any Octo Expansion station, as it was released after the Octo Expansion came out.\nIt does not appear in any missions of Return of the Mammalians either, despite appearing in the game on launch.",
    "Fizzy Bomb is a reference to the fizz, or the hissing sound and bubbles of gas, that cans of soda can release if opened after being shaken, similar to the weapon's charging animation. In addition, the weapon resembles a soda can, as well as an M67 grenade."
