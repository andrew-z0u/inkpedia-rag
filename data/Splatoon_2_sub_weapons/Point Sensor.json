The sides of the Point Sensor have dark blue panels on them, and two similar panels stick out of the bottom. Once thrown, the Point Sensor explodes in a cloud that is black and the same color as the user's ink, and some black arrows surround the area where the Point Sensor was thrown. Enemies tagged by the Point Sensor are encircled by a similar arrow and tied to members of the Point Sensor user's team with a line of the user's ink color, although each line is only visible to the member it leads to.\n\nWhen thrown, they explode in a spherical cloud that has the color of the player's ink and tag any enemy Inkling in a certain range with a swirling squid marker. This marker allows tagged enemies to be seen through barriers by all teammates, allowing them to be easily tracked.\n\n- It tracks an enemy for eight seconds normally or two seconds if the target has Cold Blooded. Before version 2.2.0, it would normally track for ten seconds or 2.5 seconds with Cold Blooded.[1] Due to lag and other factors, the exact time may vary slightly during online play.\n\n- With no Ink Saver (Sub), it requires 40% of maximum ink tank capacity.\n\n- Upon hitting a surface, the blast radius is roughly 3 lines in diameter, 1.5 in radius. Pre-version 2.2.0, it was about 2.5 lines in diameter and 1.25 in radius.\n\n- Throw distance can be increased with Bomb Range Up.\n\n- Can be thrown against a wall to track enemies on the other side, as long as they are within the blast radius.\n\n- ▲ Increased the radius of the area that effects enemies by 17%.\n\n- ▼ Decreased the duration from 10.0 seconds to 8.0 seconds.\n\n- Point Sensor HQ image.\n\n- A Point Sensor in play.\n\n- A Point Sensor after it has been thrown.\n\n- A tagged enemy.\n\n- Official art of an Inkling with a Point Sensor and an H-3 Nozzlenose D.\n\nIn Splatoon 2, Point Sensors have an area of effect that lasts 2.5 seconds. Any player that enters the area of effect during that time is tracked.\n\n- The total amount of time a player is tracked can change depending on when the player enters the Point Sensor's area of effect. On a direct hit, the tracking time lasts the full eight seconds, while entering the area of effect afterwards reduces the tracking length by the amount of time since the point sensor landed.\nFor example: if a player walks into the area of effect two seconds after the Point Sensor lands, the player is marked for a total of six seconds instead of eight seconds.\n\n- For example: if a player walks into the area of effect two seconds after the Point Sensor lands, the player is marked for a total of six seconds instead of eight seconds.\n\n- Players hit by multiple Point Sensors from different opponents are marked concurrently. Assists are awarded to both Point Sensor users if the tracked player dies to another opponent or if they jump off the stage.\n\n- Players can be repeatedly marked by a Point Sensor to effectively reset the remaining tracking time back to eight seconds.\n\n- The base total tracking time can be increased from eight seconds to a maximum of sixteen seconds using Sub Power Up.\n\n- Bomb Defense Up DX reduces the tracking time of the Point Sensor by a percentage of the maximum tracking time.\nFor example: if a player wears enough Bomb Defense Up DX to reduce the tracking time by 50%; an eight-second Point Sensor is reduced to four seconds while a Sub Power Up-boosted sixteen-second Point Sensor reduces its tracking time to eight seconds for that player.\n\n- For example: if a player wears enough Bomb Defense Up DX to reduce the tracking time by 50%; an eight-second Point Sensor is reduced to four seconds while a Sub Power Up-boosted sixteen-second Point Sensor reduces its tracking time to eight seconds for that player.\n\n- For example: if a player walks into the area of effect two seconds after the Point Sensor lands, the player is marked for a total of six seconds instead of eight seconds.\n\n- For example: if a player wears enough Bomb Defense Up DX to reduce the tracking time by 50%; an eight-second Point Sensor is reduced to four seconds while a Sub Power Up-boosted sixteen-second Point Sensor reduces its tracking time to eight seconds for that player.\n\n- ▲ Lingering area of effect that lasts 2.5 seconds added.\n\n- ▼ Ink consumption: 40% → 60%\n\n- ▼ Time taken to begin recovering ink after throwing out the Point Sensor: 0.83 seconds → 1.50 seconds\n\n- ▲ Increased radius of effect by roughly 20%.\n\n- ▲ Decreased delay until start of ink recovery after throwing out the Point Sensor by 15/60 of a second.\n\n- ▲ Sub Power Up now also increases the duration of time opponents remain marked.\n\n- — Made it easier to hear the sound effects when it detonates.\n\n- ▲ Increased initial speed by roughly 21%, and also increased throwing distance.\n\n- ▲ Increased initial speed by roughly 10%, and also increased throwing distance.\n\n- ▲ Decreased ink consumption from 60% to 55% of a standard ink tank.\n\n- ▲ Increased the effect of the Ink Saver (Sub) gear ability.\n\n- ▲ Decreased ink consumption from 55% to 45% of a standard ink tank.\n\n- ▼ Decreased movement speed and distance of Point Sensor when thrown.\n▼ Decreased movement speed of Point Sensor when thrown and when not using the Sub Power Up gear ability by roughly 8%.\n▼ Decreased movement speed of Point Sensor when thrown and when maximum amount of Sub Power Up gear ability is equipped by roughly 2%.\n\n- ▼ Decreased movement speed of Point Sensor when thrown and when not using the Sub Power Up gear ability by roughly 8%.\n\n- ▼ Decreased movement speed of Point Sensor when thrown and when maximum amount of Sub Power Up gear ability is equipped by roughly 2%.\n\n- ▼ Decreased effect of Ink Saver (Sub) gear ability by roughly 8%.\n\n- ▼ Decreased movement speed of Point Sensor when thrown and when not using the Sub Power Up gear ability by roughly 8%.\n\n- ▼ Decreased movement speed of Point Sensor when thrown and when maximum amount of Sub Power Up gear ability is equipped by roughly 2%.\n\nThis will reveal their location to every member of your team.\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- Throwing the Point Sensor\n\n- An enemy Inkling located\n\nPoint Sensors return in Splatoon 3, with attributes identical to those in the previous game.\n\n- — Fixed an issue where a Point Sensor or Toxic Mist would disappear without activating when hitting certain terrain or an Ultra Stamp.\n\n- A Point Sensor being tossed out\n\n- 3D Tableturf Battle artwork\n\n- 2D icon\n\nFor competitive tips about the Point Sensor\n\n- The Point Sensor, in function, is very similar to the Echolocator special weapon.\n\n- The Point Sensor resembles a miniaturized artificial satellite for weather news in appearance."
