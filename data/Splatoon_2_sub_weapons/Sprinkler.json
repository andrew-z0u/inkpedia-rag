  "content": "The Sprinkler is a sub weapon in the Splatoon series. It is thrown and attaches to any surface, and sprays ink in a circular ring around itself in a staggering motion indefinitely until it is destroyed by an opponent.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Uses\n\n- 3 Splatoon\n\n3.1 Ink management\n3.2 Quotes\n3.3 Sets\n3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.1 Ink management\n\n- 3.2 Quotes\n\n- 3.3 Sets\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 4 Splatoon 2\n\n4.1 Version history\n4.2 Quotes\n4.3 Sets\n4.4 Gallery\n\n- 4.1 Version history\n\n- 4.2 Quotes\n\n- 4.3 Sets\n\n- 4.4 Gallery\n\n- 5 Splatoon 3\n\n5.1 Side Order\n5.2 Version history\n5.3 Quotes\n5.4 Sets\n5.5 Gallery\n\n- 5.1 Side Order\n\n- 5.2 Version history\n\n- 5.3 Quotes\n\n- 5.4 Sets\n\n- 5.5 Gallery\n\n- 6 Strategy\n\n- 7 Trivia\n\n- 8 Names in other languages\n\n- 9 References\n\n- 3.1 Ink management\n\n- 3.2 Quotes\n\n- 3.3 Sets\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 4.1 Version history\n\n- 4.2 Quotes\n\n- 4.3 Sets\n\n- 4.4 Gallery\n\n- 5.1 Side Order\n\n- 5.2 Version history\n\n- 5.3 Quotes\n\n- 5.4 Sets\n\n- 5.5 Gallery\n\nThe Sprinkler has two main parts; a base and a head. The base is flat and cone-shaped with a black bottom. It changes color to match the user's ink and has its manufacturer's logo on it. The head is a short, wide pole with two flat and rectangular nozzles sticking out of it. The pole and nozzles are black and the nozzles have attachments that change color to match the user's ink. Once deployed, the Sprinkler's appearance is unchanged other than it spinning around and shooting ink.\n\n- Sprinkler has 120 HP, and can be used to block enemy shots during combat if an opponent does not have Object Shredder.\n\n- The most effective spots for Sprinklers are those that are hard to see or reach. These include on top of boxes, sideways on walls, or on objects over the stage.\n\n- Exploring stages in Recon mode makes it easy to find strategic locations for Sprinklers without the pressure of a battle.\n\n- Putting a Sprinkler directly at one's feet can allow a chance to react should an enemy launch a sneak attack.\n\n- Sprinklers placed on or near the Tower in Tower Control can provide some cover for the user and their allies.\n\n- Like Squid Beakons, Sprinklers can be used as light shields in a pinch, taking some damage in place of the user.\n\n- Also like Beakons, Sprinklers work as bait to attract players and ambush them while reaching to destroy the Sprinkler.\nEven when not used as shields, the attention drawn by an unguarded Sprinkler can be used to one's advantage for an ambush or escape.\n\n- Even when not used as shields, the attention drawn by an unguarded Sprinkler can be used to one's advantage for an ambush or escape.\n\n- One should avoid getting too close to enemy Sprinklers - while their damage is low, multiple hits can be dangerous.\n\n- A Sprinkler may be bait, especially if stuck to a high wall or ceiling. It would be wise to keep an eye on one's surroundings when destroying it.\n\n- If the user already has a Sprinkler in use, throwing another Sprinkler will break the first one.\n\n- Even when not used as shields, the attention drawn by an unguarded Sprinkler can be used to one's advantage for an ambush or escape.\n\nSprinklers sprays ink droplets every six frames until it is destroyed.\n\nThe charts below show that with ability slots stacked with Ink Saver (Main) and Ink Saver (Sub), additional shots can be fired after throwing a Sprinkler from a full ink tank.\n\n- .96 Gal\n\n- Custom Hydra Splatling\n\n- Dynamo Roller\n\n- Heavy Splatling Remix\n\n- Inkbrush\n\n- Kelp Splat Charger and Kelp Splatterscope\n\n- N-Zap '89\n\n- High quality Sprinkler.\n\n- The effects of a Sprinkler.\n\n- An Inkling throwing a Sprinkler.\n\n- Concept art of various sub weapons, with the Sprinkler at the upper left.\n\n- Early Sprinkler\n\nThe Sprinkler was tweaked in Splatoon 2 to have its inking power start out stronger but weaken over time. There are four distinct phases:\n\n- Deployment phase: This phase starts when the Sprinkler lands on the ground and ends when it fires its first drop of ink. This phase lasts 0.5 seconds.\n\n- High-power phase: The Sprinkler spins the fastest and has the most inking power during this phase. It fires ink droplets every four frames and rotates 33 degrees per frame. It lasts for 5 seconds.\n\n- Mid-power phase: The Sprinkler slows down and inks less in this phase. It fires ink droplets every six frames and rotates eleven degrees per frame. It lasts fifteen seconds.\n\n- Low-power phase: The Sprinkler slows down even further, with very low ink output and range. It fires ink droplets every ten frames and rotates one degree per frame. This phase lasts until the Sprinkler is relocated or destroyed.\n\nThe Sprinkler has 120 HP. Object Shredder multiplies the damage done against Sprinklers by ten.\n\n- ▼ Base damage per hit: 30 → 20\n\n- Reworked to fire ink droplets from a rate of 6 frames indefinitely to a rate of 4 frames for 5 seconds, then 6 frames for 10 seconds, then 10 frames indefinitely.\n\n- ▲ Of the three levels of ink spray the Sprinkler gives off after placement, duration of the medium level of ink spray was extended by 5 seconds.\n\n- ▲ Ink consumption: 80% → 70%\n\n- ▲ Sub Power Up increases the duration of time the Sprinkler sprays ink at maximum power by roughly 150%.\n\n- ▲ Decreased ink consumption from 70% to 60% of ink tank capacity.\n\n- ▲ Decreased degree to which less area is inked proportional to distance between Sprinkler and terrain floor when placed in a location with a different height than surrounding terrain.\n\n- ▲ Increased durability by roughly 20%.\n\n- Due to the above fix, damage dealt by certain attacks has also changed.\n▲ Decreased damage dealt by Sting Rays by roughly 58%.\n▲ Decreased damage dealt by Ink Storms by roughly 67%.\n▼ Increased damage dealt by Nozzlenose weapons by roughly 20%.\n▼ Increased damage dealt by Blaster weapons by roughly 20%.\n▼ Increased damage dealt by vertical swing attacks with Roller weapons by roughly 20%.\n\n- ▲ Decreased damage dealt by Sting Rays by roughly 58%.\n\n- ▲ Decreased damage dealt by Ink Storms by roughly 67%.\n\n- ▼ Increased damage dealt by Nozzlenose weapons by roughly 20%.\n\n- ▼ Increased damage dealt by Blaster weapons by roughly 20%.\n\n- ▼ Increased damage dealt by vertical swing attacks with Roller weapons by roughly 20%.\n\n- ▼ Decreased damage range and inking radius during the high-power phase.\n\n- ▲ Decreased damage dealt by Sting Rays by roughly 58%.\n\n- ▲ Decreased damage dealt by Ink Storms by roughly 67%.\n\n- ▼ Increased damage dealt by Nozzlenose weapons by roughly 20%.\n\n- ▼ Increased damage dealt by Blaster weapons by roughly 20%.\n\n- ▼ Increased damage dealt by vertical swing attacks with Roller weapons by roughly 20%.\n\n- ▲ Increased the effect of the Ink Saver (Sub) gear ability.\n\n- ▲ Decreased time before the Sprinkler begins shooting ink after being placed by roughly 30/60 of a second.\n\n- ▲ Increased radius of ink spray when placed on a wall or the ground by roughly 2.5 times.\n\nImmediately after deployment it sprays vigorously, but gradually dwindles in strength.\n\nYou can only place one at a time.\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- Sprinkler in work on higher ground.\n\n- Sprinkler covering the ground around it making it difficult for enemy Inklings to walk.\n\nThe Sprinkler returns in Splatoon 3. It functions identically to how it did in Splatoon 2.\n\nSprinkler appears in Side Order as the base sub weapon of Marina's Palette. They also appear as a purchasable sub weapon on Vending-Machine Corner Floors, costing 500 Membux by default.\n\n- ▲ Extended the duration of the state where the ink is strongest immediately after placement by approximately 3 seconds: 5s → 8s.\n\n- — Fixed an issue where it was sometimes impossible to destroy an enemy's Sprinkler with a bomb when the bomb and Sprinkler overlapped.\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- 3D Tableturf Battle artwork\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- 2D icon in Side Order\n\n- The Drone Sprinkler ability where the Pearl Drone is a Sprinkler.\n\nFor competitive tips about the Sprinkler\n\n- The Dolphin logo can be found on the lower part of the Sprinkler.\n\n- Marie calls throwing a Sprinkler in the last few seconds of a battle in order to gain a bit more turf \"Last Day of Summer\".\n\n- In the quotes for Goby Arena, Marina refers to \"Splatted by Sprinkler\" as the three most embarrassing words in the Inkling language.\n\n- It resembles a water sprinkler, hence the name."
