    "Toxic Mist is a sub weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3. It is a thrown bottle that, on impact, releases a toxic cloud that slows and drains the ink of any enemies within it.",
    "When thrown, Toxic Mist surrounds a circular area in fog. Opponents caught in the fog move more slowly and gradually lose ink.",
    "Players that stay in the fog for a long time are more severely affected.[1] It takes about 8.33 seconds for Toxic Mist to deplete a full ink tank, even with the high-capacity ink tank that comes with the Splattershot Jr. The fog remains on the stage for about 5.13 seconds before dissipating. Prior to Version 5.2.0, players in a Baller were immune to Toxic Mist.[2] Dualies that perform a dodge roll while they are in Toxic Mist use up 3.5 times the ink.[3]",
    "Sub Power Up increases throwing range and air travel velocity for Toxic Mist.",
    "In the Octo Canyon levels Octoling Assault and Octoling Workout, Toxic Mist appears as a stationary obstacle. This version of Toxic Mist appears as a bottle similar to the version thrown as a sub weapon, which activates when Agent 4 approaches it, creating a sphere of mist surrounding it. Unlike the sub-weapon version of Toxic Mist, this version does not dissipate over time, only disappearing when the bottle in the center of the mist is destroyed by ink.",
    "The movement of any opponent who enters the mist will be slowed and their ink tank will slowly drain.",
    "The longer the time spent in the mist, the stronger the effect.",
    "Toxic Mist returns in Splatoon 3, functioning the same as it did previously.",
    "Toxic Mist appears in Side Order as the base sub weapon of Shiver's Palette. They also appear as a purchasable sub weapon on Vending-Machine Corner Floors, costing 500 Membux by default.",
