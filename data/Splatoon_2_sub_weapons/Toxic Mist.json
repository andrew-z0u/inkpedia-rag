Opponents caught in the fog move more slowly and gradually lose ink.\n\nPlayers that stay in the fog for a long time are more severely affected.[1] It takes about 8.33 seconds for Toxic Mist to deplete a full ink tank, even with the high-capacity ink tank that comes with the Splattershot Jr. The fog remains on the stage for about 5.13 seconds before dissipating. Prior to Version 5.2.0, players in a Baller were immune to Toxic Mist.[2] Dualies that perform a dodge roll while they are in Toxic Mist use up 3.5 times the ink.[3]\n\nSub Power Up increases throwing range and air travel velocity for Toxic Mist.\n\nIn the Octo Canyon levels Octoling Assault and Octoling Workout, Toxic Mist appears as a stationary obstacle. This version of Toxic Mist appears as a bottle similar to the version thrown as a sub weapon, which activates when Agent 4 approaches it, creating a sphere of mist surrounding it. Unlike the sub-weapon version of Toxic Mist, this version does not dissipate over time, only disappearing when the bottle in the center of the mist is destroyed by ink.\n\n- ▲ Reduced ink consumption from 70% to 60% of ink-tank capacity.\n\n- ▲ Reduced delay until start of ink recovery after using Toxic Mist by 25/60 of a second.\n\n- ▼ Reduced the effect time from 7 seconds to 5 seconds.\n\n- ▼ Reduced the Ink Saver (Sub) effect by roughly 14%.\n\n- ▲ The sound effect for Toxic Mist will now be played again when an opponent enters the affected area.\n\n- — Made it easier to hear the sound effects when it detonates.\n\n- ▲ Adjusted the sound effect caused when an opponent enters the area of effect of Toxic Mist, making it easier to distinguish if they are nearby or far away.\n\n- ▲ Added effect that forces the amount of ink consumed for an opponent using a dualie-type weapon and performing a dodge roll while inside Toxic Mist to be multiplied by 3.5.\n\n- ▲ This will now effect[sic] opponent's Ballers.\n\nThe movement of any opponent who enters the mist will be slowed and their ink tank will slowly drain.\n\nThe longer the time spent in the mist, the stronger the effect.\n\n- Toxic Mist promotional image.\n\n- An Inkling throwing the Toxic Mist.\n\n- The radius of fog created by the Toxic Mist.\n\n- Toxic Mist as it appears in Octo Canyon.\n\n- Toxic Mist mem cake.\n\nToxic Mist returns in Splatoon 3, functioning the same as it did previously.\n\nToxic Mist appears in Side Order as the base sub weapon of Shiver's Palette.
