    "Toxic Mist is a sub weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3. It is a thrown bottle that, on impact, releases a toxic cloud that slows and drains the ink of any enemies within it.",
    "When thrown, Toxic Mist surrounds a circular area in fog. Opponents caught in the fog move more slowly and gradually lose ink.",
    "Players that stay in the fog for a long time are more severely affected.[1] It takes about 8.33 seconds for Toxic Mist to deplete a full ink tank, even with the high-capacity ink tank that comes with the Splattershot Jr. The fog remains on the stage for about 5.13 seconds before dissipating. Prior to Version 5.2.0, players in a Baller were immune to Toxic Mist.[2] Dualies that perform a dodge roll while they are in Toxic Mist use up 3.5 times the ink.[3]",
    "Sub Power Up increases throwing range and air travel velocity for Toxic Mist.",
    "In the Octo Canyon levels Octoling Assault and Octoling Workout, Toxic Mist appears as a stationary obstacle. This version of Toxic Mist appears as a bottle similar to the version thrown as a sub weapon, which activates when Agent 4 approaches it, creating a sphere of mist surrounding it. Unlike the sub-weapon version of Toxic Mist, this version does not dissipate over time, only disappearing when the bottle in the center of the mist is destroyed by ink.",
