Its appearance is similar to that of a Splatana Stamper. When used, ring-shaped holograms manifest around the lower base of the of the Splatana.\n\nThe Order Splatana is a weapon unlocked in Side Order, and is part of Frye's Palette. Its base set consists of Fizzy Bombs and Crab Tank. However, this can be changed in the Spire of Order by using a vending machine.\n\nIt has lower stats in comparison to the Splatana Stamper, with a slower swing rate, strafe speed, ink efficiency, ink coverage, range, and charge time, but has higher projectile damage. However, this can be upgraded through color chips in the Spire of Order.\n\n- The clear screen for the Order Splatana\n\n- The fail screen for the Order Splatana\n\n- A different angle of the clear screen displaying the holographic design"
