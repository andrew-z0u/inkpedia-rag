    "The Charcoal Decavitator is a main weapon in Splatoon 3. It is a Neo-branded variant of the Mint Decavitator.",
    "The Charcoal Decavitator appears broadly similar to its base weapon, the Mint Decavitator, but with coloration differences. Most of the white and blue elements of the base weapon are now an extremely dark navy and gold, respectively. Additionally, the bristles of the toothbrush alternate purple and yellow, and the pull trigger and lower trim of the handle are gold instead of gray. The clear plastic of the sheath is also dark-tinted, and the wordmark has different colors.",
    "The Charcoal Decavitator was announced as part of Sizzle Season 2024 and was released on 1 June 2024. Its kit is Splash Wall and Inkjet.",
    "- A different kit for this weapon was released on the same date: the Mint Decavitator, which is actually the original variant, with Charcoal Decavitator being the second.",

    "- The Charcoal Decavitator and Custom Wellstring V are the only second weapon loadouts in the Splatoon series to be released at the same time as their original variants.",
    "- The Charcoal Decavitator is one of the few weapons for which it is not apparent by its name that it is the second kit released for that weapon. Some other weapons that share this distinction are the New Squiffer, Light Tetra Dualies, Nautilus 79, and the Snipewriter 5B.",
    "- The label on both sides of the sheath features large text that is the same regardless of the weapon variant. However, a second smaller text located just bottom right the large text changes depending on the weapon variant, meaning that the text on the label actually indicates the name of the weapon and its variant.\nKnowing this, the label on Mint Decavitator would say “mint”, and the one on Charcoal Decavitator would say “sumi”, referring to the original Japanese names of the weapons.",
    "- The Charcoal Decavitator and its variants are the only melee-like weapons in the Splatoon series (including both splatanas and brushes-class weapons) which attacks by swinging the weapon to the right first by pressing the  button.\nOtherwise, all splatanas and brushes swing to the left first.",
    "Charcoal is a reference to charcoal toothpaste which contains activated charcoal. Decavitator comes from \"de-\" + \"cavity\", as toothbrushes are used to prevent tooth cavities. It is also a play on decapitation, or the act of separating the head and body (for example, with a sword)."
