    "The Mint Decavitator is a main weapon in Splatoon 3, manufactured by Neo. It is a splatana with an integrated sheath that allows for a wide range of slashes, at the cost of being unable to perform vertical movements.",
    "The Mint Decavitator is a splatana that performs wide and powerful slashes. Its distinctive features are its very long lunge distance, similar to the Grizzco Splatana from Salmon Run Next Wave; and the absence of vertical slashes. Both normal and charged slashes are horizontal, with the charged slash being wider, more powerful, and with slightly more range. Finally, the range at which a charged slash is lethal is relatively long, as the weapon's “blade” can extend during an animation that occurs when the  button is released.",
    "The Mint Decavitator is a weapon that combines aspects of a katana and an oversized electric toothbrush contained within a large, clear plastic sheath. The toothbrush has five clusters of bristles arranged in a line that alternate between blue and teal, adorned with a blob of striped toothpaste dispensed from a reservoir in the handle (alternating stripes of white and the wielder's ink color), as well as a white handle with blue trim, a pull trigger, and what appear to be three LEDs on its front. The sheath has a blue hinged cap at its tip, a ring handle, and three slotted openings towards its distal end. A Neo logo can also be seen on the handle of the toothbrush, and an unknown wordmark on the outside of the sheath.",
    "When performing uncharged slashes, the toothbrush remains inside the sheath, but during a charged slash the wielder will draw the toothbrush to perform an iaijutsu-style slash before re-sheathing it.",
    "The Mint Decavitator was announced on 12 May 2024 during the Sizzle Season 2024 trailer and was released on 1 June 2024. Its kit is Suction Bomb and Big Bubbler.",

    "The Mint Decavitator is a splatana with an extra-wide attack. You won't believe how much ink you fling with every swipe! Especially charged swipes! They can leave you open, but that's easily worth being able to close distance quickly while inking a wide swath. The key to a successful charge attack is maintaining space between you and your foes. The Suction Bomb sub weapon can help with that! And with the Big Bubbler special, you can toss out ink with those juicy swipes or hold strategic points from the safety of your bubble. For best results, apply consistent, even strokes across the battlefield. Celebratory flossing optional!",

    "Mint is a common flavoring for toothpaste. Decavitator comes from \"de-\" + \"cavity\", as toothbrushes are used to prevent tooth cavities. It is also a play on \"decapitation\", or the act of separating the head and body (for example, with a sword).",
