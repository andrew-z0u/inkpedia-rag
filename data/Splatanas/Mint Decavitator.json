Its distinctive features are its very long lunge distance, similar to the Grizzco Splatana from Salmon Run Next Wave; and the absence of vertical slashes. Both normal and charged slashes are horizontal, with the charged slash being wider, more powerful, and with slightly more range. Finally, the range at which a charged slash is lethal is relatively long, as the weapon's “blade” can extend during an animation that occurs when the  button is released.\n\nThe Mint Decavitator is a weapon that combines aspects of a katana and an oversized electric toothbrush contained within a large, clear plastic sheath. The toothbrush has five clusters of bristles arranged in a line that alternate between blue and teal, adorned with a blob of striped toothpaste dispensed from a reservoir in the handle (alternating stripes of white and the wielder's ink color), as well as a white handle with blue trim, a pull trigger, and what appear to be three LEDs on its front. The sheath has a blue hinged cap at its tip, a ring handle, and three slotted openings towards its distal end. A Neo logo can also be seen on the handle of the toothbrush, and an unknown wordmark on the outside of the sheath.\n\nWhen performing uncharged slashes, the toothbrush remains inside the sheath, but during a charged slash the wielder will draw the toothbrush to perform an iaijutsu-style slash before re-sheathing it.\n\nThe Mint Decavitator was announced on 12 May 2024 during the Sizzle Season 2024 trailer and was released on 1 June 2024. Its kit is Suction Bomb and Big Bubbler.\n\n- An alternative kit for this weapon was released on the same date: the Charcoal Decavitator, but Mint Decavitator is the original variant.\n\n- The Mint Decavitator is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 15.

The center hitbox has a radius of 0.3 units, and the edge hitboxes have a radius of 0.25 units. The hitboxes cover a total width of 2.9 units.\n\n- The projectile travels at 2.3 units per frame for 6 frames and spawns 1.4 units in front of the user, combining for a total distance of 15.5 units.\n\n- The blade hitbox extends about 3.9 units in front of the user, and about 1.8 units to either side of the user.\n\n- The time between continuous slashes is 30 frames.\n\n- The user can submerge in ink 27 frames after the slash starts.\n\n- The blade hitbox appears 9 frames after the slash starts, and the projectile appears 12 frames after the slash starts.\n\n- The ink consumption of 13% per slash allows the user to slash 7 times per ink tank.\n\n- After slashing, there is a 50 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- While charging or slashing, the user's speed is set to 0.055 units per frame.\n\n- The projectile of the slash deals 80 damage, and the blade itself deals 160 damage, for a combined total of 240 damage.\n\n- The projectile hitbox consists of 7 smaller hitboxes that become larger the closer they are to the center of the projectile.

You won't believe how much ink you fling with every swipe! Especially charged swipes! They can leave you open, but that's easily worth being able to close distance quickly while inking a wide swath. The key to a successful charge attack is maintaining space between you and your foes. The Suction Bomb sub weapon can help with that! And with the Big Bubbler special, you can toss out ink with those juicy swipes or hold strategic points from the safety of your bubble. For best results, apply consistent, even strokes across the battlefield.

Some other weapons that share this distinction are the Classic Squiffer, Dark Tetra Dualies, Nautilus 47, and the Snipewriter 5H.\n\n- The label on both sides of the sheath features large text that is the same regardless of the weapon variant. However, a second smaller text located just bottom right the large text changes depending on the weapon variant, meaning that the text on the label actually indicates the name of the weapon and its variant.\nKnowing this, the label on Mint Decavitator would say “mint”, and the one on Charcoal Decavitator would say “sumi”, referring to the original Japanese names of the weapons.\n\n- Knowing this, the label on Mint Decavitator would say “mint”, and the one on Charcoal Decavitator would say “sumi”, referring to the original Japanese names of the weapons.\n\n- The Mint Decavitator and its variants are the only melee-like weapons in the Splatoon series (including both splatanas and brushes-class weapons) which attacks by swinging the weapon to the right first by pressing the  button.\nOtherwise, all splatanas and brushes swing to the left first.\n\n- Otherwise, all splatanas and brushes swing to the left first.\n\n- Knowing this, the label on Mint Decavitator would say “mint”, and the one on Charcoal Decavitator would say “sumi”, referring to the original Japanese names of the weapons.\n\n- Otherwise, all splatanas and brushes swing to the left first.\n\nMint is a common flavoring for toothpaste. Decavitator comes from \"de-\" + \"cavity\", as toothbrushes are used to prevent tooth cavities. It is also a play on \"decapitation\", or the act of separating the head and body (for example, with a sword)."
