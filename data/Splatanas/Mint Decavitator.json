    "The Mint Decavitator is a main weapon in Splatoon 3, manufactured by Neo. It is a splatana with an integrated sheath that allows for a wide range of slashes, at the cost of being unable to perform vertical movements.",
    "The Mint Decavitator is a splatana that performs wide and powerful slashes. Its distinctive features are its very long lunge distance, similar to the Grizzco Splatana from Salmon Run Next Wave; and the absence of vertical slashes. Both normal and charged slashes are horizontal, with the charged slash being wider, more powerful, and with slightly more range. Finally, the range at which a charged slash is lethal is relatively long, as the weapon's “blade” can extend during an animation that occurs when the  button is released.",
    "The Mint Decavitator is a weapon that combines aspects of a katana and an oversized electric toothbrush contained within a large, clear plastic sheath. The toothbrush has five clusters of bristles arranged in a line that alternate between blue and teal, adorned with a blob of striped toothpaste dispensed from a reservoir in the handle (alternating stripes of white and the wielder's ink color), as well as a white handle with blue trim, a pull trigger, and what appear to be three LEDs on its front. The sheath has a blue hinged cap at its tip, a ring handle, and three slotted openings towards its distal end. A Neo logo can also be seen on the handle of the toothbrush, and an unknown wordmark on the outside of the sheath.",
    "When performing uncharged slashes, the toothbrush remains inside the sheath, but during a charged slash the wielder will draw the toothbrush to perform an iaijutsu-style slash before re-sheathing it.",
    "The Mint Decavitator was announced on 12 May 2024 during the Sizzle Season 2024 trailer and was released on 1 June 2024. Its kit is Suction Bomb and Big Bubbler.",
    "- An alternative kit for this weapon was released on the same date: the Charcoal Decavitator, but Mint Decavitator is the original variant.",

    "- The Mint Decavitator and Wellstring V are the only two weapons in the Splatoon series where both the new weapon and their second kit got released in the same update.",
    "- The Mint Decavitator is one of the few weapons for which it is not apparent by its name that it is the first kit released for that weapon. Some other weapons that share this distinction are the Classic Squiffer, Dark Tetra Dualies, Nautilus 47, and the Snipewriter 5H.",
    "- The label on both sides of the sheath features large text that is the same regardless of the weapon variant. However, a second smaller text located just bottom right the large text changes depending on the weapon variant, meaning that the text on the label actually indicates the name of the weapon and its variant.\nKnowing this, the label on Mint Decavitator would say “mint”, and the one on Charcoal Decavitator would say “sumi”, referring to the original Japanese names of the weapons.",
    "- The Mint Decavitator and its variants are the only melee-like weapons in the Splatoon series (including both splatanas and brushes-class weapons) which attacks by swinging the weapon to the right first by pressing the  button.\nOtherwise, all splatanas and brushes swing to the left first.",
    "Mint is a common flavoring for toothpaste. Decavitator comes from \"de-\" + \"cavity\", as toothbrushes are used to prevent tooth cavities. It is also a play on \"decapitation\", or the act of separating the head and body (for example, with a sword)."
