    "Splatanas are one of the main weapon classes in the Splatoon series.",
    "Splatanas are sword-like weapons that send horizontal blades of ink flying with each slash of the weapon. They are also capable of charging to perform a higher-damage slash.",
    "Splatanas were first introduced in Splatoon 3.",
    "As a charging-type weapon class, splatanas will make use of not only basic slashes with repeated taps of , but also the higher-powered charge slashes when holding .",
    "All slashes produce both an ink projectile as well as a close-ranged melee hitbox. The charged slash possesses not only higher damage on its ink projectile, but also extreme damage capable of a one-hit splat on its melee hitbox. To increase the efficacy of this attack, splatanas are also capable of performing a quick forward lunge before attacking on the ground by releasing a charge while holding .",
    "Note: The series are arranged by their respective order in the weapon select screen with the Main filter.",
    "The following splatana(s) are only available outside of battles as part of other modes:",
    "Spawner pose:",
    "- All styles: Points the weapon forward at a downward angle, gripping the handle with both hands in a stance with their left foot forward.",
    "Victory:",
    "- Flip Out: Jumps and slams the weapon into the ground point-first, then lands and leans against it with their arms and legs folded.",
    "- Reppin' Inkopolis: Twirls the weapon around with a smile before putting it down point-first with a hand on their hip. (Added in version 7.0.0. Versions prior used the same animation as Flip Out.)",
    "- The Square Show-Off: Swings the weapon like a charged swing before smiling with a pose.",

    "- If the player charges the splatana while holding it in their left hand after firing, the weapon will be held on the left side and in a slightly different way than when held on the right side.\nThe exception to this is the Mint Decavitator and its variant, which are always held on the left while charging.\nWhile most weapons which are held on one side of the body or the other, such as chargers and shooters, will spawn their projectiles from the corresponding position relative to the player, splatana slashes will always spawn in the center of the player's view regardless of how the weapon is held.",
    "- While the slashes splatanas send out appear visually as single beam-like objects, they actually consist of multiple spherical hitboxes in arc-like formations.\nAs a result, a single splatana slash can deal damage to things with multiple hitboxes (such as both the shield and weak point on a Big Bubbler, or both a Crab Tank and the player riding it) multiple times.",
    "- The lunge attack of the splatana class uses the same code as the dodge-rolls found among the dualie weapon class, with their parameters even specifying that they can only perform the maneuver once.",
    "- Like other weapons with charge mechanics, the code for splatanas does have support for them being able to store a charge. It is however, never used.",
    "Splatana is a portmanteau of \"splat\" and \"katana\"."
