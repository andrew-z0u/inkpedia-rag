    "The Splatana Stamper Nouveau, formerly known as the Neo Splatana Stamper,[note 1] is a main weapon in Splatoon 3. It is the Nouveau-branded version of the Splatana Stamper, with identical stats.",
    "The Splatana Stamper Nouveau is similar to the appearance of the Splatana Stamper, except the base, which is white with a green strip along the handle. The date-wheel is also green, and the metal chassis has a sticker bearing the Nouveau logo.",
    "The Splatana Stamper Nouveau was first revealed in the Chill Season 2023 announcement trailer on 15 November 2023, and was released on 1 December 2023 as part of the new season's content. Its kit consists of Toxic Mist and Crab Tank.",

    "- The Splatana Stamper Nouveau is the first new weapon with Crab Tank to be added since the launch of Splatoon 3.",
    "- The Splatana Stamper Nouveau is the only weapon to have its name changed significantly (unlike the Octo Shot which only had a space added to it), and the first weapon to have its name changed between versions of the same game (unlike the Octo Shot which was changed between Splatoon and Splatoon 2), due to the previous name erroneously referencing the wrong brand."
