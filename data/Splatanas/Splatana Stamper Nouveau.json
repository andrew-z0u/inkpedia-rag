Don't believe me? Imagine you're caught in some Toxic Mist, and the other team comes in and splats you instantly with a charged slash. Only that's what YOU can do to THEM! Not to mention the Crab Tank special, which is a total game changer. Now you've got the splatana for up-close-and-personal fighting and the Crab Tank to strike from afar. Formidable! If you like splatanas but wish you had a longer range, give this set a try! Once you master the sub and special, this set can be really... special. It's so nice I said it twice!\n\n- Promotional render\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Splatana Stamper Nouveau.\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Splatana_Stamper_Nouveau_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nModel of the Splatana Stamper Nouveau rotating (link to file)\n\n- The Splatana Stamper Nouveau is the first new weapon with Crab Tank to be added since the launch of Splatoon 3.\n\n- The Splatana Stamper Nouveau is the only weapon to have its name changed significantly (unlike the Octo Shot which only had a space added to it), and the first weapon to have its name changed between versions of the same game (unlike the Octo Shot which was changed between Splatoon and Splatoon 2), due to the previous name erroneously referencing the wrong brand."
