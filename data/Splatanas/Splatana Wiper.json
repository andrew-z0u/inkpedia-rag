    "The Splatana Wiper is a main weapon in Splatoon 3, made by Deco.",
    "The Splatana Wiper resembles a car windshield wiper with what appears to be a long yellow sponge as the \"blade\" and a hilt of a badminton racket. A thin length of coiled and bent metal joins the base of the hilt and the lower end of the wiper blade to form a handguard",
    "The Splatana Wiper was revealed in the Splatoon 3 Direct on 10 August 2022. It has Torpedo and Ultra Stamp. Pressing  allows for quick horizontal slashes that fire ink, but holding the button will charge it for a more powerful vertical slash, which can instantly splat opponents at close range.",
    "The splatana's projectiles are perfectly accurate, even when jumping, and the weapon has a very fast strafe-speed while performing uncharged slashes - though unaffected by Run Speed Up - which combined with its ability to ink long lines quickly, make it a very mobile weapon.",
    "Moving forward while firing the charged shot will allow the player to lunge forward a short distance, which will also delay the slash until the end of the lunge. The player cannot lunge after jumping.",
    "Both forms of slashes from the Splatana Wiper have multiple segments, like the Splatana Stamper's relatively larger slashes, however due to the smaller size hitting something with the middle segment is much easier. In practice, this means that a slash's arc is more likely to be stopped on any impact.",
    "The Splatana Wiper can do a series of horizontal slashes extremely quickly unlike the Splatana Stamper and the Decavitator.",

    "- The Splatana Wiper was one of the weapons that were available to use in the Splatoon 3 Splatfest World Premiere.\nIt is the only weapon in the splatana class featured in this event.",
    "- The Splatana Wiper is one of only two weapons introduced at the game's launch to not appear in any of the missions in Return of the Mammalians, with the other being the REEF-LUX 450.",
    "- When charging toward a vertical slash with the Splatana Wiper, the blade fiddles in place.",
    "- When doing the Splatana and Torpedo trials in Judd's trials, the player is equipped with the Splatana Wiper.",
    "- This weapon's sub and special weapon were both introduced in Splatoon 2's version 4.2.0.",
    "- The 3D icon of the Splatana Wiper depicts what appears to be an early model of the weapon rather than using the finalized design; it is mildly simpler in appearance and lacks a sponge as the blade.",
    "Splatana is a portmanteau of \"splat\" and \"katana\" and Wiper references the weapon's resemblance to a car wiper."
