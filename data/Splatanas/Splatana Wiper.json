A thin length of coiled and bent metal joins the base of the hilt and the lower end of the wiper blade to form a handguard\n\nThe Splatana Wiper was revealed in the Splatoon 3 Direct on 10 August 2022. It has Torpedo and Ultra Stamp. Pressing  allows for quick horizontal slashes that fire ink, but holding the button will charge it for a more powerful vertical slash, which can instantly splat opponents at close range.\n\nThe splatana's projectiles are perfectly accurate, even when jumping, and the weapon has a very fast strafe-speed while performing uncharged slashes - though unaffected by Run Speed Up - which combined with its ability to ink long lines quickly, make it a very mobile weapon.\n\nMoving forward while firing the charged shot will allow the player to lunge forward a short distance, which will also delay the slash until the end of the lunge. The player cannot lunge after jumping.\n\nBoth forms of slashes from the Splatana Wiper have multiple segments, like the Splatana Stamper's relatively larger slashes, however due to the smaller size hitting something with the middle segment is much easier. In practice, this means that a slash's arc is more likely to be stopped on any impact.\n\nThe Splatana Wiper can do a series of horizontal slashes extremely quickly unlike the Splatana Stamper and the Decavitator.\n\n- The Splatana Wiper is a lightweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 13. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The Splatana Wiper fires projectiles as it swings.\n\n- The Splatana Wiper can lunge forward if the user performs a charge slash while moving forward on the ground.\n\n- The Splatana Wiper cannot store its charge.\n\n- The ink consumption of 3% per slash allows the user to slash 33 times per ink tank.\n\n- After slashing, there is a 30 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- While slashing, the user's speed is set to 0.0945 units per frame.\n\n- The projectile of the slash deals 30 damage, and the blade itself deals 15 damage, for a combined total of 45 damage.\n\n- The projectile hitbox consists of 3 smaller hitboxes that become larger the closer they are to the center of the projectile. The center hitbox has a radius of 0.3 units, and the edge hitboxes have a radius of 0.3 units. The hitboxes cover a total width of 2 units.\n\n- The projectile travels at 3.3 units per frame for 4 frames and spawns 1.4 units in front of the user, combining for a total distance of 14.9 units.\n\n- The blade hitbox extends about 2.7 units in front of the user, and about 1.2 units to either side of the user.\n\n- The time between continuous slashes is 16 frames.\n\n- The user can submerge in ink 15 frames after the slash starts.\n\n- The blade hitbox appears 3 frames after the slash starts, and the projectile appears 6 frames after the slash starts.\n\n- The ink consumption of 6% per slash allows the user to slash 16 times per ink tank.\n\n- After slashing, there is a 30 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- While charging or slashing, the user's speed is set to 0.0945 units per frame.\n\n- The projectile of the slash deals 60 damage, and the blade itself deals 120 damage, for a combined total of 180 damage.\n\n- The projectile hitbox consists of 7 smaller hitboxes that become larger the closer they are to the center of the projectile. The center hitbox has a radius of 0.5 units, and the edge hitboxes have a radius of 0.3 units. The hitboxes cover a total height of 3 units.\n\n- The projectile travels at 1.2 units per frame for 14 frames and spawns 0.8 units in front of the user, combining for a total distance of 18.1 units.\n\n- The blade hitbox extends about 3.3 units in front of the user, and about 0.25 units to either side of the user.\n\n- It takes 14 frames to fully charge the weapon.\nIf the user is out of ink, then it takes 42 frames to fully charge the weapon.\n\n- If the user is out of ink, then it takes 42 frames to fully charge the weapon.\n\n- The swing animation lasts for 22 frames.\n\n- The blade hitbox appears 3 frames after the slash starts, and the projectile appears 6 frames after the slash starts.\n\n- Lunges cover a distance of 2.0 units.\n\n- After 4 frames of startup, the lunge lasts for 3 frames. The blade hitbox appears after 14 frames, and the projectile appears after 17 frames.\nThe total animation lasts for 33 frames, after which the weapon can be used again.\nThe user can submerge in ink 22 frames after the animation starts.\n\n- The total animation lasts for 33 frames, after which the weapon can be used again.\n\n- The user can submerge in ink 22 frames after the animation starts.\n\n- If the user is out of ink, then it takes 42 frames to fully charge the weapon.\n\n- The total animation lasts for 33 frames, after which the weapon can be used again.\n\n- The user can submerge in ink 22 frames after the animation starts.\n\n[1][2]\n\n- ▲ The width of the ink launched by horizontal slashes has been increased by about 27%: 1.6 units → 2 units.\n\n- ▲ The size of terrain area inked by falling spray has been increased, and it is easier to connect ink in an uninterrupted straight line.\n\n- ▼ Points to fill special gauge: 180 → 190\n\n- — Fixed an issue that made other players using a Splatana Wiper appear to have ink in their weapon to everyone else, even if they were out of ink.\n\n- ▲ Reduced the charge time required to do a charge swipe by approximately 1/30th of a second: 16 frames → 14 frames\n\nThe Splatana Wiper is part of an entirely new category of weapons known as splatanas! These sword-like slashers can fling ink through the power of centrifugal force. To do a basic horizontal slash, just press . But you can also hold  to unleash a vertical slash that will really send some ink flying! On top of that, if you perform a vertical slash while tilting  a bit forward, you'll step forward with the attack, adding enough power to flatten most foes. Paired with the Torpedo sub, you can slash across the battlefield and level your enemies with a single stroke. It's almost too good! And I haven't even mentioned the Ultra Stamp special yet. If the other team hasn't surrendered, the Ultra Stamp is sure to make 'em think twice. If you want to be among the first trailblazers in the splatana-fighting genre, this set is for you!\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- The Splatana Wiper being swung\n\n- 3D artwork of an Inkling using the Splatana Wiper.\n\n- The Splatana Wiper in Splatoon 3 Direct.\n\n- Range of normal blow\n\n- Range of charge blow\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- Held by the Octoling on the left.\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Splatana Wiper.\n\n- Unused early version of the Splatana Wiper's Tableturf Battle card.
