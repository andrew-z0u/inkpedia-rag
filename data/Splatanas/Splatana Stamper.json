    "The Splatana Stamper is a main weapon in Splatoon 3, made by Nouveau.",
    "The Splatana Stamper resembles a chainsaw and elongated wheeled date stamp. Inside the metal chassis is a date wheel, attached by a tri-wing screw. The wheel rotates a line of square stamps to form a serrated blade. Each stamp has a square script character; these are written in alphabetical order. At the bottom of the chassis is an embossed square script label resembling a product serial, and attached is a holdable navy ink tank with the Nouveau logo printed on.",
    "The Splatana Stamper was revealed after the Splatoon 3 Direct on 10 August 2022 in promotional images. Nintendo first officially mentioned the weapon in its splatana weapon class Tweet on 12 August 2022. Pressing  allows quick slashes that fire ink, but holding it will charge it for a more powerful slash, which can instantly splat opponents at close range. Its kit consists of Burst Bombs and Zipcaster.",
