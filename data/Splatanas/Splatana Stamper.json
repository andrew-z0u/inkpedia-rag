Inside the metal chassis is a date wheel, attached by a tri-wing screw. The wheel rotates a line of square stamps to form a serrated blade. Each stamp has a square script character; these are written in alphabetical order. At the bottom of the chassis is an embossed square script label resembling a product serial, and attached is a holdable navy ink tank with the Nouveau logo printed on.\n\nThe Splatana Stamper was revealed after the Splatoon 3 Direct on 10 August 2022 in promotional images.

Now, this weapon takes a bit longer to charge than the Splatana Wiper, but the trade-off is a wider, more powerful spray of ink. It can really do some damage! Give this a try: fire off a charged slash, and follow it quickly with a horizontal slash or Burst Bombs. Not sure what they call a one-two punch in swordplay, but this is it! And with the Zipcaster special, you're practically buckling swashes! Er, swashBUCKLING. What I mean to say is you're basically a laser space pirate with elite space-pirate tech!\n\n- An Octoling with the Splatana Stamper throwing a Burst Bomb.\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Splatana Stamper.\n\n- Concept art from The Art of Splatoon 3 of an inkling wearing Shiver's amiibo gear holding a Splatana Stamper.\n\n- Artwork from Koshien 2023\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Splatana_Stamper_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nModel of the Splatana Stamper rotating (link to file)\n\nFor competitive tips about the Splatana Stamper\n\n- The Splatana Stamper's design was inspired by a date stamp provided by Nintendo to developers upon joining.[4]\n\n- When attacking with the Splatana Stamper, the stamps on the wheel rotate.
