It's just painted to look that way by Barazushi! Underestimate this weapon at your own risk, especially paired with Curling Bombs that allow the user to quickly advance before taking out foes with a charged slash. And for those just out of range? Let the Trizooka special be your great equalizer. This set really lets the Splatana Wiper shine, despite its appearance.
