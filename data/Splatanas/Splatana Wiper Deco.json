    "What's the Splatana Wiper Deco and how is it different from a Splatana Wiper, you ask? Well, it's got a new look! And more significantly, an all-new loadout. Now you can use this lightweight weapon to splash a path to the front lines, where you can place Squid Beakons to rally the team. Once you've all hit your marks, fire up the Tenta Missiles special to scope out enemy positions and start tearing things up.
