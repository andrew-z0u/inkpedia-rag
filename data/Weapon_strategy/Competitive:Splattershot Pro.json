    "Gear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.",
    "The Splattershot Pro is one of many weapons to benefit highly from Damage Up, allowing the weapon to splat slightly damaged opponents with one less hit than normal - two rather than three.",
    "It's also worth noting that more Damage Up must be used in order to counteract the effects of Defense Up.",
    "Swim Speed Up is a versatile ability that can be proven useful in many different situations and for a multitude of different playstyles. Using Swim Speed Up allows a Splattershot Pro user to quickly access key areas of the map, maintain a safe distance from shorter ranged opponents, and overall easily maneuver in their own ink, making their movement more unpredictable and making the user harder to splat.",
    "The Splattershot Pro is the second-most ink hungry shooter in Splatoon (with the first being the .96 Gal), consuming 1.9% of the user's ink tank per shot. Equipping Ink Saver (Main) ensures that the user will have their main weapon readily available, such as after throwing bombs or when being rushed down by an enemy, increasing their survivability and allowing them to maintain pressure on their foes for longer.",
    "The Splattershot Pro outranges the majority of short to mid range shooters. In order to capitalize on this, a Splattershot Pro user might use bombs to either lure opponents into their range and make them easier to splat, force opponents away and out of combat, or straight up splat them - whether that be finishing them off with the splash damage or with the direct hit. Bomb Range Up increases the range that the user's Splat Bomb can be thrown, increasing its versatility and allowing it to be used in conjunction much more easily with the main weapon.",
    "One of the Splattershot Pro's main downsides is its relatively poor and inconsistent ink coverage. This combined with its relatively slow movement speed while firing (0.50 DU/f) means that a Pro user will likely find themselves in enemy ink. Ink Resistance Up increases movement in enemy ink and reduces the damage that the user will take, making it easier to navigate through enemy territory.",

    "Gear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.",
    "The Splattershot Pro through its various iterations has been a mainstay throughout the Splatoon series. Possessing both good range and damage, the Pro usually finds itself playing a slayer role, and this kit emphasizes that. The Crab Tank can rack up kills when used correctly, and surprisingly the Angle Shooter can be used to finish off damaged opponents. All in all, expect to do some splatting with this gun.",
    "Slayer is the name of the game",
    "The Splattershot Pro has good range and damage, but several other weapons surpass one or both of these capabilities. Depending on your weapon, use these facts to your advantage.",
    "Gear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.",
    "The Pro chews through ink like a bad printer. Ink Saver Main is probably the best of the three, and two mains of it aren't unreasonable. You could probably stack enough ink saver sub to throw out three angle shooters on a single tank, but the slots you need for that would probably be better spent elsewhere.",
    "It's a nice addition if you want to get Crab Tank faster and more frequently. Also helps that as of writing this, the special cost of the Pro is relatively cheap.",
    "Arguably not as powerful as Special Charge Up, but still helps by increasing Crab Tank duration, and durability.",
    "A useful ability for any weapon. Two subs will increase the swim speed to match a lightweight such as the Splattershot Jr.\n[4]",
    "The Splattershot Pro has 6 degrees of shot deviation while jumping. One main of this will reduce this by roughly 33%, to 3.99 degrees.[4] Not only does this help out in general, but it also assists against H-3 Nozzlenoses and Squeezers, which have similar ranges, but perfect accuracy while on the ground.",
    "The Splattershot Pro has bad painting around the player's feet, so it may get stuck in enemy ink more frequently, which can sometimes be a death sentence. Also, this ability has good stacking, so one or two subs is a good investment for better mobility through enemy ink.[4]",
    "Another useful ability for any weapon, having one sub will massively cut down the startup time for a Super Jump. Just watch out for enemy chargers and splatlings if you don't have stealth jump or drop roller.[4]",
    "While not as potent as it was in Splatoon, it can still be pretty useful in some situations, like when you make a trade (and you meet the numerous conditions for activation)",
    "Has some utility for lessening the cost of death, but not all that game changing.",
    "The Splattershot Pro is a slayer, which will often need to jump back into the action. With many chargers around in the current meta, having this ability will hide the Super Jump marker from them to avoid being camped.",
    "Respawn Punisher is a double-edged sword. If you're running this, make sure you get at least get more kills than deaths, otherwise, you're making things harder for yourself.",
    "You don't have bombs, so object shredder might be a nice way to compensate for that fact, but that main slot would probably be better used somewhere else.",
    "To be added.",
    "- A minimum of 24 ability points or eight subs of Damage Up will reach the damage cap of 49.9 HP per hit.[1]",
    "- 19 ability points, or a pure of Damage Up will deal 48.7 HP per hit, splatting any opponent who takes more than 2.6 HP of damage in two hits.[2]",
    "- 45 ability points (three mains and five subs) worth of Damage Up will reach the 49.9 damage cap to an opponent with one main ability of Defense Up.[3]",
    "- 6 ability points – two subs – of Swim Speed Up will increase the player's swim speed from 1.92 to 2.02 DU/f.",
    "- 10 ability points – or one main – will increase it further from 1.92 to 2.08 DU/f.",
    "- 10 ability points - one main - will let the user fire 60 shots per ink tank rather than the typical 52.",
    "- Primarily, three main points make the Pro a good slayer; good range, good damage, and good accuracy.\nAt 3 hits to splat and an okay fire rate, the Pro puts out some surprisingly decent damage. While overshadowed by many weapons in terms of time to kill, it is still good when combined with:\nIts excellent range. Particularly for the shooter class, it's one of the best. You'll be outranging a lot of close to mid-range weapons like the regular Splattershot, the .52 Gal, Splat Dualies, the Blaster, etc.\nThat being said, the Splattershot Pro is not helpless at close-range and can hold its own up close if the situation calls for it.\nThe Pro has great accuracy as well, meaning it can kill consistently even at its maximum effective range.",
    "- The Splattershot Pro is not a terrible turfing weapon per se, but it will be outpaced in this regard by quite a few weapons. Still it can cover up a Splat Zone decently enough, for example.",
    "- A Pro vs. Pro matchup will usually come down to skill, and whoever gets the initiative on the other. Remember, if another pro (or any other weapon for that matter) gets the jump on you, retreat is always an option. Just be sure to not get gunned down while running away.\nWhen confronting a Pro and other similarly ranged weapons, flanking and ambushing are good tools for safely picking them off.",
    "- Remember that shooting gives away your position. Sometimes it's better to simply hide in ink and wait for the enemies to come to you before picking them off, so try not to shoot willy-nilly.",
    "- Focus fire, as in go after one enemy at a time. If you're going down, better to take one enemy down with you than partially damage two.",
    "- The Angle Shooter can be used to finish off already damaged opponents. In fact it has a better range than the Splattershot Pro, so if an opponent is fleeing from you, you can throw out an Angle Shooter to try to finish them off.\nOf course, the Angle Shooter can also be used to mark out opponents for you and your team, which is always helpful.\nThe Angle Shooter is a relatively cheap sub, so you might as well throw one out. Just don't go crazy with it though, otherwise you might find yourself low on ink in a tight spot.\nNote that the Angle Shooter is thrown out slightly below your aiming reticle. Remember to take that into account when aiming quickly.\nThe Angle Shooter comes out instantly (or near instantly), which makes it pretty handy in a lot of cases.",
    "- The Crab Tank is great for racking up kills with its main cannon. It's also great for holding, and attacking objectives. You aren't invincible in it though, and don't forget to watch your back.\nNote that rolling away is a good way to get out of danger with the Crab Tank. You aren't very fast, but your vulnerable rear hitbox is covered up, so you might have enough protection to roll away to safety, but it really depends on the situation. Also you can't super jump when the crab tank is active.\nDO NOT use the Crab Tank as a panic button, the days of instantly deploying Bubblers and Krakens are long gone. The Crab Tank takes a bit to activate, so you may just be shot down before you can even fight back.\nThe Pro's Crab Tank is cheaper then the Forge Pro's Booyah Bomb, so you'll generally be getting it more often.",

    "- The Splattershot Pro can team up with shorter-range high-damage weapons. The Pro can deal with longer-range enemies while the short-range weapon can deal with enemies up close.",
    "- The Pro can also help out long-range teammates by stopping any rushes aimed against them.\nAnchor weapons also provide generally safe super jump spots and long-range fire support, so keep that in mind.",
    "- Big Bubblers and Tacticoolers are always helpful, the latter of which will drastically reduce the penalty of dying. The former can provide protection against long-range weapons.",
    "- Anchor weapons also provide generally safe super jump spots and long-range fire support, so keep that in mind.",
    "- High-damage weapons like the .52 Gal can easily outshoot the Pro if allowed to get into range. If you have a weapon with a faster kill time but shorter range than the pro, try to get the Pro into your range when it is safe to do so.\nEven weapons with relativity low damage and range like the Inkbrush can still deal with the Splattershot Pro by ambushing, so keep that in mind.\nDo not rush a Splattershot Pro head-on. It may not shred you like a Hydra Splatling, but it is enough to dispatch you easily.",
    "- The Hydra Splatling and Heavy Splatling both have better range, damage, and accuracy than the Splattershot Pro. Keep this in mind and pick off any pick off any Splattershot Pro users before they can get into range.\nThe Ballpoint Splatling also beats the Pro out in terms of accuracy and range, though it has a slower time to kill at long range when compared to the Heavy and Hydra. Keep in mind you can always use close-range firing mode when possible, it will eviscerate the Pro up close.",
    "- Likewise the Splat Charger and the E-liter 4K have much better range than the Pro. Keep the Splattershot Pro from getting into range, and pick them off whenever possible.",
    "- The Splattershot Pro has no good way to deal with splash walls (lack of bombs, average maneuverability, no way to shoot around), use it to provide protection against its shots.",
    "- In general, bombs are a good way to put pressure on long-range weapon users by forcing them to reposition. Any time the Pro isn't shooting is time you can use by advancing in on them and attacking.",
    "- The Squeezer and the H-3 Nozzlenose both have exponentially better accuracy than the Pro, giving them an advantage in one on one fights.",
    "- The Range Blaster has comparable range, but its splash damage and one hit direct make it a dangerous opponent for the Pro.",
    "- The Nautilus has comparable range, but has higher accuracy and damage output than the Pro, making it particularly troublesome for the Pro.",
    "- Even weapons with relativity low damage and range like the Inkbrush can still deal with the Splattershot Pro by ambushing, so keep that in mind.",
    "- Do not rush a Splattershot Pro head-on. It may not shred you like a Hydra Splatling, but it is enough to dispatch you easily.",
