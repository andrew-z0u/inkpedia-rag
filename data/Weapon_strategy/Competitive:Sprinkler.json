Otherwise, it still serves the same purpose it served in the original Splatoon: automatic turfing, temporary shielding, and distraction of opponents.\n\nWhile not as versatile as bombs, the Sprinkler can still provide its user some utility:\n\n- First, it constantly spreads ink around its immediate area, maintaining turf control on highly contested areas:\nLike a Suction Bomb, it can attach to any surface it is thrown onto. A Sprinkler placed high on a wall or ceiling is usually harder for an opponent to destroy than one on the ground.\nStarting from version 4.5.0, it immediately places a sizable spot of ink around its base (if the surface is inkable). This allows users of slow-firing weapons, such as the Explosher and the Kensa Dynamo Roller, to maintain friendly turf beneath their feet.[2]\nIt can used by users of shorter-ranged weapons, such as the Permanent Inkbrush, to turf areas that are either out of their reach or unsafe to approach.\nA Sprinkler will continue to operate until it is destroyed or its user either places another one or gets splatted.\nAfter attaching to a surface, the Sprinkler takes 30 frames (0.5 seconds) to deploy before transitioning through three phases:\n\n- Like a Suction Bomb, it can attach to any surface it is thrown onto.

A team with lethal bombs in its composition has many advantages over another team that has no lethal bombs:[4]\n\n- Their one-hit-splat offers its user's team chances of instantly gaining a numbers advantage, from which a game-winning push can arise.\n\n- Their lethal explosion provides space for its user's team to either push into an area held by the opponent or stall an opponent's push.\n\nWhile not as versatile as bombs, the Sprinkler can be used in a few ways to support your teammates:\n\n- Placing a Sprinkler in a strategically important area can help your team maintain control of it. Its destruction by the opponent might serve as a warning of their presence.\n\n- If you have a teammate who wields a slow-firing, ink-guzzling weapon and tends to remain in one area, then consider dropping a Sprinkler nearby them to provide them both a temporary shield and friendly turf within which to retreat and reload their ink tank.\n\nWhile an opponent's Sprinkler might not be as threatening as their bombs, it can still help them maintain map control and provide a layer of protection.\n\n- A player with Object Shredder can destroy most opponents' objects, such as Sprinklers, with one shot. Rapid-firing weapons can do this more quickly and efficiently.\n\n- If an opponent's Sprinkler is present nearby, make sure that no opponents are hiding nearby before attempting to destroy it.\n\n- If an opponent throws a Sprinkler towards you, attempt to splat the opponent first whenever possible since doing so will also remove their Sprinkler."
