    "Gear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.\nEditor note:\nThis guide is for all abilities, to avoid conflict and to be more useful for everyone.\nPlease do not remove any ability that was added. You may add reasoning for why other abilities are more strategically desirable. If an opinion is questionable, discuss its content on the talk page. \nIf you believe that an ability is particularly good, it would be best if you added a citation to support your opinion. Citations to Top 500 or tournament winning players are best.",
    "Damage Up is an incredibly useful ability for an L-3 Nozzlenose user, allowing them to splat slightly damaged opponents with three hits rather than four. A user who lands all three shots on an opponent will still not splat them, and - due to the 8 frame lag between each burst - might be splatted themselves before they can land another hit. Damage Up will highly increase the chance of splatting an opponent with only one burst, even if they take the tiniest amount of damage, making an L-3 user's splatting ability much more attainable.",
    "- 16 ability points, one main and two subs, will deal 32.99 damage per hit, dealing 99 damage per burst.",
    "- 18 ability points of Damage Up, or six subs, will reach the damage cap of 33.3HP per bullet.[1]",
    "It is also worth noting that more Damage Up must be used in order to counter the effects of Defense Up.",
    "- 34 ability points or one main and eight subs of Damage Up is enough to meet the 33.3 damage threshold against opponents with 1 main of Defense Up.[2]",
    "Swim Speed Up can be proven to be quite useful to an L-3 Nozzlenose D user, allowing them to access key areas of the map faster, flee dangerous situations quickly, and close down on an opponent.",
    "- 6 ability points – two subs – of Swim Speed Up will increase the player's swim speed from 1.92 to 2.02 DU/f.",
    "- 10 ability points – or one main – will increase it further from 1.92 to 2.08 DU/f.",
    "- The L-3 Nozzlenose is a unique, medium ranged slayer's weapon with some supportive tendencies[5], thanks to its various abilities.\nIt has more range than a number of other slayer's weapons, such as the Splattershot, the Splat Dualies, and the Splash-o-matic, allowing it to zone out many opposing slayers in a one-on-one and both shark and turf from a safer distance.\nThe ink coverage of the L-3 Nozzlenose is very efficient for turfing, which helps maintain map control and quickly build up the special gauge.\nIts mobility, particularly while firing, is amazing for a middleweight weapon, outpacing the Splattershot Pro, the Splattershot, even the Splash-o-matic. Run Speed Up can further increase this mobility, making its user a more difficult target to hit while firing.\nMain Power Up can increase its damage per shot, maxing out at 33.3 with 24 ability points - about two mains and one sub - as of version 5.1.0.\nComeback, Quick Respawn, and Stealth Jump are abilities that each encourage aggressive play for a slayer.",
    "- As a burst-fire shooter, the L-3 Nozzlenose requires a higher level of skill than an automatic shooter to be effective:\nIts user must be more accurate with aiming, due to the delay between bursts.\nA user of any burst-fire shooter has to be able to lead shots in order to maximize the damage per burst.",
    "- While the Curling Bomb is not as versatile as other bombs, it still has a variety of uses:\nWhen it travels along any inkable non-vertical surface, it leaves a trail of ink behind, providing a quick avenue to either attack or escape.\nKeep opponents guessing by sending Curling Bombs towards the opponent without swimming in its trail. Either Ninja Squid or swimming slowly can help avoid detection while swimming in the ink trail.\nIt further assists the main weapon in turfing from a safe distance.\nWhen charged, or \"cooked\" long enough, it can be used to lay insidious bomb traps to hold off pursuers or flush out sharks.\nParticularly in narrow or closed areas, a Curling Bomb ricocheting off of walls can be a useful distraction to force an opponent to move in a certain direction.",
    "- The Baller is a versatile special weapon with a variety of uses:\nTaking control of a certain area of the stage, such as a Splat Zone or underneath the opponents' Clam basket.\nForcing the opponents to clear an area, whether leading a Tower or Rainmaker push or stopping one.\nProviding its user an extra layer of protection, such as when fleeing an unsafe situation or while riding the Tower at a checkpoint. In the latter case, be wary of getting knocked off of the Tower by the opponents' weapons.\nAfter the Baller's explosion, nearby opponents not splatted are often damaged enough for one or two hits from the main weapon to splat them.",
    "- Because of the versatility of the L-3 Nozzlenose, each of the many slayer's and support weapons each have to approach a matchup against it in a different manner:\nOne-on-one matchups between L-3 Nozzlenoses on opposing teams are decided by the players' skill, positioning, turf control, and assistance from teammates.\nTry to confront an opposing L-3 Nozzlenose in a more open area, as the opponent's Curling Bombs would be more troublesome in a closed, narrower area.\nThe L-3 Nozzlenose outranges and outmaneuvers many typical slayer's weapons, such as the Splattershot and the Splash-o-matic, so they would be at a disadvantage in a straight one-on-one. Careful flanking or sharking and better positioning and tactical use of bombs are more effective than brute force.\nThe Splattershot Pro easily outranges the L-3 Nozzlenose but is outmaneuvered by it due to its relatively slow running speed while firing. Try to zone out the L-3 Nozzlenose and watch both the ink tank and the surrounding turf because the Splattershot Pro is also weaker in both ink efficiency and turfing as well.\nMid- to long-ranged support weapons are often the best bet against the L-3 Nozzlenose. The .96 Gal, the H-3 Nozzlenose, and the Dualie Squelchers all outrange the L-3 Nozzlenose, and the latter also outmaneuvers it (through dodge rolling).\nBrellas can pose a problem for the L-3 Nozzlenose due to the latter's lag between bursts, but beware the L-3 Nozzlenose's mobility.",
    "- Any long-ranged weapon, such as a charger or most splatlings, can attack an L-3 Nozzlenose with impunity as long as the former can maintain a safe distance.",
    "- To avoid falling victim to a sharking L-3 Nozzlenose, always keep track of all four opponents - which ones are still active, which ones are splatted, and which ones Super Jumped back to their spawn point - and turf suspicious puddles of opposing ink, preferably with a sub weapon.\nAny sub weapons that can track opponents not only discourage sharking but also make marked opponents easier targets for a long-ranged teammate.",
    "- If an opponent's Curling Bomb travels nearby, immediately turf the trail it leaves behind to both cut off lanes of attack and flush out any opponents.",
    "- When attacked by an opponent's Baller, if possible, concentrate fire on the Baller – especially with bombs – to quickly destroy it and prevent its explosion.",
    "- If an opponent riding the Tower activates Baller, attack it at a proper angle – away from the Tower's stake – to knock it off of the Tower.",
    "- Splashdown can destroy a Baller if executed before the Baller initiates its explosion. The Baller's user will remain unsplatted, so prepare a follow-up attack.",
    "Gear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.",
    "Increases main weapon damage up to 33.3 per shot. The L-3 Nozzlenose is a weapon that has a close potential for a three hit splat, or a one hit splat per  if the opponent has touched enemy ink for at least one frame.",
    "- 24 ability points – achievable with either eight subs or one main and five subs – are enough to reach the L-3 Nozzlenose's damage cap of 33.3 HP.[6]",
    "- For a smaller but nearly-effective investment, 16 ability points – reached with six subs, or one main and two subs – are enough to exceed 32 HP of damage, while 6 ability points – just two subs – will exceed 30 HP.[6]",
    "Increases running speed, particularly while firing.",
    "Super Jumping to a teammate after respawning carries the risk of getting splatted upon landing, due to the appearance of a Super Jump indicator. When equipped, Stealth Jump better covers this indicator from long distance opponents, allowing its user to more safely return to the front lines and maintain pressure on the opponent.",
