  "content": "The Painbrush Nouveau is a weapon that was introduced in Chill Season 2023 as a variant of the Painbrush. Like the original version, this weapon has the ability to fling ink and slide across a stage and can pose a threat at a distance unlike other brushes. It can be considered as a support due to its kit allowing to regularly locate the opponents, via the included Point Sensors and the good Tenta Missiles farming.\n\n- 1 Splatoon 3\n\n1.1 Use\n1.2 Synergy\n1.3 Countermeasures\n1.4 Gear abilities[1]\n\n- 1.1 Use\n\n- 1.2 Synergy\n\n- 1.3 Countermeasures\n\n- 1.4 Gear abilities[1]\n\n- 2 References\n\n- 1.1 Use\n\n- 1.2 Synergy\n\n- 1.3 Countermeasures\n\n- 1.4 Gear abilities[1]\n\nLike the original Painbrush, the Painbrush Nouveau is a brush that has two main mechanics: flinging ink and sliding, with high damage and range, but with slower movements than other brushes.\n\nThis weapon can be a good way to farm and regularly use Tenta Missiles, which can be useful for supporting your team while disrupting the opposing team.\n\n- Tenta Missiles can be used in order to temporarily locate enemies and force them to move from their position.\n\n- The detection aspect of the Tenta Missiles can be reinforced using Point Sensor, but this consumes a certain amount of ink: Painbrush being a weapon that consumes a lot of ink, its sub weapon must be used wisely.\n\n- Because the Painbrush Nouveau is a slow weapon with high damage, it is good to sneak up on players whilst distracted or injured, as they may take too long to fight back.\n\n- Painbrush Nouveau's range is equivalent to that of a Splattershot Jr. which should be kept in mind when fighting opponents.\n\n- The Painbrush Nouveau's range, high damage and its Tenta Missiles makes it good for popping the Rainmaker's shield.\n\n- The weapon can be somewhat effective for attacking targets at height or behind an obstacle, as it can still deal damage while its shots are falling (albeit less).\n\n- The Painbrush Nouveau consumes a lot of ink, so keep an eye on it when the user uses the Point Sensors repeatedly or attacks constantly: it may be wise to attack him while the weapon recharges its ink.\n\n- The Painbrush Nouveau's reaction is also very slow; if a player wields a quicker weapon, they'll have a higher chance at survival compared to a slower weapon.\n\n- The Painbrush takes a long time to start rolling, because of the windup; if a Painbrush is trying to back away and run, that is one of the best times to attempt to splat it.\n\n- When the Painbrush begins swinging, its strafing speed is extremely slow. Backline weapons should try to attack it, such as weapons like the E-liter 4K or its scoped variant; the brush will be an easy splat.\n\n- If the Painbrush Nouveau user uses Tenta Missiles too randomly, this can leave them vulnerable for a few moments: attacking them with a weapon that has decent range can be effective without putting yourself in danger.\n\nHelp farming Tenta Missiles.\n\nHelps combat the main weapon's low ink efficiency.\n\nIncreases mobility. Also allows you to move into other parts of the map quickly to help with things like objective and enemy control.\n\nAllows for being more aggressive without risk of wasting time in case of an attack failure.\n\nAllows for being more aggressive without risk of wasting time in case of an attack failure. Extends the detection duration and casting range of the Point Sensor. Not required but occasionally useful.\n\nMakes it easier to sneak up on enemies, and also allows you to move into sharking positions without being noticed.\n\nStealth Jump helps with stealth, will help prevent immediate attacks upon landing from a Super Jump, as the Painbrush has a long windup time before it can swing and cannot defend itself easily."
