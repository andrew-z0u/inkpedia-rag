    "Gear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.",
    "The Rapid Blaster Deco is a midrange slayer weapon with good range and damage. Its sub weapon, Torpedo, can be used for mobility, combos, and locating enemies. Its special weapon, Inkjet, is a good offensive option which can be used to get rid of opponents from a safe distance.",
    "The Torpedo has the infamous combo. Despite the physics being different from other Sub weapons the Main and Sub combo pretty well. However, there is the downside of the needing to hit a direct in order to combo with the Torpedo.",
    "As mentioned before the Main and Sub combo pretty well. The Torpedo and Inkjet can be used to find foes who are hiding."
