Thus, it can easily be rushed by faster opponents without being given a chance to flee or fight back.\n\n- Mobile weapons like shooters should be able to quickly close down a Tenta Camo Brella user within their range.\n\n- Throwing a bomb at a Tenta Camo Brella user's feet will force them to reposition, giving you time to chase them down and finish them off.\n\nDespite the Tenta Camo Brella's shield being extremely durable, it still has a few weaknesses:\n\n- If an opponent is standing near the shield, throwing a bomb at it will cause it to instantly implode and splat them.\n\n(TBA)"
