    "Inkstrike allows the player to launch a missile to any point on the map by using the GamePad. It causes the map on the GamePad to flatten, and showing a prompt on the TV screen saying: \" Touch To Aim!\". If the player does not chose a place to fire the Inkstrike, it is launched directly on top of the user.",

    "Swimming away would probably be the best option, or if you know who has an Inkstrike then you could splat them before they activate it."
