    "Like the Berry Splattershot Pro of Splatoon and the Kensa Splattershot Pro of Splatoon 2, the Splattershot Pro FRZ-N is the third variant of the Splattershot Pro unique to Splatoon 3, debuting with the Splatlands Collection released in version 10.0.0 on 12 June 2025. Like all previous variants the weapon, it has a lower fire rate, reduced turfing, higher ink consumption, and less mobility than a Splattershot in exchange for higher damage, range, and accuracy.[1][2]",
    "In addition to receiving the same buffs in damage, ground accuracy, and turfing given to its two other variants in previous versions of Splatoon 3, the Splattershot Pro FRZ-N has a weapon set that provides great utility and encourages a more fluid playstyle, allowing it to contribute more within a team composition.[1]",
    "With all-around performance, good damage per second (DPS), medium range, and a valuable special, the Splattershot Pro FRZ-N is best classified as a crossfire utility weapon:[4]",
    "- Its high damage, increased since version 7.2.0, combos with various other weapons, including Burst Bomb direct hitsâ€”even if an opponent has one secondary ability or sub, equal to three ability points (AP), of Sub Resistance Up.[5]",
    "- Its range allows its user to both zone out and apply distance pressure to shorter-ranged opponents.",
    "- Its ground accuracy, improved since version 9.2.0, makes it more reliable at splatting opponents within its range.",
    "- As a \"Jack of all trades\", it can seamlessly fill in for roles when a teammate is temporarily unavailable (e.g., splatted).",
    "Like previous variants, the Splattershot Pro FRZ-N has a few weaknesses that offset its strengths:[2]",
    "- Its slower fire rate leaves it vulnerable to more rapid-firing weapons should an opponent get too close, usually through flanking or sharking.",
    "- Its turfing is spotty at best (even after receiving a buff in version 4.1.0), not as capable of helping poor-turfing teammates (such as blasters) move about as are more efficient turfing weapons, such as the Splattershot.",
    "- It has lower ink efficiency than a Splattershot, consuming more than twice the ink per shot. This leads to longer downtime and fewer opportunities to use Splat Bombs.",
    "- Its strafing speed while shooting is comparatively slow, not only worsening its issues with flankers and sharks (see above) but leaving its user more vulnerable to getting sniped by longer-ranged opponents, such as chargers.",
    "- The tradeoff of being a \"Jack of all trades\" is its inability to excel at a specific role (i.e., \"master of none\"):\nIt lacks both a skirmisher's survival tools, such as a Splash Wall, needed to sustain fights and a slayer's mobility to quickly secure splats. Conversely, the Squeezer has longer range, faster strafing speed, and a Splash Wall.\nIts lacks the long range of an anchor to influence a large portion of the stage.\nWhile often slotted in place of a support, its turfing and special weapon output cannot match that of a true support.",
    "When used judiciously (due to the main weapon's comparatively high ink consumption), the Splat Bomb is a powerful, versatile weapon with a wide range of uses:",
    "- It is a quick area denial tool, capable of displacing opponents from their positions and punishing those who dare approach it.",
    "- It detonates on contact with certain opponents' objects (e.g., Splash Walls, Big Bubbler barriers, even Torpedoes) and the Rainmaker shield, not only inflicting high damage onto the object but also damaging or splatting any opponents caught in the blast.",
    "- Its explosion also turfs nearby surfaces, which is useful for both maintaining map control and building up the special gauge.",
    "Tenta Missiles can be used to locate and pressure opponents and force them out of position without having to commit too far forward:",
    "- It is recommended to only activate the Tenta Missiles at a safe distance from opponents, not only because a Tenta Missile user is vulnerable to close-range attacks but also because opponents who are further back are easier to track and home missiles on.",
    "- Sometimes, it may be more beneficial to target a specific opponent or two instead of all of them, based on their weapons, location, and situation:[6]\nOpponents wielding heavy, slow firing weapons will have a harder time escaping the missiles.\nOpponents who are bunched together are more likely to cause their teammates to receive collateral damage than those who are spread apart.\nTenta Missiles are also a reliable means of forcing opposing anchors to cede their ground and lose focus while aiming. Sometimes, this is the only reliable means to push back into a zone or another important area of the stage.\nTenta Missiles can counter an opponent's Booyah Bomb or Crab Tank if anticipated early enough; an opponent will be forced to either delay or interrupt it to avoid getting splatted by the missiles, throwing off their aim.",
    "The Splattershot Pro FRZ-N is not typically one of the first weapons added to a team composition but often the last one added to address any lingering issues with the first three. Both its inherent traits and weapon set provide valuable tools to round out many team compositions. As long as the rest of the team has enough turfing, a reliable skirmisher-slayer pair, and a dependable anchor who preferably provides Tacticooler, then the Splattershot Pro FRZ-N's issues will not be overly exposed:",
    "- If a team plans on running with a Tacticooler, then it is recommended to be provided by the anchor (or pseudo-anchor) at a consistent rate. The Snipewriter 5H, Heavy Edit Splatling, even the Clawz .96 Gal and the Dynamo Roller all fit these criteria.\nSkirmishers and Slayers are generally under higher risk of getting splatted due to their roles, so it is not recommended for them to be responsible for providing Tacticooler unless a team is running double Tacticooler.\nWhile the Rapid Blaster Pro WNT-R can play anchor, its Tacticooler output is limited due to its nature as a blaster to be the sole Tacticooler provider.\nAs a displacement special weapon, Tenta Missiles pair well with Tacticooler for pushing into opposing territory since the latter does not directly threaten the opponent.",
    "- The Splattershot Pro FRZ-N can combo with a variety of attacks, including a Burst Bomb direct hit (see above), a .96 Gal shot, a single charged Splatana slash or two tap slashes.",
    "- Avoid adding a Splattershot Pro FRZ-N to a team with poor turfing since it would not be able to mobilize its teammates without some help.",
    "While not typically the most threatening member of an opposing team, an opposing Splattershot Pro FRZ-N user is still a key player who ties the rest of their team together. Their damaging, accurate main weapon provides strong crossfire for pincer attacks, and their sub and special weapons are both reliable displacement tools. While they may not always be as capable a skirmisher or slayer, their weaknesses are subtle and only exposed through careful play:",
    "- Sub Resistance Up reduces the amount of damage taken from splash damage by Splat Bombs.[5]",
    "- Direct matchups between Splattershot Pro FRZ-N users on opposing teams are determined by each player's skill, positioning, turf control, and the presence of any teammates.",
    "- Shorter-ranged weapon users should rely more on flanking and sharking to confront an opposing Splattershot Pro FRZ-N user. However, be wary of any Splat Bombs they might drop in self-defense.",
    "- Users of ranged area of effect- (AoE-) style weapons (e.g., blasters, sloshers) can exploit cover and attack an opposing Splattershot Pro FRZ-N user from odd angles.",
    "- If you either have a brella or a Splash Wall, then use it to limit the range and movement of the opposing Splattershot Pro FRZ-N user, exploiting their low ink efficiency. Again, be wary of any Splat Bombs thrown your way.",
    "- Very mobile weapon users (such as dualies, some splatlings, and the REEF-LUX) can dodge the opposing Splattershot Pro FRZ-N user's shots to either extend confrontations or go in for the splat, exploiting the latter's slow strafing speed.",
    "- Users of chargers, most splatlings, and most stringers outrange an opposing Splattershot Pro FRZ-N user and can fire upon them with impunity if far enough.",
    "- Be mindful of both when the opponent has Tenta Missiles ready (via the head-up display) and when the missiles are launched:\nIf an opponent attempts to launch them when nearby you, splat them quickly to reduce or even cancel their deployment.\nWhen the opponent deploys their Tenta Missiles, avoid getting close to teammates - even when not targeted, as a targeted player crossing paths with a teammate might cause the other to get injured or splatted.\nWhenever targeted by opposing Tenta Missiles, unless actively engaging an opponent, only move enough to avoid damage and reduce the  Missiles' spatial impact.[7]",
    "Splattershot Pro FRZ-N users benefit from abilities that either enhance their ability to apply crossfire and support for their team or minimize their main weapon's weaknesses.",
    "While not expected to play as aggressively (and, thus, not as prone to getting splatted as often) as a skirmisher or slayer, a Splattershot Pro FRZ-N user can still greatly benefit from Comeback, which provides one primary ability or main, equal to 10 ability points (AP), each of six different gear abilities ( Ink Saver (Main),  Ink Saver (Sub),  Ink Recovery Up,  Run Speed Up,  Swim Speed Up, and  Special Charge Up) for 20 seconds after respawning (from getting splatted by an opponent):[5]",
    "While its effects are not as permanent as Last-Ditch Effort, Comeback includes  Special Charge Up and both mobility-based abilities as well as  Ink Recovery Up and both ink efficiency-based abilities, minimizing most of the main weapon's weaknesses.",
    "Every player is expected to come in contact with opposing ink on many surfaces, which can both be damaging and reduce mobility. Ink Resistance Up delays the time when damage is taken from contact with opposing ink and partially offsets the reduction in mobility, the latter trait being important whether pursuing or fleeing opponents.[5]",
    "The relatively low ink efficiency of the Splattershot Pro FRZ-N prevents its user from either using their Splat Bombs often or firing many shots after using one. Reducing the amount of ink consumed per shot will reduce the user's downtime:[5]",
    "While very accurate on the ground, the Splattershot Pro FRZ-N loses its accuracy whenever its user jumps. Intensify Action reduces the angle of the main weapon's shot spread while jumping, bringing it closer to the shot spread while on the ground (2.5Â°):[5]",
    "To preserve special gauge progress (if not a ready use of Tenta Missiles), a Splattershot Pro FRZ-N user needs to be able to flee unfavorable situations more quickly. Quick Super Jump shortens the lag time at the start of performing a Super Jump, not only improving their survival chances but also hastening their return to the front lines after respawning.[5]",
    "Tenta Missiles' value as a displacement special weapon makes it valuable to have ready to either initiate a push or stall an opponent's push. Special Charge Up can help a Splattershot Pro FRZ-N user offset the relatively slow turfing rate:[5]",
    "An essential ability for most players, Stealth Jump better covers the Super Jump landing marker from distant opponents, allowing a Splattershot Pro FRZ-N user to more safely return to the front lines and continue to provide crossfire and utility for their teammates.",
    "Whenever a Splattershot Pro FRZ-N user engages the opponent, they put themselves at risk from opposing bombs. Sub Resistance Up reduces the amount of damage taken from splash damage (but not direct hits) by lethal bombs and both direct hits and splash damage by nonlethal bombs, such as Burst Bombs:[5]",
    "To make up for their slow strafing speed while firing, a Splattershot Pro FRZ-N user can improve their mobility with Swim Speed Up, which makes them a harder target to hit and enables them to better zone out shorter-ranged opponents and more quickly close in on longer-ranged ones. They will also benefit while carrying the Rainmaker, a task often taken by the utility player of a team composition:[5]",
    "Carrying over its previous issues from the end of Splatoon 2, the Splattershot Pro series of weapons did not begin with a good competitive reputation due to its middling traits and the removal of main weapon damage increases from either Damage Up in Splatoon and Main Power Up in Splatoon 2. The Vanilla Splattershot Pro suffered even more at Splatoon 3's launch due to its underwhelming weapon set: a sub weapon in Angle Shooter that was less reliable than bombs at inflicting damage and a Crab Tank with a 200p special gaugeâ€”equal to that of the Splash-o-matic, which not only turfed more efficiently for higher special weapon output but dominated the early meta scene.[2][8] Thus, the Splattershot Pro was considered outclassed by other weapons with more maximized strengths and better defined roles. The Forge Splattershot Pro did not fare any better upon its debut in version 2.0.0 due to its high special gauge requirement of 210p, limiting its value in team compositions.[9]",
    "The perception of the Splattershot Pro series began to improve after its ink coverage was increased in version 4.1.0 and the special gauge requirement for each weapon was reduced (to 180p for the Vanilla variant by version 2.1.0 and to 200p for the Forge variant by version 6.1.0), allowing both variants to produce a reasonable amount of turf and special weapon output. However, neither weapon was considered higher than the upper middle tiers of the meta since other weapons still outclassed them.[10][11] Neither variant of the Splattershot Pro could easily challenge other medium-ranged weapons with longer range (e.g., Squeezer, Splatana Stamper), higher damage, or AoE (e.g., blasters, sloshers), which dominated the midline meta from version 6.0.0 to version 8.1.0.[12][13]",
    "To work around this issue, western competitive players began to view the Splattershot Pro series less as a main attacker and more as a utility or pseudo-support by version 9.3.0.[14] Its increased damage (since version 7.2.0) and improved ground accuracy (since version 9.2.0) made it more reliable at providing crossfire to assist frontline teammates. To further unlock its potential, it needed a reliably damaging sub weapon (absent in the Vanilla variant) and a less committal special weapon (unlike the Forge's Booyah Bomb). The arrival of the Splattershot Pro FRZ-N fulfilled both of these requisites and has seen a decent amount of use in the western competitive scene, achieving good results at tournaments following the release of version 10.0.0, such as SuperJump 5.[1][15]"
