  "content": "Like its Vanilla and Kensa variants, the Glooga Dualies Deco are dualies with the unique trait of increasing their range and damage after a dodge roll. The sub weapon of Splash Wall is extremely helpful to the weapon, letting it throw a Splash Wall and safely perform a roll to splat an opponent. The special weapon, Baller, can be useful in some situations, like helping the Rainmaker push forward by making a path, or capping a zone. However, using it to get out of a sticky situation can be risky since the Baller will usually get shredded very quickly.\n\nThe Glooga Dualies Deco are typically used as a slayer:\n\n- Being a dualie, the Glooga Dualies Deco possess the ability to dodge roll.\nThe dodge rolls are at a similar speed to those of the Splat Dualies. While the dodge rolls are not slow, they are not fast either, and should not be used without thought.\nAfter rolling, there is a long endlag where the player will be immobile for 42 frames, which can leave the user exposed to close-up enemies.\nWhile in turret mode, the Glooga Dualies Deco's range and damage are both increased, with the damage being able to splat opponents in two hits compared to the usual three.\nWith their long endlag and higher damage and range in turret mode, the Kensa Glooga Dualies' dodge rolls should not so much be used to avoid enemy fire, but instead to give themselves distance and splat opponents.\n\n- The dodge rolls are at a similar speed to those of the Splat Dualies.

to give themselves distance and splat opponents.\n\n- The Glooga Dualies Deco's range and damage after dodge-rolling can make them a real threat with their splatting power.\nTheir range allows the user to splat opponents with shorter ranged weapons such as the Neo Splash-o-matic and Kensa Splattershot without entering into their range.\nWhile they can already outrange opponents, the accuracy increase also allows the user to splat opponents more reliably.\nWhile opponents with longer range, such as the Kensa Splattershot Pro can still outrange the user, the Glooga Dualies Deco's dodge rolls can still be used to dodge attacks and be more mobile.\nThe high damage after dodge rolling splats opponents in two hits, allowing the user to quickly splat opponents.\nThe better accuracy and range of post-roll shots allow the user to win most fights against other two-shot opponents.\nWith 2 mains and 2 subs of Main Power Up, it is possible to splat an opponent with one turret mode shot and one normal shot, giving the user more flexibility in splatting opponents.[2]\n\n- Their range allows the user to splat opponents with shorter ranged weapons such as the Neo Splash-o-matic and

Be careful with dodge rolls to avoid being splatted by opponents.\nThe Glooga Dualies Deco's turfing capability is mediocre, making it difficult for the weapon to turf. Be careful of enemy ink to avoid getting trapped in it.\nTheir fire rate is slower than most other weapons. Keep a fair distance from most shorter ranged, faster fire rate opponents.\n\n- Their slow dodge rolls and long endlag will often leave the user exposed.

However, the Splash Wall can be deployed far more quickly, allowing its owner more time to reload ink or reposition themselves to a more favorable location.\n\n- If an opposing Brella user launches their shield, dropping a Splash Wall in front of it will cause both to negate one another, potentially denying a Rainmaker or Power Clam push.\n\n- At maximum, it takes 36-41% of the ink tank to launch a Brella shield and 60% to drop a Splash Wall.

However, a Splash Wall may still be placed onto the Tower to protect its user or their teammate while riding it. (Once again, watch out for the opponents' bombs.)\n\n- Refrain from either showering in or rushing through the wall until it is certain that the opponent has no bombs available in the area.\n\n- If an opposing Brella user launches their shield, dropping a Splash Wall in front of it will cause both to negate one another, potentially denying a Rainmaker or Power Clam push.\n\n- At maximum, it takes 36-41% of the ink tank to launch a Brella shield and 60% to drop a Splash Wall.
