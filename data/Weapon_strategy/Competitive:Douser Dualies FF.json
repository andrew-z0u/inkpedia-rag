  "content": "The Douser Dualies FF is a new weapon in the dualie class introduced in Splatoon 3. It has the longest range of any dualie, and compared to long-range shooters, it slightly outranges the Squeezer, but is just short of the Jet Squelcher. It can perform just one Dodge Roll at a time, and the distance rolled is further than other dualies. After rolling, the range is shorter, matching that of the Mini Splatling, but the fire rate, shot velocity and accuracy is increased drastically. Because of these qualities, the Douser Dualies FF finds itself positioned further back than most weapons, flexing between a support and a slayer-type role.[1][2][3][4]\n\n- The Douser Dualies FF's main strength is its range in its spread mode. Its strafing speed in this mode is slightly slower than the Splattershot, having good mobility considering its range. This mode should be used most of the time, which can pressure opponents at range, and provide long-range chip damage and turfing support for teammates. At 25.5 damage per shot, they will need 4 shots to splat an opponent.[2][4]\nIn this mode, the weapon outranges a large amount of weapons in the game, which can be used to the player's advantage. It is advised to stay in its most effective range, as its fall-off damage is poor.[2]\n\n- In this mode, the weapon outranges a large amount of weapons in the game, which can be used to the player's advantage. It is advised to stay in its most effective range, as its fall-off damage is poor.[2]\n\n- As it only has one Dodge Roll, this leaves little room for error. In general, its Dodge Rolls should be used sparingly and more strategically compared to the other dualies. The weapon's turret mode can be used for confirming close quarters splats, or as a defensive measure in response to being rushed down.[2]\nThe long Dodge Roll distance of the weapon can be used to pursue and splat fleeing opponents.[5]\nAlthough the range in turret mode is shorter, the range in this mode outranges a number of short-ranged weapons.[5]\n\n- The long Dodge Roll distance of the weapon can be used to pursue and splat fleeing opponents.[5]\n\n- Although the range in turret mode is shorter, the range in this mode outranges a number of short-ranged weapons.[5]\n\n- In this mode, the weapon outranges a large amount of weapons in the game, which can be used to the player's advantage.

They are ideal to place in high-traffic areas where the enemy is expected to go through. They combo with the weapon, inflicting anywhere from 35 to 45 damage to opponents while also marking them, meaning one less shot to splat an opponent.[2]\n\n- Killer Wail 5.1 has great synergy with the weapon. It is quick to activate, can finish off a damaged opponent, and can give the user an opportunity to move in with its Dodge Roll. Activating the special can also cancel the Dodge Roll's end-lag, essentially giving the user a second Dodge Roll. The special also acts as a quick ink tank refill, which helps mitigate its high ink consumption.[2]\n\n- The Douser Dualies FF favors stages with flat, open terrain, generally performing well on stages such as Crableg Capital, Barnacle & Dime, and Undertow Spillway:[6]\nOn Crableg Capital, the weapon can take advantage of the various uninkable grates as a movement option with its use of Run Speed Up.\nBarnacle & Dime has several areas the weapon can take advantage of, with some flat and open terrain in the middle and upper sides of the stage, as well as more enclosed, sloped areas which suit the weapon's Dodge Roll.\nUndertow Spillway favors the weapon's long range, featuring long and narrow routes. It is able to reach the enemy's snipe area from the middle of the stage, and is able to fire at enemies safely from the amount of high ground in the spawn areas. There are several spots to utilize the weapon's long Dodge Roll to catch opponents off guard, particularly around the pillar structures.\n\n- On Crableg Capital, the weapon can take advantage of the various uninkable grates as a movement option with its use of Run Speed Up.\n\n- Barnacle & Dime has several areas the weapon can take advantage of, with some flat and open terrain in the middle and upper sides of the stage, as well as more enclosed, sloped areas which suit the weapon's Dodge Roll.\n\n- Undertow Spillway favors the weapon's long range, featuring long and narrow routes.

Having only one Dodge Roll, which is recommended to use for scoring splats in combat or defending oneself from flankers, the weapon can be somewhat predictable in close matchups.\n\n- The weapon's paint is somewhat poor despite its range, meaning it's not too threatening passively.[7]\n\n- Baiting its Dodge Roll is always a good option, which leaves it more vulnerable.[7]\n\n- It's long-range mode has a slow time to splat, meaning taking fights with the weapon isn't too difficult, assuming it is in range.[7]\n\nGear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.\n\nSince the weapon's normal firing mode is used most of the time, this ability improves its strafing speed, also helping it to paint more effectively. 1 main is recommended.[1][8]\n\nA useful ability for any weapon to improve mobility. 2-3 subs are recommended.[8]\n\nThis ability works somewhat well on the weapon to improve its jump accuracy, as they can utilize dualie hopping more than the other dualies. 2-4 subs are recommended.[8]\n\nWhile this ability is often seen on more aggressive weapons, it is a good choice for the weapon, as the abilities it provides are extremely beneficial for it. This ability is also used in more aggressive builds.[3][8]\n\nA useful ability to have extra of, since Killer Wail 5.1 is able to cancel the Dodge Roll's end-lag, quickly refilling the ink tank in the process. 2-3 subs are recommended.[8]\n\n- In Version 9.3.0, the weapon's special points were reduced by 10, from 200 to 190. As a result, some have chosen to omit this ability in favor of other abilities, such as Sub Power Up and Special Power Up.\n\nWhile the weapon plays further back than most weapons, Stealth Jump is a great ability to have on almost any weapon.[8]\n\nOne sub of each are recommended as utility subs.[8]\n\nIf there is room in the build, one sub can be used, as it is a useful ability to have.[8]\n\nSince the weapon is more likely to fight at close range than other anchor weapons, this ability can be useful. Some choose to use the weapon more aggressively with its Dodge Roll, where Quick Respawn fits this playstyle.[1][3]\n\nCould be useful due to its low damage per shot.[1][8]\n\nCould be useful on Splat Zones.[8]\n\nCould be useful in Rainmaker or for fighting enemy Splash Walls due to its low object damage.[8]\n\nA niche option, but due to the weapon's high assist potential, along with the buff it received in Version 9.2.0, this ability has become increasingly viable on the weapon, enabling it to easily extend the ability's duration.[9]\n\nTo be added."
