  "content": "- 1 Splatoon 3\n\n- 2 Use\n\n- 3 Synergy\n\n- 4 Countermeasures\n\nKiller Wail 5.1 is a special weapon in Splatoon 3. Its name and function is based on the Killer Wail from Splatoon. It has some similarities to it, like global range.\n\n- Killer Wail 5.1 has six total lasers, launching two at a time, allowing you to target up to three opponents at once.\n\n- Killer Wail 5.1 is a long range displacement tool. It is used to move enemies out of certain areas.\n\n- Each laser doesn't deal a lot on its own, but aiming two or more sets of lasers on a single opponent can cause damage to be stacked up very quickly.\n\n- Killer Wail 5.1 is good at doing chip damage to help weapons.\nSplattershot Nova can easily combo with Wail to splat in four shots rather than five.\nRapid Blaster Pro Deco can use Wail to combo with its 85.0 damage direct.\nBamboozler 14 Mk I can use Wail to combo with its 85.0 damage at full charge.\nInkbrush can combo with Wail to splat in less swings, especially when not dealing the maximum damage.\nStarz Dynamo Roller can use Wail to increase its kill range.\nDouser Dualies FF can combo with Wail to splat in three shots rather than four.\nPatternz Undercover Brella can combo with Wail to splat in two shots rather than three.\nTri-Stringer can use Wail to enhance its chip damage capabilities.\n\n- Splattershot Nova can easily combo with Wail to splat in four shots rather than five.\n\n- Rapid Blaster Pro Deco can use Wail to combo with its 85.0 damage direct.\n\n- Bamboozler 14 Mk I can use Wail to combo with its 85.0 damage at full charge.\n\n- Inkbrush can combo with Wail to splat in less swings, especially when not dealing the maximum damage.\n\n- Starz Dynamo Roller can use Wail to increase its kill range.\n\n- Douser Dualies FF can combo with Wail to splat in three shots rather than four.\n\n- Patternz Undercover Brella can combo with Wail to splat in two shots rather than three.\n\n- Tri-Stringer can use Wail to enhance its chip damage capabilities.\n\n- Killer Wail 5.1 can help certain weapons with its displacement capabilities.\nNeo Sploosh-o-matic benefits from Wail's displacement due to its very short range.\n.52 Gal can benefit from Wail's displacement due to its relatively short range.\nSplattershot Nova benefits from Wail's displacement due to its vulnerability from its low damage and non-damaging sub.\nInkbrush benefits from Wail's displacement due to its very short range.\nDapple Dualies NOC-T benefits from Wail's displacement due to its short range.\nPatternz Undercover Brella benefits from Wail's displacement due to its relatively short range and vulnerability from its low damage despite the shield.\n\n- Neo Sploosh-o-matic benefits from Wail's displacement due to its very short range.\n\n- .52 Gal can benefit from Wail's displacement due to its relatively short range.\n\n- Splattershot Nova benefits from Wail's displacement due to its vulnerability from its low damage and non-damaging sub.\n\n- Inkbrush benefits from Wail's displacement due to its very short range.\n\n- Dapple Dualies NOC-T benefits from Wail's displacement due to its short range.\n\n- Patternz Undercover Brella benefits from Wail's displacement due to its relatively short range and vulnerability from its low damage despite the shield.\n\n- Splattershot Nova can easily combo with Wail to splat in four shots rather than five.\n\n- Rapid Blaster Pro Deco can use Wail to combo with its 85.0 damage direct.\n\n- Bamboozler 14 Mk I can use Wail to combo with its 85.0 damage at full charge.\n\n- Inkbrush can combo with Wail to splat in less swings, especially when not dealing the maximum damage.\n\n- Starz Dynamo Roller can use Wail to increase its kill range.\n\n- Douser Dualies FF can combo with Wail to splat in three shots rather than four.\n\n- Patternz Undercover Brella can combo with Wail to splat in two shots rather than three.\n\n- Tri-Stringer can use Wail to enhance its chip damage capabilities.\n\n- Neo Sploosh-o-matic benefits from Wail's displacement due to its very short range.\n\n- .52 Gal can benefit from Wail's displacement due to its relatively short range.\n\n- Splattershot Nova benefits from Wail's displacement due to its vulnerability from its low damage and non-damaging sub.\n\n- Inkbrush benefits from Wail's displacement due to its very short range.\n\n- Dapple Dualies NOC-T benefits from Wail's displacement due to its short range.\n\n- Patternz Undercover Brella benefits from Wail's displacement due to its relatively short range and vulnerability from its low damage despite the shield.\n\n- The way a Killer Wail 5.1 laser moves is very easy to manipulate as an opponent, as it just follows your path but it is slightly behind, even copying your exact speed.\nDue to this, it can be exploited to not displace you as much as other displacement specials would.\n\n- Due to this, it can be exploited to not displace you as much as other displacement specials would.\n\n- Squid Rolling through a set of lasers if you want to turn around can reduce the damage taken, due to Squid Rolls giving armor for a short period of time.\n\n- Depending on the weapons your opponents have, it may be worth it to tank a slight bit of damage when a laser is about to disappear to be displaced for less time.\n\n- Due to this, it can be exploited to not displace you as much as other displacement specials would."
