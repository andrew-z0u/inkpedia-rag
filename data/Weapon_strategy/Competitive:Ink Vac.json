    "The Ink Vac is a supportive special weapon in Splatoon 3. It is a vacuum that can suck up enemy ink and deflect it, which can help defend your team.",
    "The Ink Vac is known to suck up many projectile attacks and ink droplets, as well as some sub weapons and special weapons. There may be some exceptions, such as direct melee attacks (by splatanas or an Ultra Stamp) or devices that deal damage without directly using ink (such as lasers or shockwaves by Killer Wail 5.1 or Wave Breaker).\nThe table below lists what can and cannot be sucked up:",
    "The Ink Vac's suction vortex can also apply object damage to the following:",
    "- Brella shields",
    "- Sprinkler",
    "- Squid Beakon",
    "- Splash Wall",
    "- Wave Breaker",
    "- Big Bubbler",
    "- Super Chump decoys",
    "The Ink Vac may be used to help another teammate with a separate attack by helping to block attacks heading toward that person.",
    "Another synergy would be that it could be used to block ink from going to the opponent's Splat Zone. It could also be used as a extra defense for a full-team attack.",
    "- The Splatana, Roller, and Brush classes can use their melee attacks, which are not absorbed by the Ink Vac, to damage the user. Some special weapons, such as Reefslider, Zipcaster, and Ultra Stamp can damage and splat the Ink Vac user with direct damage.",
    "- Weapons with a high fire rate such as the Crab Tank's normal firing mode, the Hydra Splatling, and the Heavy Edit Splatling can fill up the Ink Vac and splat the user before they can fire the ink shot.",
    "- An Ink Vac user will not be protected if they are engulfed in a Booyah Bomb or Triple Inkstrike, although they are able to protect teammates who are.",
    "For much of the game's lifespan, Ink Vac was considered one of the weakest specials in the game. It wouldn't be until Version 4.1.0 that Ink Vac would be considered much more viable. In this update, the radius of the Ink Vac's ink shot was increased, allowing the Ink Vac to clear out a larger area and even instantly gain control of some Splat Zones. Furthermore, with the release of the Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau in Drizzle Season 2023, this variant of the Ballpoint Splatling would start to see use in some game modes such as Splat Zones and Rainmaker. Weapons such as the Jet Squelcher would also start to see more use."
