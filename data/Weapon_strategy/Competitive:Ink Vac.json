  "content": "The Ink Vac is a supportive special weapon in Splatoon 3. It is a vacuum that can suck up enemy ink and deflect it, which can help defend your team.\n\n- 1 Splatoon 3\n\n1.1 Use\n1.2 Synergy\n1.3 Countermeasures\n1.4 In competitive play\n\n- 1.1 Use\n\n- 1.2 Synergy\n\n- 1.3 Countermeasures\n\n- 1.4 In competitive play\n\n- 1.1 Use\n\n- 1.2 Synergy\n\n- 1.3 Countermeasures\n\n- 1.4 In competitive play\n\nThe Ink Vac is known to suck up many projectile attacks and ink droplets, as well as some sub weapons and special weapons. There may be some exceptions, such as direct melee attacks (by splatanas or an Ultra Stamp) or devices that deal damage without directly using ink (such as lasers or shockwaves by Killer Wail 5.1 or Wave Breaker).\nThe table below lists what can and cannot be sucked up:\n\nMain weapon\n\n- Any ink projectile from any weapon ('shots' from shooters, splatlings, chargers, stringers, etc., 'droplets' from rollers, brushes, explosions from stringer arrows, etc., or splatana projectiles)\n\n- Splatana's charged direct hit\n\n- Rolling roller\n\n- Sliding brush\n\n- Brella shields\n\n- Although they can hit the Ink Vac user by rolling/sliding, rollers and brushes are greatly slowed down by the Toxic Mist-like effect inside the vortex (more than just walking or swimming in front of it).\n\n- Brellas shields take damage over time while inside the Ink Vac's vortex.\n\nSub weapon\n\n- Splat Bomb\n\n- Suction Bomb\n\n- Burst Bomb\n\n- Fizzy Bomb\n\n- Curling Bomb\n\n- Autobomb\n\n- Angle Shooter\n\n- Point Sensor\n\n- Toxic Mist\n\n- Torpedo\n\n- Ink Mine explosion\n\n- Sprinkler droplets\n\n- Splash Wall barrier\n\n- Squid Beakon\n\n- Point Sensor effect area\n\n- Toxic Mist effect area\n\n- Angle Shooter line\n\n- Sprinkler\n\n- Splash Wall, Squid Beakon, and Sprinkler take damage over time while inside the Ink Vac's vortex.\n\nSpecial weapon\n\n- Trizooka shots\n\n- Tenta Missiles\n\n- Ink Storm device and ink from the rain cloud\n\n- Booyah Bomb ink ball and explosion\n\n- Ink Vac's ink shot\n\n- Inkjet shots and exhaust\n\n- Ultra Stamp when thrown and stamp attacks (indirect only)\n\n- Crab Tank shots\n\n- Reefslider explosion\n\n- Zipcaster explosions (indirect only)\n\n- Triple Inkstrike tornados\n\n- Kraken Royale's jump and charge attacks\nThe Ink Vac's vortex repels the Kraken Royale's attacks instead of sucking it in directly.\n\n- The Ink Vac's vortex repels the Kraken Royale's attacks instead of sucking it in directly.\n\n- Triple Splashdown explosions\n\n- Splattercolor Screen device\nThe screen slowly fills the Ink Vac; teammates who walk through the wall while in the suction vortex do not take damage but are still affected by the screen.\n\n- The screen slowly fills the Ink Vac; teammates who walk through the wall while in the suction vortex do not take damage but are still affected by the screen.\n\n- The Ink Vac's vortex repels the Kraken Royale's attacks instead of sucking it in directly.\n\n- The screen slowly fills the Ink Vac; teammates who walk through the wall while in the suction vortex do not take damage but are still affected by the screen.\n\n- Big Bubbler\n\n- Wave Breaker device and shockwaves\n\n- Killer Wail 5.1 lasers\n\n- Ultra Stamp direct stamp attack hit\n\n- Triple Inkstrike guidance devices and missiles\n\n- Tacticooler\n\n- Super Chump\n\n- Big Bubbler, Wave Breaker, and Super Chump decoys take damage when hit by the Ink Vac's vortex.\n\n- Reefslider, Zipcaster, and Ultra Stamp can damage and splat the Ink Vac user with direct hits.\nKraken Royale can too, but the Ink Vac's vortex tends to push it back, preventing it from approaching from the front.\n\n- Kraken Royale can too, but the Ink Vac's vortex tends to push it back, preventing it from approaching from the front.\n\n- Being inside a Booyah Bomb explosion or a Triple Inkstrike tornado will splat the Ink Vac user, but the Ink Vac will still get brielfy filled up before the user gets splatted.\n\n- Kraken Royale can too, but the Ink Vac's vortex tends to push it back, preventing it from approaching from the front.\n\nOther\n\n- Rainmaker shot and shield explosion\n\n- Fizzbang\n\n- Sprinkler of Doom\n\n- Rainmaker shield itself\n\n- Inkling/Octoling\nVacuuming an opponent will increase the Ink Vac's charge, but the player themselves will not receive damage. However, they will suffer similar effects to Toxic Mist, with a slowdown in movements and the emptying of their ink tank.\n\n- Vacuuming an opponent will increase the Ink Vac's charge, but the player themselves will not receive damage.

However, they will suffer similar effects to Toxic Mist, with a slowdown in movements and the emptying of their ink tank.\n\n-\n\nThe Ink Vac's suction vortex can also apply object damage to the following:\n\n- Brella shields\n\n- Sprinkler\n\n- Squid Beakon\n\n- Splash Wall\n\n- Wave Breaker\n\n- Big Bubbler\n\n- Super Chump decoys\n\nThe Ink Vac may be used to help another teammate with a separate attack by helping to block attacks heading toward that person.\n\nAnother synergy would be that it could be used to block ink from going to the opponent's Splat Zone. It could also be used as a extra defense for a full-team attack.\n\n- The Splatana, Roller, and Brush classes can use their melee attacks, which are not absorbed by the Ink Vac, to damage the user. Some special weapons, such as Reefslider, Zipcaster, and Ultra Stamp can damage and splat the Ink Vac user with direct damage.\n\n- Weapons with a high fire rate such as the Crab Tank's normal firing mode, the Hydra Splatling, and the Heavy Edit Splatling can fill up the Ink Vac and splat the user before they can fire the ink shot.\n\n- An Ink Vac user will not be protected if they are engulfed in a Booyah Bomb or Triple Inkstrike, although they are able to protect teammates who are.\n\nFor much of the game's lifespan, Ink Vac was considered one of the weakest specials in the game. It wouldn't be until Version 4.1.0 that Ink Vac would be considered much more viable. In this update, the radius of the Ink Vac's ink shot was increased, allowing the Ink Vac to clear out a larger area and even instantly gain control of some Splat Zones. Furthermore, with the release of the Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau in Drizzle Season 2023, this variant of the Ballpoint Splatling would start to see use in some game modes such as Splat Zones and Rainmaker. Weapons such as the Jet Squelcher would also start to see more use."
