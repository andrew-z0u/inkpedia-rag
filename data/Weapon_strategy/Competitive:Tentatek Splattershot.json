    "Like the Vanilla Splattershot, the Tentatek Splattershot (as well as the Octo Shot Replica) is an all-around, short-ranged shooter with a moderate fire rate, a three-shot-splat, good accuracy, and good mobility, capable of quickly splatting opponents and inking surfaces to maintain map control or farm its special weapon. In every game of the Splatoon series, it has been paired with a lethal bomb and a good special weapon, making it a popular pick among players of all skill levels.",
    "The Tentatek Splattershot is considered an all-around weapon thanks to its kit. The Suction Bomb is a strong area denial weapon, while the Inkzooka enables its user to splat opponents from long distance.[1] However, the very high special gauge requirement and the heavy special depletion penalty upon getting splatted mean that a Tentatek Splattershot user will usually have fewer opportunities to use their Inkzooka than other weapon users have to use their special weapons.[2]",
    "The Tentatek Splattershot is primarily a slayer but also has the tools to play supportively as well:",
    "Despite its many strengths, the Tentatek Splattershot still has a couple notable weaknesses its user has to account for:",
    "Suction Bombs can be used in a similar fashion to Splat Bombs, with a few differences:",
    "The Inkzooka is a special designed to splat opponents from a distance.",
    "The Tentatek Splattershot has great fire rate and damage, but its range can put the user at a disadvantage. Having too many short-ranged weapons on a team can put the team at a disadvantage for a few reasons.",
    "Gear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.",
    "Cold Blooded is an ability that shortens the duration of position-tracking to 50% of normal tracking time. As a stealthy, mobile weapon, Cold Blooded is immensely useful for the Tentatek Splattershot, enhancing its sneakiness, facilitating ambushes, preventing enemy ambushes, enabling more mobility, and preventing chargers from quickly splatting players.",
    "Comeback allows players to get back faster into the battle and constantly have a boosted range of abilities at hand, also making up and acting as a substitution for ability slots used for Quick Respawn. Quick Respawn allows you to get back faster into the battle after getting splatted and prevents lockouts or quick knockouts.",
    "As a short-range weapon, players will generally find themselves in enemy ink in engagements. The Ink Resistance Up ability allows players to continue to be mobile and to survive more fights without taking as much damage from enemy ink.",
    "The Swim Speed Up ability allows players to swim faster, which makes harder target to kill and much more mobility when moving in squid form. The Run Speed Up ability allows players to run faster, which makes harder target to kill and much more mobility when firing.",
    "The Tentatek Splattershot is a slayer's weapon, designed to splat an opponent in as few as three hits with its rapid firing, good accuracy, and short to medium range.",
    "The Splat Bomb is a versatile sub weapon with a variety of purposes suited for any slayer:",
    "If piloted properly, the Inkjet can pressure opponents – particularly anchors – more directly than most other slayer's special weapons, such as Tenta Missiles:",
    "The Tentatek Splattershot's versatility allows it to fit in almost any team composition. However, its Inkjet greatly benefits from a teammate's Ink Armor:",
    "Gear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.",
    "Unless a Tentatek Splattershot user is on an extended splatting streak, they can expect to get splatted often. When equipped, Comeback grants 10 ability points of six different stackable abilities for twenty seconds after respawning from getting splatted by an opponent:",
    "Ink Saver (Sub) and Swim Speed Up are the most useful for the Tentatek Splattershot wielder, allowing them to throw Splat Bombs more often and more quickly pursue and pressure the opponent upon returning from spawn.",
    "Main Power Up increases accuracy while either on the ground and while jumping.",
    "Quick Respawn shortens respawn time after getting splatted (under specific conditions), encouraging a Tentatek Splattershot user to remain aggressive even after getting splatted.",
    "Super Jumping to a teammate after respawning carries the risk of getting splatted upon landing, due to the appearance of a Super Jump indicator. When equipped, Stealth Jump better covers this indicator from long-distance opponents, allowing its user to more safely return to the front lines and maintain pressure on the opponent.",
    "Although Stealth Jump is the more popular choice, an excuse could be made for Drop Roller due to the ability working on Inkjet landings. This allows the user to potentially roll away from enemy fire, and also gives them a mobility boost for 3 seconds in the form of 10 AP of Run Speed Up, Swim Speed Up, and Ink Resistance Up.",

    "- Its good damage, good accuracy, and rapid fire rate make it very effective at quickly splatting opponents.",
    "- Its good mobility allows its user to apply pressure onto the opponent – whether head-on or through timely flanking – eliminating key defenders during a push.",
    "- Defensively, its rapid rate of fire makes it great at both sharking to pick off unaware opponents and turfing to maintain map control. Its good ink efficiency also allows its user to more readily use Suction Bombs to keep opponents at bay.",
    "- The accuracy of the Tentatek Splattershot (and most other shooters) is highest on its first shot, decreases the longer it is fired, and is restored shortly after it stops firing:\nThe chance of a shot fired (while on the ground) deviating at an angle (6 degrees) begins at 0% and increases by 2% with each consecutive shot, maxing out at 25%. When shooting stops for 6 frames, the chance of shot deviation returns to 0%.\nTherefore, to maintain optimal accuracy while engaged in a fight, fire in three-shot bursts (i.e., the minimum number of shots required to splat an opponent at full health) before repositioning (preferably by swimming or sub strafing), then fire another short burst before repositioning again, and repeat until the fight is over.",
    "- The Tentatek Splattershot is faster and more efficient at turfing than most other weapons, allowing its user to both maintain map control and build up the special gauge for its Inkzooka more quickly than most other weapons.",

    "- Its short range (2.3 marks in the test range) puts its user at a disadvantage against opponents with longer ranged weapons, such as sloshers (2.3-2.7 marks), the H-3 Nozzlenose (3.1 marks), the Range Blaster (2.6 marks for a direct hit), and the Mini Splatling (2.6 marks). Avoid head-on encounters against these opponents and instead rely more on flanking or sharking.",
    "- Its very high special gauge (220p) and heavy special depletion penalty upon getting splatted (75%) more than offset its rapid turfing. In contrast, the Wasabi Splattershot has a much lower special gauge requirement (180p) and a more reasonable special depletion penalty (60%).[2]",
    "- They can attach to surfaces, which both allows more room for error when aiming and enables the planting of craftier traps, such as underneath a grate.",
    "- They take two seconds after attaching to a surface to detonate, as opposed to one second for a Splat Bomb, so plant Suction Bombs earlier than usual.",
    "- They inflict more damage from a direct hit (220 HP) and have a larger overall radius of damage (80 DU).",
    "- They can be thrown to lead a push into a Splat Zone or any other important area of the stage, such as the opponents' street or platform.",
    "- They can also flush out opposing anchors from perches and clear other critical areas, such as the Tower.",
    "- They can also be used to poke at and zone out opponents during the neutral phase, stall an opponent's push, or provide space to escape.",
    "- A Suction Bomb can damage or destroy an opponent's Splash Wall, or the Rainmaker shield, while detonating on contact.\nAny opponents caught within the Suction Bomb's explosion will get damaged or splatted.",
    "- Any opponents caught within the Suction Bomb's explosion will get damaged or splatted.",
    "- When activating, it is safer to use while on solid ground. When used, the Inkzooka recoils the player back for each shot, possibly pushing the user into enemy ink or off the stage.",
    "- The range of the Inkzooka is the second longest of the game, being bested only by the E-liter 3K variants. The range can be used to pick off any snipers, campers, or stopping Rainmaker pushes.",
    "- While aiming, the pillar of ink cannot go down below the user's area. It is best to be used at the same or below the level of an opponent.",
    "- Bombs can still be thrown while using the Inkzooka which can be used as an escape from opponents.",
    "- An opponent with a long-ranged weapon can more aggressively position themselves to zone out the entire shorter-ranged team.",
    "- The opposing slayers can play more aggressively, knowing that there is no long-ranged threat to pick them off from afar.",
    "- When pursuing an opposing Tentatek Splattershot, be wary of any Suction Bomb traps the opponent may have planted, such as around a corner or under a grate.",
    "- If an opposing Tentatek Splattershot user throws a Suction Bomb onto the Tower while you are riding it, you can move to the other side of the Tower and use the stake for cover from the blast. However, be ready to fend off any opponents – including the opposing Tentatek Splattershot user – who attempt to attack this other side.",
    "- If an opposing Tentatek Splattershot user activates Inkzooka at an unsafe position, try attacking them.\nThe Inkzooka's pillar of ink is very thin and relies on accuracy in order to be effective.\nOnce a shot is fired, the user will have to wait until the next shot can be fired. During this time, the user cannot fight back unless by throwing a bomb, which leaves them very vulnerable.",

    "- Offensively, its good mobility allows its user to apply pressure onto the opponent – whether head-on or through timely flanking – eliminating key defenders during a push. Swim Speed Up can further help either close the distance towards an opponent or flee from an unfavorable matchup.",

    "- An opponent's Splashdown or Booyah Bomb will defuse any Splat Bombs it comes in contact with, so hold off throwing them until after the special weapon finishes.",
    "- The Splat Bomb will also inflate or pop a teammate's bubbles but deflate or diffuse an opponent's bubbles.",
    "- Any opponents caught within the Splat Bomb's explosion will get damaged or splatted.",
    "- Upon activation, its launching point is marked for all players – teammates and opponents – to see and, as of version 3.2.0, also indicates when its user will return via Super Jump, allowing an opponent to camp or shark there. Therefore, it is advised to launch the Inkjet from a less visible and better-protected area.\nDrop Roller allows its user to better dodge either a potential Inkjet punish or a simple super jump punish, providing a safer landing.\nSpecials are also free ink reloads, allowing the Tentatek Splattershot user to drop a Splat Bomb upon landing after the special ends.",
    "- Its movement speed is determined by both the Tentatek Splattershot's strafing speed and the number of Run Speed Up ability points equipped.",
    "- It is also possible to morph into squid/octopus form and swim (in friendly ink) while the special is active. This provides some key benefits:\nMorphing will halt the jets to enable the pilot to descend, making them a less predictable target.\nSwimming is faster than flying, enabling an Inkjet pilot to activate the special at a farther distance from opponents and more quickly pursue them.",
    "- Its altitude depends on the elevation of the surface it is hovering above, enabling it to either fly very high over an elevated structure, such as the glass roof in Shellendorf Institute, or hover high enough to challenge an opponent on a perch.\nHowever, the Inkjet cannot achieve thrust off of grates or mesh, causing its pilot to merely walk on them. Avoid hovering over them to maintain altitude.\nPressing the  button will provide a temporary extra thrust. Mastery of both boosting and descending (see above) is necessary for Inkjet pilots to become less predictable for long-ranged opponents to track and pick off.",
    "- Its mobility enables it to reach areas that are otherwise not easily accessible — or even inaccessible, such as over the glass enclosures in Kelp Dome.",
    "- The Inkjet's cannon fires long-ranged, Rainmaker-like bursts of ink that splat opponents in one direct hit or two to four indirect hits:\nLead the Inkjet's shots to compensate for their slightly slower travel speed, especially when positioned farther from an intended target.\nIts splash damage can splat opponents positioned behind obstacles, varying from 30 to 50 damage; the closer the shot to the opponent, the more damage it deals.",
    "- If an Inkjet falls out of bounds, such as into the water, its pilot will land back onto the location of launch — or the most previous point of solid ground. Therefore, the Inkjet can save a player from an out-of-bounds splat in a pinch. You can also use this to your advantage. When being pressured by the enemy team, going into water can save you from being splatted.",
    "- Drop Roller allows its user to better dodge either a potential Inkjet punish or a simple super jump punish, providing a safer landing.",
    "- Specials are also free ink reloads, allowing the Tentatek Splattershot user to drop a Splat Bomb upon landing after the special ends.",

    "- Its splash damage can splat opponents positioned behind obstacles, varying from 30 to 50 damage; the closer the shot to the opponent, the more damage it deals.",
    "- Because an Ink Armored player can withstand more damage — especially from an opponent's charger, an armored Inkjet pilot can fly more aggressively.",
    "- Sometimes, it can pay to wait a little longer for a teammate to build up and activate Ink Armor before activating Inkjet. However, do not hesitate to use your special weapon whenever it is needed during a battle, such as when making a push, protecting a lead, or distracting an opposing anchor.",
    "- Matchups between Tentatek Splattershots on opposing teams are determined by each player's skill, positioning, turf control, and the presence of any teammates.",
    "- Any weapon that has a combination of longer range, better accuracy, or higher damage output without sacrificing too much mobility can counter a Tentatek Splattershot. For example, both the Splattershot Pro and L-3 Nozzlenose and their respective variants meet all of these requirements.",
    "- If using a shorter ranged weapon against an opposing Tentatek Splattershot user (88 units), rely on flanking or sharking them instead of a direct attack.",
    "- A long-ranged weapon, such as a charger or most splatlings, can not only attack a Tentatek Splattershot from long distance with impunity but also punish a predictable Inkjet. However, once the Tentatek Splattershot gets close, it can outmaneuver and outdraw its less mobile, slower firing opponent.",
    "- A competent Tentatek Splattershot user is likely capable at both flanking and sharking:\nKeep track of all four members of the opposing team – which ones are present, which ones are splatted, and which ones are back at their spawn point.\nCheck the map periodically for opposing ink forming around flanks to anticipate a flanking attack.\nTo prevent sharking, check suspicious puddles of the opponents' ink, preferably with a thrown sub weapon.\nWeapons that track opponents, such as Point Sensors, temporarily prevent an opponent from sharking and make them an easier target for long-ranged teammates to pick off.",
    "- When pursued by a Tentatek Splattershot, using almost any sub weapon (except for Squid Beakons) can either delay their pursuit or deter them from chasing.",
    "- When pursuing a Tentatek Splattershot, be wary of any Splat Bombs they might plant while retreating, such as around a corner or after climbing a ledge.",
    "- Dogfights between opposing Inkjets are generally decided by each pilot's skill, positioning, and any teammates present.",
    "- To punish an opposing Inkjet after it lands, eliminate its pilot's teammates while avoiding both its shots and exhaust before punishing the landing, preferably with a well-placed, well-timed bomb followed by shots from the main weapon. Make sure the opposing pilot does not have Drop Roll, however.",
    "- Keep track of all four members of the opposing team – which ones are present, which ones are splatted, and which ones are back at their spawn point.",
