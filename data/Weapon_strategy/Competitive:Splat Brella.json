  "content": "The Splat Brella – along with the Hero Brella Replica – is the first weapon of the brella class introduced in Splatoon 2. Compared to weapons from other classes, its mechanics are very different, requiring its user to adopt a unique playstyle. However, once its nuances are fully understood, it can assist its user's team and hinder opponents in ways that more typical weapons cannot.\n\nThe Splat Brella is a zoning support weapon, which – unlike traditional support weapons, such as the Splattershot Jr. and the N-ZAP '85 – controls space and aids its user's team through means other than turfing and special weapon farming.\n\n- The weapon has a shotgun-like blast, firing six pellets of ink per tap of :\nEach ink pellet can inflict up to 16.2 HP of damage. However, only up to five pellets can damage an opponent per shot, capping the maximum damage per shot to 81 HP and preventing the Splat Brella from having a one-shot-splat against most opponents.\nThe Splat Brella has a range of 111.04 DU[4] — shorter than that of most other weapons, meaning that its user cannot challenge their opponents by simply charging head-on.\nIts fire rate is 16 frames between shots — slower than that of automatic shooters and dualies (4-12 frames). This means that a Splat Brella user will have to be even more accurate and precise with their aim than would users of automatically firing weapons, as any missed shot would leave them wide open to attack before the brella shield is up.\nAiming down at the body of your opponent – rather than up at their head – will ensure that more pellets will hit their target and damage output is maximized.[5]\nWhile its shot spread is quick at turfing, a Splat Brella is not quite as quick or efficient at turfing as are more conventional support weapons.\n\n- Each ink pellet can inflict up to 16.2 HP of damage.

Give yourself enough time and distance from the opponent to open up the shield.\nIt can withstand 500 HP of damage before it is destroyed. However, it has different incoming damage multipliers for each weapon type. It takes…\n…only 70% of damage from automatic and semiautomatic firing weapons — such as shooters, dualies, and splatlings,…\n…150% of damage from swung (but not rolled) rollers and brushes,…\n…200% of damage from sloshers and the explosion of all bombs,…\n…and 300% of damage from all chargers.\nObject Shredder does not affect any damage inflicted onto a brella shield.[6]\nSting Ray and Ink Storm ignore the brella shield, dealing direct damage to the brella's user.\nA launched brella shield will be instantly destroyed upon contact with another brella shield, a Splash Wall, or the Rainmaker shield.\nOpponents' bombs will instantly detonate upon contact with the Splat Brella's shield, splatting any teammates who happen to be in front of it. Therefore, do not raise the brella shield whenever a teammate is in front of you.\nAn open brella shield can provide its user good temporary protection whenever strafing is not an option, such as in a narrow passage or on the Tower.[7]\nWhile holding the Splat Brella open, its user's run speed is 0.55 DU/f – even slower than while firing the weapon (0.65 DU/f) – and jumping height is reduced.\nA Splat Brella user can jump then fire and open the shield in midair to reach their normal jumping height. This can be a useful tactic against opposing blaster users who attempt to fire above the brella shield.[8]\nThe shield – whether attached or launched – can damage opponents on contact for 30 HP. This technique (with an attached shield) can be used in combos with the weapon's shots to quickly splat opponents who charge toward you.[8]\nHolding down  for 122 frames, or 2.03 seconds, launches the shield forward. Keep this in mind to avoid accidentally launching the shield.\nLaunching the Splat Brella shield requires 30% of the ink tank, on top of the 6.35% used to fire a shot, for a total of 36.35%.\nA launched Splat Brella shield travels at 1.32 DU/f, takes half the normal damage from opponents' attacks, and remains on the stage for up to five seconds.\nIf the shield is launched or destroyed, it will take 390 frames, or 6.5 seconds, to regenerate. Main Power Up can shorten the regeneration time to as low as 210 frames, or 3.5 seconds.[9] Before launching your brella shield, make sure you can survive without it during the regeneration time.\n\n- The shield takes 12 frames (0.2 seconds) to open, on top of the 8 to 16 frames (0.133 to 0.267 seconds) needed to fire a shot, for a total of 20 to 28 frames (0.333 to 0.467 seconds).

Main Power Up can shorten the regeneration time to as low as 210 frames, or 3.5 seconds.[9] Before launching your brella shield, make sure you can survive without it during the regeneration time.\n\n- The addition of a shield gives a Splat Brella user more options when facing an opponent. Mastering all of them is essential to winning or prolonging various one-on-one matchups:[8]\nThe most basic of these is simply alternating between shooting and shielding. Shielding allows a Splat Brella user to either close in on a longer-ranged opponent – such as an opposing Kensa Splattershot Pro user – or zone out a shorter-ranged one – like an opposing Sploosh-o-matic 7 user. However, just shooting and shielding keeps the Splat Brella user's strafing speed low (0.55-0.65 DU/f) and their patterns predictable.\nSwimming after either shooting or shielding makes a Splat Brella user more mobile — especially when sub strafing. This enables them to reposition themselves for a better angle, more quickly pursue a weakened opponent, or more readily retreat from an unfavorable matchup.\nWhile launching the brella shield carries some risk of getting caught without it, there are a couple of practical applications:\nLaunching the brella shield before retreating around an obstacle leaves a pursuing opponent an obstruction that they must either destroy or travel around.\nA launched brella shield can provide some protection for either its user or one of their teammates running or swimming just behind of it — particularly in a narrow passage, where there is less room for an opponent to flank around.\n\n- The most basic of these is simply alternating between shooting and shielding.

A Sprinkler placed high on a wall or ceiling can also be a distraction for an opponent.\n\n- They can also act as a light shield in a pinch. Sprinklers have 120 hit points but are easily destroyed by opponents armed with Object Shredder.\n\nInk Storm is an area of effect (AoE) special weapon that can alter the battle if activated in the right location and direction:\n\n- Immediately upon activating the special, its user will be holding the Ink Storm device and be vulnerable to attack. Therefore, do not activate the special while being attacked, and make sure to throw it onto a surface before an opponent gets the opportunity to splat you.\n\n- Slower, less mobile opponents – especially Rainmaker carriers – are less capable of escaping Ink Storm's area of effect and, thus, are more adversely affected.\n\n- Its gradual damage makes it a good counter against Ink Armor, especially when paired with Object Shredder.\n\n- Ink Storm's damage on the opponent becomes more effective whenever the opponent has less space to maneuver around, such as in an alley or on the Tower.\n\n- Defensively, Ink Storm can slow or disrupt the opponents' push by either altering their intended attack routes or weakening any opponents within the storm.\n\n- Offensively, Ink Storm can soften opposing defenses by forcing opponents out of optimal positions and inflicting chip damage onto those caught in the ink rain.\n\n- Besides potentially damaging opponents, Ink Storm also gradually turfs any non-vertical surface it travels over:\nThe damaging and turfing effects of Ink Storm are slower and more gradual than those of a Bomb Launcher but are automatic and does not require its user to risk endangering themselves.\n\n- The damaging and turfing effects of Ink Storm are slower and more gradual than those of a Bomb Launcher but are automatic and does not require its user to risk endangering themselves.\n\n- An Ink Storm above the Rainmaker can either weaken its shield to pop it or prevent the opponent from popping it.\n\n- Special weapons are also free ink tank refills, and since the Ink Storm does not require much commitment to use, it can be used to quickly top up your ink tank.\n\n- The Ink Storm can also be combined with the shield to stall opponents as they gradually take damage in it. This can also potentially lead to a one-shot splat. For best results, it is recommended to fight opponents while standing underneath your Ink Storm.[10]\n\n- The damaging and turfing effects of Ink Storm are slower and more gradual than those of a Bomb Launcher but are automatic and does not require its user to risk endangering themselves.\n\nBesides having unique mechanics, the Splat Brella also demands a different mindset and playstyle from other weapons. Its user controls space not by constantly turfing – as a traditional support weapon would – but by restraining the movement of their opponents, particularly slayers armed with shooters or dualies. Survivability is a Splat Brella's greatest asset against these weapons, so instead of attempting to quickly win one-on-one matchups against them, a Splat Brella user should aim to prolong battles and distract the opponents away from the objective, which your teammates can then push.[2][11]\n\n- Use the Splat Brella's shield and your movement – whether swimming, sub strafing, or shield strafing – to repel and avoid attacks to prolong a one-on-one battle until another opponent engages you, at which point you should strongly consider retreating (via Super Jumping if necessary).\n\n- If a teammate is engaged in a one-on-one with an opponent, offer to help by joining the fray and providing protection for your teammate. Just remember to not open the brella shield until you are either in front of your teammate or engaging the opponent from a different angle.\n\nWhile a team might get away with having one or two users of short-ranged weapons, such as the Splat Brella, having a team composition with too many short-ranged weapons and no longer-ranged weapons to provide support fire is often disadvantageous for a number of reasons:[12]\n\n- An opponent with a long-ranged weapon can more aggressively position themselves to zone out the entire shorter-ranged team.\n\n- The opposing slayers can play more aggressively, knowing that there is no long-ranged threat to pick them off from afar.\n\nThe Splat Brella's lack of lethal bombs – particularly either Splat or Suction Bombs – generally necessitates its user's teammates to equip weapons that include them. Lethal bombs provide their user's team a couple advantages over another team that has no lethal bombs in its composition:[12]\n\n- Their one-hit-splat offers its user's team chances of instantly gaining a numbers advantage, from which a game-winning push can arise.\n\n- Their lethal explosion provides space for its user's team to either push into an area held by the opponent or stall an opponent's push.\n\nInk Storm is intended for either contesting territory, such as Splat Zones, or stalling opponents' pushes but is not as reliable at splatting opponents who actively avoid the Storm. Therefore, it is advised to have other special weapons available to complement Ink Storm, as having too many users of any combination of Ink Storm and Bomb Launcher (no more than two) in a team composition will limit a team's arsenal of weapons:[12]\n\n- Ink Storm provides no direct means of protection, meaning that opponents can still fire or throw sub weapons into the Storm.\n\n- Other special weapons, such as Inkjet or Sting Ray, are intended for splatting opponents and more capable at this than is Ink Storm.\n\n- While double teaming any opponent is usually advantageous, it is often mandatory against an opposing Splat Brella user due to their survivability against single opponents. However, do not get too distracted from the objective.\n\n- Conversely, do not get caught alone against an opposing Splat Brella user, particularly if you are wielding a short- to medium-ranged shooter or dualie with no bombs, as the latter can punish players who overextend.\nSlow firing shooters, such as the .96 Gal and the H-3 Nozzlenose D tend to fare poorly against an opposing Splat Brella user since the long lag between shots or bursts provides more opportunities for the Brella user to lower their shield and fire.[13]\n\n- Slow firing shooters, such as the .96 Gal and the H-3 Nozzlenose D tend to fare poorly against an opposing Splat Brella user since the long lag between shots or bursts provides more opportunities for the Brella user to lower their shield and fire.[13]\n\n- Blaster users can fire either around or above an opposing Splat Brella user's shield and inflict splash damage onto their opponent. Just keep the opposing Splat Brella user at the maximum range of your main weapon to maximize the amount of damage dealt to them.\n\n- Some dualies have extra mobility to make their users less predictable with their movement and harder to shield their shots. The Dualie Squelchers allow their user to slide after dodge rolling, while the Dark Tetra Dualies permit their user to perform four dodge rolls.\n\n- Every variant of the Tenta Brella is a strong counter against an opposing Splat Brella user due to both their one-shot-splat potential and ability to destroy the latter's shield should both shields collide.[5]\n\n- Long-ranged weapon users who keep an opposing Splat Brella user at bay can fire upon their shield to damage or destroy it with little worry of retaliation:\nA Splat Charger user with nine ability points, or three subs, of Main Power Up can destroy an opposing Splat Brella user's shield in one fully charged hit.[5]\nA Custom Hydra Splatling at full charge can destroy an opponent's Splat Brella shield in 21 hits, or 80 frames (1.33 seconds).\n\n- A Splat Charger user with nine ability points, or three subs, of Main Power Up can destroy an opposing Splat Brella user's shield in one fully charged hit.[5]\n\n- A Custom Hydra Splatling at full charge can destroy an opponent's Splat Brella shield in 21 hits, or 80 frames (1.33 seconds).\n\n- Proper usage of sub weapons can limit an opposing Splat Brella user's options:[10]\nSplat and Suction Bombs can apply a decent amount of damage to a Splat Brella shield when thrown directly at it. If thrown off to the side or behind the user, the bombs can still limit the Splat Brella's movement.\nA fully-charged Fizzy Bomb will instantly break a Splat Brella's shield. If the opponent opts to not shield the damage, they will likely take some splash damage from the Fizzy Bomb.\nAny bomb with a tracking function – either Autobombs or Torpedoes – can force an opposing Splat Brella user to lower their shield and either move to dodge the bomb or, in the case of Torpedoes, shoot it down.\nToxic Mist is particularly effective against Splat Brellas due to its ink tank-draining capabilities. If thrown at the Splat Brella user, they can either choose to slowly strafe away with shield up as the Toxic Mist depletes their ink tank, or swim away, from which they can be picked off due to having to drop their shield.\nA Splash Wall can destroy a Splat Brella shield launched by an opponent upon contact.\n\n- Splat and Suction Bombs can apply a decent amount of damage to a Splat Brella shield when thrown directly at it.

Long-ranged weapons, thrown sub weapons, and other special weapons (such as a counter-Ink Storm or Bomb Launcher) can splat opponents or dissuade them from occupying the turf underneath.\n\n- In general, avoid getting caught under an opponent's Ink Storm for an extended time, but also be wary of opponents waiting to pick off anyone fleeing the Storm.\n\n- If you must travel under an opponent's Ink Storm, avoid moving in the same direction that the Storm is traveling to minimize damage.\n\n- Even while avoiding an opponent's Ink Storm, it is still possible to turf or otherwise influence the area underneath. Long-ranged weapons, thrown sub weapons, and other special weapons (such as a counter-Ink Storm or Bomb Launcher) can splat opponents or dissuade them from occupying the turf underneath.\n\n- Slow firing shooters, such as the .96 Gal and the H-3 Nozzlenose D tend to fare poorly against an opposing Splat Brella user since the long lag between shots or bursts provides more opportunities for the Brella user to lower their shield and fire.[13]\n\n- A Splat Charger user with nine ability points, or three subs, of Main Power Up can destroy an opposing Splat Brella user's shield in one fully charged hit.[5]\n\n- A Custom Hydra Splatling at full charge can destroy an opponent's Splat Brella shield in 21 hits, or 80 frames (1.33 seconds).\n\n- Splat and Suction Bombs can apply a decent amount of damage to a Splat Brella shield when thrown directly at it. If thrown off to the side or behind the user, the bombs can still limit the Splat Brella's movement.\n\n- A fully-charged Fizzy Bomb will instantly break a Splat Brella's shield. If the opponent opts to not shield the damage, they will likely take some splash damage from the Fizzy Bomb.\n\n- Any bomb with a tracking function – either Autobombs or Torpedoes – can force an opposing Splat Brella user to lower their shield and either move to dodge the bomb or, in the case of Torpedoes, shoot it down.\n\n- Toxic Mist is particularly effective against Splat Brellas due to its ink tank-draining capabilities.

This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.\n\nBecause bombs are a good countermeasure against an opposing brella user, a Splat Brella user can expect to have the opponents' bombs thrown their way. Ever since its introduction in version 4.3.0, Bomb Defense Up DX will not only reduce the damage taken from opposing sub and special weapons that are not one-hit-splat but will also reduce the duration of the tracking effects of certain opponent's sub and special weapons, such as Point Sensors and Ink Mines, allowing the user of this ability to evade detection more easily. Just three ability points, or one sub, offer plenty of utility:[14][15]\n\n- The splash damage of most bombs is reduced from 30 HP to 28.6 HP. This reduction in damage provides two benefits:\nIt prevents its user from being exposed on their opponents' map by the splash damage of most single bombs.\nInk Armor will not break due to splash damage from a single bomb whose splash damage normally inflicts 30 HP of damage.\n\n- It prevents its user from being exposed on their opponents' map by the splash damage of most single bombs.\n\n- Ink Armor will not break due to splash damage from a single bomb whose splash damage normally inflicts 30 HP of damage.\n\n- The splash damage of near-misses from either Tenta Missiles or Inkjet, the minimum splash damage of bubbles, and the collision damage from Baller are all reduced from 50 HP to 48.3 HP,[16] enabling one to survive two hits from any of these specific means of special weapon damage.\n\n- It prevents its user from being exposed on their opponents' map by the splash damage of most single bombs.\n\n- Ink Armor will not break due to splash damage from a single bomb whose splash damage normally inflicts 30 HP of damage.\n\nWhen equipped, Comeback grants 10 ability points of six different stackable abilities for twenty seconds after respawning from getting splatted by an opponent:\n\n- Ink Recovery Up\n\n- Ink Saver (Main)\n\n- Ink Saver (Sub)\n\n- Run Speed Up\n\n- Swim Speed Up\n\n- Special Charge Up\n\nWhile a Splat Brella wielder who plays aggressively would benefit from all of these abilities, they would profit mostly from Ink Recovery Up, Ink Saver (Main), and Run Speed Up, which respectively improve the ink recovery and efficiency of the main weapon and strafing speed while either shooting or shielding.[10][14]\n\nAs a large consumer of ink, the Splat Brella can be fired and launched more often if its user can refill their ink tank at a faster rate. A valuable utility ability for almost any weapon, Ink Recovery Up is even more useful for a Splat Brella user, particularly to quickly recover ink after either launching their shield or using a Sprinkler.[14][15]\n\n- Six ability points, or two subs, decreases the time needed to fully refill an empty ink while submerged in friendly ink from 180 frames, or 3 seconds, to 169 frames, or 2.82 seconds,[9] effectively increasing the refill rate from 33.33%/s (percent per second) to 35.46%/s.\n\nOpponent's ink on various surfaces can not only be damaging to a Splat Brella user but can also reduce mobility, particularly when strafing. Ink Resistance Up not only partially offsets the reduction in mobility but also delays the damage taken from contact with opposing ink.[14][15]\n\n- Just three ability points, or one sub,…\n…delays the damage taken from opposing ink by 10 frames.\n…reduces the damage taken from 0.3 HP/f (health points per frame) to 0.2 HP/f.\n…lowers the limit on the amount of damage opposing ink on surfaces can inflict from 40 HP to 38 HP.\n…increases the normal running speed in opposing ink from 0.24 DU/f to 0.33 DU/f.[9]\n…increases the jumping height in opposing ink from 0.8 to 0.854.[16]\n\n- …delays the damage taken from opposing ink by 10 frames.\n\n- …reduces the damage taken from 0.3 HP/f (health points per frame) to 0.2 HP/f.\n\n- …lowers the limit on the amount of damage opposing ink on surfaces can inflict from 40 HP to 38 HP.\n\n- …increases the normal running speed in opposing ink from 0.24 DU/f to 0.33 DU/f.[9]\n\n- …increases the jumping height in opposing ink from 0.8 to 0.854.[16]\n\n- Six ability points, or two subs,…\n…delays the damage taken from opposing ink by 15 frames.\n…reduces the damage taken to 0.2 HP/f.\n…lowers the damage limit of opposing ink to 36.2 HP.\n…increases the normal running speed in opposing ink to 0.39 DU/f.[9]\n…increases the jumping height in opposing ink to 0.888.[16]\n\n- …delays the damage taken from opposing ink by 15 frames.\n\n- …reduces the damage taken to 0.2 HP/f.\n\n- …lowers the damage limit of opposing ink to 36.2 HP.\n\n- …increases the normal running speed in opposing ink to 0.39 DU/f.[9]\n\n- …increases the jumping height in opposing ink to 0.888.[16]\n\n- …delays the damage taken from opposing ink by 10 frames.\n\n- …reduces the damage taken from 0.3 HP/f (health points per frame) to 0.2 HP/f.\n\n- …lowers the limit on the amount of damage opposing ink on surfaces can inflict from 40 HP to 38 HP.\n\n- …increases the normal running speed in opposing ink from 0.24 DU/f to 0.33 DU/f.[9]\n\n- …increases the jumping height in opposing ink from 0.8 to 0.854.[16]\n\n- …delays the damage taken from opposing ink by 15 frames.\n\n- …reduces the damage taken to 0.2 HP/f.\n\n- …lowers the damage limit of opposing ink to 36.2 HP.\n\n- …increases the normal running speed in opposing ink to 0.39 DU/f.[9]\n\n- …increases the jumping height in opposing ink to 0.888.[16]\n\nThe Splat Brella consumes a sizable amount of ink per shot — about as much as a Slosher or a Kensa Rapid Blaster. Its user also has to consider the large amount of ink required to launch their shield. Ink Saver (Main) helps mitigate this issue by reducing ink consumption per shot and brella launch.[10][14] However, it is not advised to devote more than six ability points, or two subs, to Ink Saver (Main) due to both diminishing returns and fewer available ability points for mobility-enhancing abilities.[5]\n\n[9]\n\nLast-Ditch Effort is a headgear-exclusive ability that, under specific conditions, grants its user 1 to 24 ability points each of the following abilities:\n\n- Ink Saver (Main)\n\n- Ink Saver (Sub)\n\n- Ink Recovery Up\n\nThese abilities only begin to take effect under either of the following conditions:\n\n- There are at most 30 seconds remaining on the game clock, or Overtime has begun in a Ranked Battle, at which the maximum 24 ability points will be granted for each of the above abilities.\n\n- In a Ranked Battle, the opposing team's countdown has at most 50 points remaining. The effects of Last-Ditch Effort increase as the opposing team's countdown decreases from 50 to 30 points remaining, starting with 1 ability point for each ability and maxing out to 24 ability points.\n\nA Splat Brella user can potentially benefit greatly from Last-Ditch Effort, particularly from Ink Saver (Main) and Ink Recovery Up, allowing them to improve their overall ink efficiency while saving more ability points for other abilities.[14]\n\nWhile swimming is still the Splat Brella user's main means of travel, their strafing speed while either firing or opening their shield will be improved with Run Speed Up, enabling them to better evade and repel opponents' attacks.[14]\n\n- 13 ability points, or one main and one sub, are enough to increase…\n…the running speed while firing to above 0.70 DU/f, which matches that of the Kensa Sloshing Machine and the Nautilus 79.\n…the running speed while opening the shield to above 0.60 DU/f, which is the running speed of Kensa .52 Gal and the H-3 Nozzlenose D while firing.\n\n- …the running speed while firing to above 0.70 DU/f, which matches that of the Kensa Sloshing Machine and the Nautilus 79.\n\n- …the running speed while opening the shield to above 0.60 DU/f, which is the running speed of Kensa .52 Gal and the H-3 Nozzlenose D while firing.\n\n- …the running speed while firing to above 0.70 DU/f, which matches that of the Kensa Sloshing Machine and the Nautilus 79.\n\n- …the running speed while opening the shield to above 0.60 DU/f, which is the running speed of Kensa .52 Gal and the H-3 Nozzlenose D while firing.\n\nQuick Super Jump decreases both the \"charge\" time before and the travel time of a Super Jump. Splat Brella users will benefit since Quick Super Jump allows them to both return to the front lines more quickly and escape unfavorable situations more easily to preserve special gauge progress.[14][15]\n\n- One sub, or 3 ability points, of Quick Super Jump decreases the \"charge\" time by 22 frames, or 0.36 seconds.[9]\n\nThe Splat Brella has shorter range than most other weapons, meaning that its user will have to get within range of their longer-ranged opponents in order to be effective in battle. Swim Speed Up enables its user to more quickly close the distance towards an opponent, more quickly respond to an opponents' push, or even escape unfavorable situations.[14]\n\n- Just six ability points, or two subs, increase the swim speed from 1.92 DU/f to 2.01 DU/f, which is roughly the same default swimming speed for lightweight weapons.\n\n- 16 ability points – one main and two subs – further increase the swim speed to 2.14 DU/f.[9]\n\n[17]"
