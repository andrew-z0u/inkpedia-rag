    "Note: this is a draft proposal for a set of community competitive pages about tableturf cards (similar to the strategy pages for weapons). This project is being worked on by a number of members of the competitive tableturf community, none of whom are particularly familiar with the tools this wiki uses. As such we apologise for any rough style or broken page guidelines; just let us know what we can fix to make this more presentable and we'll fix it asap.\nEditors include: Ljovynn DblCookies Zaybeol",

    "- Hero Shot is a great opener on Lakefront Property due to how it guarantees a special point by turn 1, while also having fairly good reach on both sides of the map.",
    "- Its special space is fairly easy to activate, making it versatile and easy to build combos with.",
    "- Because of its thin diagonal extrusion and the narrow 2-wide shape, Hero Shot is great for using 2-wide holes to flank around the opponent's defenses.\nThese flanking opportunities are most often found on Square Squared, Lakefront Property, and Box Seats.",
    "- Hero Shot + Power Clam"
