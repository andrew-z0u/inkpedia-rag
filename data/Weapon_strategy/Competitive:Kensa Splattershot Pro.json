    "- The Kensa Splattershot Pro is a medium ranged slayer weapon, similar to the Splattershot but with a longer range, better accuracy, and higher damage output.\nThe extra range and higher damage output, at just a slight cost to fire rate, make it very effective at splatting a wide variety of opponents.\nMain Power Up further increases this damage output, maxing out to 49.9 points of damage at 42 ability points. Even 29 ability points – about three mains – are enough to exceed 49.5 hit points of damage, so it is not uncommon for players to use three mains of Main Power Up with the Kensa Splattershot Pro.\nAlso like the Splattershot and its variants, the Kensa Splattershot Pro is great at sharking, making it effective on defense as well.",
    "- The reduced ink efficiency and slower fire rate make the Kensa Splattershot Pro a less effective turfing weapon than most other slayer/support weapons. Avoid getting surrounded by opposing ink and have an exit lane in case of a retreat.\nReduced turfing ability hinders its ability to either maintain map control or capture a Splat Zone. In general, focus on splatting opponents and rely on teammates with better turfing weapons to maintain zone or map control.[2]\nWhile the added range and Splat Bombs allow this weapon to potentially play a supportive role, the slower turfing rate combined with the high special gauge requirement for the Kensa Splattershot Pro make it harder to build up its special weapon compared to most conventional support weapons.",
    "- Due to the reduced turfing and ink efficiency, Splat Bombs have to be used more judiciously than usual. However, they can still serve a variety of purposes:\nPushing into a Splat Zone or any other important area of the stage.\nFlushing out opposing anchors from perches, hindering their ability to control space with their range.\nProviding space to escape, whether via both swimming and running or via Super Jumping.",
    "- The Booyah Bomb can either turn the tide of a battle or fully tilt it in the team's favor if used properly.\nIn general, activate the Booyah Bomb in a relatively safe place, as even a Splattershot Jr. within range can break the Booyah Bomb armor.\nThe Booyah Bomb can force opponents – particularly anchors – to move out of position or delay an opponent's offensive push.\nThe explosion of the Booyah Bomb places enough ink to uncap most Splat Zones and single-handedly capture some smaller Splat Zones.\nWhen deployed, the Booyah Bomb is capable of protecting oneself and one's teammates from attacks - including bombs - and clearing an area of opponents, whether forcing them to flee or splatting them outright.",
    "The Kensa Splattershot Pro's long range and high damage allow it to provide support fire and help maintain spatial control, despite its lack of turfing compared to most of the other weapons of a team's composition. Therefore, it is generally redundant to have more than one long-ranged weapon on a team for a few reasons:[3]",
    "- A team with too many long-ranged weapons will have fewer mobile weapons that can more quickly capture turf and wrest control of the objective, hindering its ability to begin an effective push into the opponents' territory. Such a team will also have difficulty breaking out of an opponent's spawn camp.",
    "Because the Kensa Splattershot Pro is inefficient at turfing, its user will have to rely on their teammates to maintain map control. Not having enough turfing ability – usually from having too many blasters and chargers – presents its own set of problems:[3]",
    "- A team whose composition lacks enough turfing ability can be rendered immobile if the other team dominates map control.",
    "- A lack of turfing also makes it difficult to alter the course of a game, even after wiping out the other team.",
    "The Booyah Bomb is a unique special weapon that enables its user's teammates to directly assist in powering it up. However, some considerations need to be taken regarding this trait:",
    "- If you are advanced into the opponents' territory or are either flanking or sharking, refrain from charging a teammate's Booyah Bomb to avoid exposing your position to the opponent.",
    "- It is also generally advised to refrain from charging a teammate's Booyah Bomb while in the middle of a confrontation with an opponent.",
    "- The Kensa Splattershot Pro is a formidable foe for most other weapons, due to its range and damage output. Therefore, most other weapons cannot easily defeat it in a straight one-on-one matchup and must use other means to defeat it.\nA matchup between two opposing Kensa Splattershot Pro wielders will depend on skill, positioning, turf control, and the presence of any supporting players.\nTo engage a Kensa Splattershot Pro with a shorter range weapon, try to catch it off guard through either careful flanking or sharking, better positioning, or wise use of bombs. Do not forget that the Kensa Splattershot Pro also has Splat Bombs as well.\nBoth variants of the Splat Brella can decently counter the Kensa Splattershot Pro due to the durability of their shields. Variants of the Tenta Brella are more damaging and provide more protection, provided that their shields are opened early enough. Variants of the Undercover Brella, however, are too weak to match the Kensa Splattershot Pro's damage, and their shields are not sturdy enough to provide sufficient protection.\nTry to take advantage of the Kensa Splattershot Pro's relative inability to turf by containing it with ink. This might require the use of sub weapons and teammates.\nA few weapons that either match or exceed the range of the Kensa Splattershot Pro without sacrificing mobility can defeat one head-on. For example, both variants of the .96 Gal overpower and slightly outrange the Kensa Splattershot Pro, while both variants of the Squeezer's burst fire mode outrange it. Both variants of the Dualie Squelchers match the Kensa Splattershot Pro's range and can outmaneuver it with dodge rolling and with roll jumping.",
    "- As with versus the Splattershot, long-ranged weapons, such as chargers and most splatlings, can fire upon a Kensa Splattershot Pro with impunity, but they must remain wary of it getting too close.",
    "- To prevent sharking, keep track of all four opponents – particularly which ones have neither been splatted nor super jumped to their spawn point – and turf suspicious puddles of opposing ink, preferably with a sub weapon. Point Sensors, while unable to turf, can expose any sharking opponents.",
    "- If the Kensa Splattershot Pro user activates a Booyah Bomb in an unsafe position, try attacking them, particularly with bombs and chargers.\nTenta Missiles can splat a Booyah Bomb user in three direct hits.\nA Splashdown within range can severely damage Booyah Bomb armor if not destroy it outright.",
    "Gear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.",
    "Increases main weapon damage up to 49.9 if 3 mains and 4 subs are used, or if 2 mains and 7 subs are used.",
    "Decreases ink consumption.",
    "Decreases the required Special points for more Booyah Bomb uses.",
