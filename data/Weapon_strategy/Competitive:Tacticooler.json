    "The Tacticooler is a supportive special weapon in Splatoon 3.",
    "If deployed properly, the Tacticooler can enhance a team's lockout or push, help it break through the opponents' lockout, or counter the opponents' push:[2][4]",
    "- Because both the cooler itself (up to 15 seconds) and the drinks' effects (at least 17 seconds since Version 4.0.0) last a limited amount of time, it is recommended to deploy your Tacticooler just before engaging the opposing team if at least two team members (including yourself) can collect a drink.",
    "- Place the Tacticooler in a safe, easily accessible location:[5]\nIf placed too far into opposing turf or in an area open to attack, anyone who attempts to collect a drink risks getting splatted and not fully benefitting from its effects.\nHowever, placing it too far back will require players who want a drink to give up map control and, to locate it, turn their backs to the opposing team, which is very dangerous.\nIn general, the most optimal Tacticooler location is either around the area your team is staging a lockout or along the objective's path through which your team is pushing.\nSince Version 3.1.0, the longer maximum distance from which a player can collect a drink (including through stage obstacles) makes Tacticooler placement more flexible.[1]",
    "- The cooler will remain on the stage for up to 15 seconds–7.5 seconds if placed on the Tower–and can only be destroyed if it is thrown out-of-bounds or a stage object (such as the Tower) collides into it. Opposing attacks cannot damage it.\nDestroying the cooler in this manner will clear the 10 second cooldown time for your special gauge. Thus, it could be beneficial to place the Tacticooler on the Tower path, quickly collect your drinks, and (after the Tower destroys the cooler) quickly farm another Tacticooler to extend a Tower push.\nThe cooler can be used as a temporary shield against opposing fire. However, its presence might invite opponents to fire sub or special weapons at its location.",
    "- A player under the effects of Tacticooler who is out in the open (i.e., not hidden behind stage obstacles) will be visible to their opponents, even when submerged. Keep this in mind if you have teammates who are sharking so as not to accidently expose their location to your opponents.",
    "- Skirmishers and slayers who collect Tacticooler are free to play more aggressively:[6]\n29 AP of both Run Speed Up and Swim Speed Up and 57 AP of Ink Resistance Up increase their mobility, enabling them to pursue their targets more quickly.\n57 AP of Intensify Action greatly reduces–sometimes negates–the shot spread of many shooters, blasters, and Dualies while jumping.\nAgainst opponents without Tacticooler buffs, 57 AP of Quick Respawn and Special Saver make trading beneficial and feeding less punishing.",
    "- Anchors and supports also have much to gain from the enhanced abilities:\nBoth Run Speed Up and Swim Speed Up allow them to more quickly strafe around opposing fire and pursue targets.\n57 AP of Quick Super Jump ability helps them nearly instantly escape from bad situations or advance forward much faster.\nSpecial Saver gives supports the freedom to be more aggressive with no penalty to their special gauge progress.",
    "The Tacticooler can be a good special for continuing pushes in the event of wiping the opposing team, but is a poor special for retaking control or defending during Tower Control, Rainmaker, or Clam Blitz, as it does not provide paint or damage. Having more than one Tacticooler on a team composition can be a detriment due to these reasons.",
    "Keep an eye on the HUD to know when an opposing Snipewriter 5H user has their Tacticooler ready, and both watch for when it is deployed and listen to its jingle.",
    "- If you can splat–or at least trade with–the opposing Tacticooler provider just before they have it ready, then you could relieve your team of the pressure it would otherwise face from a fully enhanced opposing team.\nThe Trizooka is one of the few weapons that could pick off an opposing Tacticooler provider from a safe distance. Even an indirect hit's splash damage weakens them enough to get splatted by another shot or a teammate's follow up attack.",
    "- Certain sub and special weapons can temporarily deny your opponents access to their Tacticooler (or splat them as they attempt to collect a drink) if it is ever misplaced.",
    "- Sharking around their cooler can also provide an opportunity to pick off opponents and remove their enhancements.",
    "- Players under the effects of Tacticooler are visible–even while submerged in their ink. Unless they can use the physical environment to hide, they are less likely to shark.",
    "- If your team does not have a Tacticooler ready (or has no Tacticoolers in its composition) when your opponents are under the effects of Tacticooler, then your team will need to win the first overall team fight outright against your then win or trade the second overall team fight to prevent them from sustaining a long lockout or push.",
    "- Even when under the effects of a Tacticooler, opposing short-ranged weapon users still begin at a disadvantage against your team's medium-ranged weapon users. Thus, use any range advantage or bombs you have to space out your opponents.[3]",
    "- If positioned carefully, a Crab Tank can stall an opposing Tacticooler push, which can buy time for your team to respawn or prepare a counter-push of your own.[3]"
