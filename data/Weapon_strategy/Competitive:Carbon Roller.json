  "content": "The Carbon Roller in Splatoon works very well as a slayer than in Splatoon 2 with its kit, considered one of the best kits in the game[1]. The Burst Bombs pair well just as the Carbon Roller Deco does in Splatoon 2, but also pairs well with the Inkzooka, giving the user more aggressive options.\n\nCompared to Splatoon 2, the Carbon Roller has a couple differences:\n\n- The Carbon Roller's maximum damage it can deal is 125, compared to 100 in Splatoon 2\n\n- The Carbon Roller consumes 3.5% of the ink tank instead of 4% in Splatoon 2.\n\n- The user has only horizontal flicks that they can use. The horizontal flicks have more range than in Splatoon 2.\n\nThe instant explosion and good ink efficiency of Burst Bombs offer a Carbon Roller user plenty of uses:\n\n- Their quick damage makes them suitable for leading off attacks, or finishing off injured opponents who attempt to flee. Burst Bombs used in combination with both the horizontal and vertical swings allow for faster, more reliable splatting of opponents, including possibly the quickest means to splat Armored opponents.\n\n- They effectively extend the range at which their user can quickly damage their opponents, allowing a Carbon Roller user to more effectively challenge some longer-ranged opponents who get too close.\n\n- They instantly turf inkable surfaces, permitting either a fast pursuit of an opponent or a rapid retreat from an unfavorable situation.\n\n- Opponents hit by Burst Bombs will be surrounded by your team's ink, further limiting their health and mobility.\n\n- Direct hits will inflict 60 HP of damage, while splash damage will only deliver 25-35 HP. Always go for direct hits whenever possible.\n\nThe Inkzooka is a special designed to splat opponents from a distance.\n\n- When activating, it is safer to use while on solid ground. When used, the Inkzooka recoils the player back for each shot, possibly pushing the user into enemy ink or off the stage.\n\n- The range of the Inkzooka is the second longest of the game, being bested only by the E-liter 3K variants. The range can be used to pick off any snipers, campers, or stopping Rainmaker pushes.\n\n- While aiming, the pillar of ink cannot go down below the user's area. It is best to be used at the same or below the level of an opponent.\n\n- Bombs can still be thrown while using the Inkzooka which can be used as an escape from opponents. This pairs well with the Carbon Roller, which has Burst Bombs.\nThe Burst Bombs can be used to ink a path quickly to escape dangerous situations.\nBurst Bombs can also help with attacking opponents who are close by.\n\n- The Burst Bombs can be used to ink a path quickly to escape dangerous situations.\n\n- Burst Bombs can also help with attacking opponents who are close by.\n\n- The Burst Bombs can be used to ink a path quickly to escape dangerous situations.\n\n- Burst Bombs can also help with attacking opponents who are close by.\n\nWhile Burst Bombs have excellent synergy with the Carbon Roller, they lack certain advantages offered by lethal bombs — particularly either Splat or Suction Bombs, which provide their user's team a couple advantages over another team that has no lethal bombs in its composition:\n\n- Their one-hit-splat offers its user's team chances of instantly gaining a numbers advantage, from which a game-winning push can arise.\n\n- Their lethal explosion provides space for its user's team to either push into an area held by the opponent or stall an opponent's push.\n\nInkzooka while useful for splatting, may not be as effective if having more than two players on a team with it for a few reasons:\n\n- The Inkzooka does not turf very well, which makes the weapon struggle with taking back turf.\n\n- Unlike specials such as Killer Wail or Inkstrike, Inkzooka does not force an opposing team to retreat, as they can dodge Inkzooka shots.\n\n- Defense Up can be used to lessen the damage of both the Carbon Roller and the Burst Bombs, allowing a user to potentially survive the Carbon Roller user's combo.\n\n- If an opposing Carbon Roller user activates Inkzooka at an unsafe position, try attacking them.\nThe Inkzooka's pillar of ink is very thin and relies on accuracy in order to be effective.\nOnce a shot is fired, the user will have to wait until the next shot can be fired. During this time, the user cannot fight back unless by throwing a bomb, which leaves them very vulnerable.\n\n- The Inkzooka's pillar of ink is very thin and relies on accuracy in order to be effective.\n\n- Once a shot is fired, the user will have to wait until the next shot can be fired. During this time, the user cannot fight back unless by throwing a bomb, which leaves them very vulnerable.\n\n- Inking the turf around an Inkzooka opponent will severely hamper their mobility, weakening the user from enemy ink. The opponent also cannot turf efficiently the ground around them unless with Burst Bombs.\n\n- Bubbler or Kraken can be used to survive the Inkzooka. The Inkzooka shoots very slowly so they are not able to knock back the user.\n\n- The Inkzooka's pillar of ink is very thin and relies on accuracy in order to be effective.\n\n- Once a shot is fired, the user will have to wait until the next shot can be fired. During this time, the user cannot fight back unless by throwing a bomb, which leaves them very vulnerable.\n\nGear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.\n\nDamage Up increases damage for the main, sub, and special. A Carbon Roller user will benefit most from increased damage from Burst Bombs to increase the chance for bomb combos and to negate Defense Up.\n\nQuick Respawn will always shorten respawn time after getting splatted in this game, encouraging a Carbon Roller user to remain aggressive even after getting splatted and is in general useful for brute forcing your way back into the stage.\n\n- One main, or 10 ability points, reduces the respawn time from 8.5 seconds to 7.29 seconds.\n\n- Two mains, or 20 ability points, drops this further to 6.29 seconds.\n\nSuper Jumping to a teammate after respawning carries the risk of getting splatted upon landing, due to the appearance of a Super Jump indicator. When equipped, Stealth Jump hides this marker completely at the cost of a slower Super Jump both in startup and the jump itself. This pairs well with Quick Respawn.\n\nThe Swim Speed Up ability allows players to swim faster, which makes harder target to kill and much more mobility when moving in squid form. A Carbon Roller user benefits to get into battles quicker, and to escape opponents. \n[2]\n\nUnlike its Deco variant, the vanilla Carbon Roller is not as strong. While it maintains the same traits and playstyle, the kit does not synergize well with what the main weapon wants to do. Lacking Burst Bombs is a major drawback to the weapon, and its cheap Ink Storm, while nice to have, does not aid the weapon's splatting capabilities.[4]\n\nThe Carbon Roller is a stealth slayer's weapon:\n\n- As a lightweight weapon, the Carbon Roller enables its user to run and swim more quickly than usual, allowing for easier dodging and quicker flanking.\n\n- Like the other returning and new rollers in Splatoon 2, the Carbon Roller now has both a horizontal swing and a vertical swing:\nThe horizontal swing has a fire rate of 40 frames and, with no aid from Main Power Up,…\n…a lethal range of 50 DU,…\n…a two-hit range of about 70 DU — shorter than even that of the Sploosh-o-matic (75.64 DU),…[5]\n…and a maximum range of about 90 DU, at which a minimum damage is 25 HP is inflicted.\nInk flung from angle greater than 25 degrees to either the left or right will lose damage starting from 35 DU and reach its minimum value at 75 DU. Therefore, aiming is still important when wielding the Carbon Roller.\nDamage will suffer falloff to as little as 12.5 HP if the flung ink falls below the Carbon Roller wielder. Thus, targets who are below a Carbon Roller user will take less damage than those either above or on the same level.\nOverall, the Carbon Roller's horizontal swing is most effective at close range (≤ 75 DU).\nThe vertical swing has a fire rate of 45 frames and, with no Main Power Up equipped,…\n…a lethal range of about 70 DU,…\n…a two-hit range of about 120 DU — just shy of that of the .52 Gal (124.944 DU),…[5]\n…and a maximum range of about 140 DU.\nFrom 50 DU up until 150 DU, its damage decreases from its base damage of 120 HP to 35 HP.\nLike that of the horizontal swing, its damage will suffer falloff to as little as 17.5 HP if the flung ink falls below the Carbon Roller user. Because a roller wielder needs to be in mid-air after jumping to execute a vertical swing, falloff tends to affect the vertical swing more often than it affects the horizontal swing.\nOverall, the vertical swing is both quick and long reaching, allowing it to poke at opponents and even splat airborne opponents.[6]\n\n- The horizontal swing has a fire rate of 40 frames and, with no aid from Main Power Up,…\n…a lethal range of 50 DU,…\n…a two-hit range of about 70 DU — shorter than even that of the Sploosh-o-matic (75.64 DU),…[5]\n…and a maximum range of about 90 DU, at which a minimum damage is 25 HP is inflicted.\nInk flung from angle greater than 25 degrees to either the left or right will lose damage starting from 35 DU and reach its minimum value at 75 DU. Therefore, aiming is still important when wielding the Carbon Roller.\nDamage will suffer falloff to as little as 12.5 HP if the flung ink falls below the Carbon Roller wielder.

Thus, targets who are below a Carbon Roller user will take less damage than those either above or on the same level.\n\n- Overall, the Carbon Roller's horizontal swing is most effective at close range (≤ 75 DU).\n\n- The vertical swing has a fire rate of 45 frames and, with no Main Power Up equipped,…\n…a lethal range of about 70 DU,…\n…a two-hit range of about 120 DU — just shy of that of the .52 Gal (124.944 DU),…[5]\n…and a maximum range of about 140 DU.\nFrom 50 DU up until 150 DU, its damage decreases from its base damage of 120 HP to 35 HP.\nLike that of the horizontal swing, its damage will suffer falloff to as little as 17.5 HP if the flung ink falls below the Carbon Roller user. Because a roller wielder needs to be in mid-air after jumping to execute a vertical swing, falloff tends to affect the vertical swing more often than it affects the horizontal swing.\nOverall, the vertical swing is both quick and long reaching, allowing it to poke at opponents and even splat airborne opponents.[6]\n\n- …a lethal range of about 70 DU,…\n\n- …a two-hit range of about 120 DU — just shy of that of the .52 Gal (124.944 DU),…[5]\n\n- …and a maximum range of about 140 DU.\n\n- From 50 DU up until 150 DU, its damage decreases from its base damage of 120 HP to 35 HP.\n\n- Like that of the horizontal swing, its damage will suffer falloff to as little as 17.5 HP if the flung ink falls below the Carbon Roller user. Because a roller wielder needs to be in mid-air after jumping to execute a vertical swing, falloff tends to affect the vertical swing more often than it affects the horizontal swing.\n\n- Overall, the vertical swing is both quick and long reaching, allowing it to poke at opponents and even splat airborne opponents.[6]\n\n- Because of its overall short range and specific style of attacks, the most ideal position of a Carbon Roller wielder is often just below the opponents' perch, where the Carbon Roller user can shark around, splat opponents who either drop down or get too close to the ledge, and poke at opponents atop the perch.\n\n- The horizontal swing has a fire rate of 40 frames and, with no aid from Main Power Up,…\n…a lethal range of 50 DU,…\n…a two-hit range of about 70 DU — shorter than even that of the Sploosh-o-matic (75.64 DU),…[5]\n…and a maximum range of about 90 DU, at which a minimum damage is 25 HP is inflicted.\nInk flung from angle greater than 25 degrees to either the left or right will lose damage starting from 35 DU and reach its minimum value at 75 DU.

Because a roller wielder needs to be in mid-air after jumping to execute a vertical swing, falloff tends to affect the vertical swing more often than it affects the horizontal swing.\n\n- Overall, the vertical swing is both quick and long reaching, allowing it to poke at opponents and even splat airborne opponents.[6]\n\nWhile not always as reliable as Splat Bombs, Autobombs still provide plenty of utility for the Carbon Roller user:\n\n- When attacking an opponent's position, try to throw Autobombs in a direction that distracts the opponent's attention.\n\n- Autobombs can be used to poke at opponents during the neutral phase.\n\n- Their tracking ability is a useful feature when checking for sharking opponents, forcing them out of hiding.\n\n- They can provide space to escape when dropped behind, whether via both swimming and running or via super jumping.\n\n- Make sure to refill on ink after throwing an Autobomb before committing to a fight.\n\nInk Storm is an area of effect (AoE) special weapon that can alter the battle if activated in the right location and direction:\n\n- Immediately upon activating the special, its user will be holding the Ink Storm device and be vulnerable to attack. Therefore, do not activate the special while being attacked, and make sure to throw it onto a surface before an opponent gets the opportunity to splat you.\n\n- Slower, less mobile opponents – especially Rainmaker carriers – are less capable of escaping Ink Storm's area of effect and, thus, are more adversely affected.\n\n- Its gradual damage makes it a good counter against Ink Armor, especially when paired with Object Shredder.\n\n- Ink Storm's damage on the opponent becomes more effective whenever the opponent has less space to maneuver around, such as in an alley or on the Tower.\n\n- Defensively, Ink Storm can slow or disrupt the opponents' push by either altering their intended attack routes or weakening any opponents within the storm.\n\n- Offensively, Ink Storm can soften opposing defenses by forcing opponents out of optimal positions and inflicting chip damage onto those caught in the ink rain.\n\n- Besides potentially damaging opponents, Ink Storm also gradually turfs any non-vertical surface it travels over:\nThe damaging and turfing effects of Ink Storm are slower and more gradual than those of a Bomb Launcher but are automatic and does not require its user to risk endangering themselves.\n\n- The damaging and turfing effects of Ink Storm are slower and more gradual than those of a Bomb Launcher but are automatic and does not require its user to risk endangering themselves.\n\n- An Ink Storm above the Rainmaker can either weaken its shield to pop it or prevent the opponent from popping it.\n\n- Special weapons are also free ink tank refills, allowing a Carbon Roller user to launch Ink Storm and immediately attack opponents fleeing it.\n\n- The damaging and turfing effects of Ink Storm are slower and more gradual than those of a Bomb Launcher but are automatic and does not require its user to risk endangering themselves.\n\nThe Carbon Roller is very effective at performing its intended role: stealthily and swiftly splatting opponents at close range while creating a sense of paranoia within the opposing team, which can sometimes distract them from the main objective of the battle. However, it has a set of glaring weaknesses that have to be addressed by the rest of its user's team's composition.\n\nThe first of these is the Carbon Roller's lack of range. While one short-ranged weapon will not be too much of a detriment on a team, having too many short-ranged weapons without a longer-ranged weapon to provide support fire is often disadvantageous for a number of reasons:[7]\n\n- An opponent with a long-ranged weapon can more aggressively position themselves to zone out the entire shorter-ranged team.\n\n- The opposing slayers can play more aggressively, knowing that there is no long-ranged threat to pick them off from afar.\n\nWhile a Carbon Roller is capable of turfing thoroughly through rolling, it is a slow and inefficient means, so its user will have to rely on their teammates to maintain map control for them to move about the map to remain an effective player. Not having enough turfing ability presents its own set of problems:[7]\n\n- A team whose composition lacks enough turfing ability can be rendered immobile if the other team dominates map control.\n\n- A lack of turfing also makes it difficult to alter the course of a game, even after wiping out the other team.\n\nWhile Autobombs technically count as a lethal bomb, they are not as reliable as conventional bombs. Due to this, be sure to still include weapons whose kits have other lethal bombs — particularly either Splat or Suction Bombs, which provide its user's team many advantages over another team that has no lethal bombs in its composition:[8]\n\n- Their one-hit-splat offers its user's team chances of instantly gaining a numbers advantage, from which a game-winning push can arise.\n\n- Their lethal explosion provides space for its user's team to either push into an area held by the opponent or stall an opponent's push.\n\n- The turf inked by the resulting explosion contributes to both maintaining map control and building up the special gauge.\n\nInk Storm is intended for either contesting territory, such as Splat Zones, or stalling opponents' pushes but is not as reliable at splatting opponents who actively avoid the Storm. Therefore, it is advised to have other special weapons available to complement Ink Storm, as having too many users of any combination of Ink Storm and Bomb Launcher (no more than two) in a team composition will limit a team's arsenal of weapons:[7]\n\n- Ink Storm provides no direct means of protection, meaning that opponents can still fire or throw sub weapons into the Storm.\n\n- Other special weapons, such as Inkjet or Sting Ray, are intended for splatting opponents and more capable at this than is Ink Storm.\n\nCombining Ink Storm with other specials can bolster a team's ability to either make a push or counter the opponents' push:\n\n- Ink Armor and other protective special weapons, such as Baller and Bubble Blower, can increase the survivability of a team as they push into contested territory.\n\n- After launching Ink Storm, a teammate who is using a special weapon designed for splat opponents, such as Sting Ray or Inkjet, can further limit the opponents' escape options or splat them as they scatter.\n\n- Any weapon with an effective range longer than the lethal range of the Carbon Roller can counter an opposing Carbon Roller user who attempts to challenge opponents head-on. However, most Carbon Roller users worth their salt will rely more on flanking and sharking, so anyone facing a team with an opposing Carbon Roller wielder must take a few proactive measures to avoid getting flanked or sharked:\nKeep track of all four members of the opposing team – which ones are present, which ones are splatted, and which ones are back at their spawn point.\nCheck the map periodically for opposing ink forming around flanks to anticipate a flanking attack.\nTo prevent sharking, check suspicious puddles of the opponents' ink, preferably with a thrown sub weapon.\nWeapons that track opponents, such as Point Sensors, temporarily prevent an opponent from sharking and makes them an easier target for long-ranged teammates to pick off.\n\n- Keep track of all four members of the opposing team – which ones are present, which ones are splatted, and which ones are back at their spawn point.\n\n- Check the map periodically for opposing ink forming around flanks to anticipate a flanking attack.\n\n- To prevent sharking, check suspicious puddles of the opponents' ink, preferably with a thrown sub weapon.\n\n- Weapons that track opponents, such as Point Sensors, temporarily prevent an opponent from sharking and makes them an easier target for long-ranged teammates to pick off.\n\n- When facing an opposing Ink Storm, assess where is a safe place to either reroute an attack or reposition on defense:\nIn general, avoid getting caught under an opponent's Ink Storm for an extended time, but also be wary of opponents waiting to pick off anyone fleeing the Storm.\nPay extra attention to where the opposing Custom Dualie Squelchers user – and any other opponents whose main weapons' damage is increased with Main Power Up – is at whenever they launch their Ink Storm.\nIf you must travel under an opponent's Ink Storm, avoid moving in the same direction that the Storm is traveling to minimize damage.\nEven while avoiding an opponent's Ink Storm, it is still possible to turf or otherwise influence the area underneath. Long-ranged weapons, thrown sub weapons, and other special weapons (such as a counter-Ink Storm or Bomb Launcher) can splat opponents or dissuade them from occupying the turf underneath.\n\n- In general, avoid getting caught under an opponent's Ink Storm for an extended time, but also be wary of opponents waiting to pick off anyone fleeing the Storm.\n\n- Pay extra attention to where the opposing Custom Dualie Squelchers user – and any other opponents whose main weapons' damage is increased with Main Power Up – is at whenever they launch their Ink Storm.\n\n- If you must travel under an opponent's Ink Storm, avoid moving in the same direction that the Storm is traveling to minimize damage.\n\n- Even while avoiding an opponent's Ink Storm, it is still possible to turf or otherwise influence the area underneath.

This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.\n\nAs a short-ranged stealth slayer's weapon, the Carbon Roller encourages its user to shark nearby their opponents, who might be inclined to use bombs flush them out. Ever since its introduction in version 4.3.0, Bomb Defense Up DX will not only reduce the damage taken from opposing sub and special weapons that are not one-hit-splat but will also reduce the duration of the tracking effects of certain opponent's sub and special weapons, such as Point Sensors and Ink Mines, allowing the user of this ability to evade detection more easily. Just three ability points, or one sub, offer plenty of utility:[9][10]\n\n- The splash damage of most bombs is reduced from 30 HP to 28.6 HP. This reduction in damage provides two benefits:\nIt prevents its user from being exposed on their opponents' map by the splash damage of most single bombs.\nInk Armor will not break due to splash damage from a single bomb whose splash damage normally inflicts 30 HP of damage.\n\n- It prevents its user from being exposed on their opponents' map by the splash damage of most single bombs.\n\n- Ink Armor will not break due to splash damage from a single bomb whose splash damage normally inflicts 30 HP of damage.\n\n- The splash damage of near-misses from either Tenta Missiles or Inkjet, the minimum splash damage of bubbles, and the collision damage from Baller are all reduced from 50 HP to 48.3 HP,[11] enabling one to survive two hits from any of these specific means of special weapon damage.\n\n- It prevents its user from being exposed on their opponents' map by the splash damage of most single bombs.\n\n- Ink Armor will not break due to splash damage from a single bomb whose splash damage normally inflicts 30 HP of damage.\n\nA Carbon Roller user is expected to come in contact with the opponent's ink on various surfaces, which can both be damaging and reduce mobility. Ink Resistance Up not only partially offsets the reduction in mobility but also delays the damage taken from contact with opposing ink.[9][10]\n\n- Just three ability points, or one sub,…\n…delays the damage taken from opposing ink by 10 frames.\n…reduces the damage taken from 0.3 HP/f (health points per frame) to 0.2 HP/f.\n…lowers the limit on the amount of damage opposing ink on surfaces can inflict from 40 HP to 38 HP.\n…increases the normal running speed in opposing ink from 0.24 DU/f to 0.33 DU/f.[12]\n…increases the jumping height in opposing ink from 0.8 to 0.854.[11]\n\n- …delays the damage taken from opposing ink by 10 frames.\n\n- …reduces the damage taken from 0.3 HP/f (health points per frame) to 0.2 HP/f.\n\n- …lowers the limit on the amount of damage opposing ink on surfaces can inflict from 40 HP to 38 HP.\n\n- …increases the normal running speed in opposing ink from 0.24 DU/f to 0.33 DU/f.[12]\n\n- …increases the jumping height in opposing ink from 0.8 to 0.854.[11]\n\n- Six ability points, or two subs,…\n…delays the damage taken from opposing ink by 15 frames.\n…reduces the damage taken to 0.2 HP/f.\n…lowers the damage limit of opposing ink to 36.2 HP.\n…increases the normal running speed in opposing ink to 0.39 DU/f.[12]\n…increases the jumping height in opposing ink to 0.888.[11]\n\n- …delays the damage taken from opposing ink by 15 frames.\n\n- …reduces the damage taken to 0.2 HP/f.\n\n- …lowers the damage limit of opposing ink to 36.2 HP.\n\n- …increases the normal running speed in opposing ink to 0.39 DU/f.[12]\n\n- …increases the jumping height in opposing ink to 0.888.[11]\n\n- …delays the damage taken from opposing ink by 10 frames.\n\n- …reduces the damage taken from 0.3 HP/f (health points per frame) to 0.2 HP/f.\n\n- …lowers the limit on the amount of damage opposing ink on surfaces can inflict from 40 HP to 38 HP.\n\n- …increases the normal running speed in opposing ink from 0.24 DU/f to 0.33 DU/f.[12]\n\n- …increases the jumping height in opposing ink from 0.8 to 0.854.[11]\n\n- …delays the damage taken from opposing ink by 15 frames.\n\n- …reduces the damage taken to 0.2 HP/f.\n\n- …lowers the damage limit of opposing ink to 36.2 HP.\n\n- …increases the normal running speed in opposing ink to 0.39 DU/f.[12]\n\n- …increases the jumping height in opposing ink to 0.888.[11]\n\nIntroduced in version 4.3.0, Main Power Up increases the damage output for all rollers (but not brushes) by up to 15%. For the Carbon Roller, this means improved splatting consistency and effective ranges, even with a little investment in the ability.[9] Since the Carbon Roller lacks the Burst Bombs on its Deco variant, splatting opponents may not be as consistent. This ability will mitigate this issue.\n\nNinja Squid reduces detection by opponents while swimming on non-vertical surfaces. It allows its user to swim at full speed undetected at the cost of about 20% of the maximum swimming speed as of version 3.0.0. Because a Carbon Roller user has difficulty attacking most opponents head-on, Ninja Squid can make it easier for its user to shark and more safely approach opponents.[9]\n\n- As of Version 3.0.0, Ninja Squid reduces the maximum swim speed of the Carbon Roller from 2.02 units per frame to 1.81 units per frame.[12]\n\nQuick Respawn shortens respawn time after getting splatted (under specific conditions), encouraging a Carbon Roller user to remain aggressive even after getting splatted.[9]\n\n- 16 ability points, or one main and two subs, are enough to reduce the respawn time from 8.5 seconds to 6.67 seconds.\n\n- 26 ability points – two mains and two subs – are enough to reduce the respawn time from 8.5 seconds to 5.8 seconds.[12]\n\nSuper Jumping to a teammate after respawning carries the risk of getting splatted upon landing, due to the presence of a Super Jump indicator. When equipped, Stealth Jump better covers this indicator from long distance opponents, allowing its user to more safely return to the front lines and maintain pressure on the opponent.[9]\n\nAs a short-ranged weapon that excels at flanking, the Carbon Roller greatly benefits if it is able to swim faster. Swim Speed Up enables its user to more quickly close the distance towards an opponent, more quickly respond to an opponents' push, or even escape unfavorable situations.[9]\n\n- 16 ability points – one main and two subs – increase the swim speed from 2.02 to 2.19 units per frame.\n\n- Swim Speed Up can reduce the swim speed penalty from Ninja Squid. However, it takes at least 28 ability points – either one main and six subs or about two mains and three subs – of Swim Speed Up to fully offset the swimming speed penalty of Ninja Squid.\n\n- Therefore, a Carbon Roller user with Ninja Squid will have to decide between either having fewer ability points available for other abilities or swimming at less than the base maximum speed. For example, just 13 ability points – one main and one sub – are enough to restore the swim speed of a Carbon Roller user with Ninja Squid to 1.92 units per frame.[12][13]"
