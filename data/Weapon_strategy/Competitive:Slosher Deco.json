While the Baller could allow it to play more aggressively, the lack of bombs and how expensive the Baller is means this weapon struggles more as a slayer compared to its other variants.[2]\n\nThe Slosher Deco has the traits of a powerful slayer's weapon: high damage and medium range.\n\n- Each tap of  flings a large globule of ink in an arcing trajectory followed by a thin trail of ink:\nThis trajectory enables a Slosher Deco user to more easily attack opponents who are up on a ledge or up an incline, making it very effective at sharking beneath the opponents' perch, leading a push up walls or slopes, and taking flanking routes that require a considerable amount of climbing.\nThe arc-like trajectory also travels over obstacles that are not too tall, enabling a Slosher wield to hit opponents hiding behind them.\n\n- This trajectory enables a Slosher Deco user to more easily attack opponents who are up on a ledge or up an incline, making it very effective at sharking beneath the opponents' perch, leading a push up walls or slopes, and taking flanking routes that require a considerable amount of climbing.\n\n- The arc-like trajectory also travels over obstacles that are not too tall, enabling a Slosher wield to hit opponents hiding behind them.\n\n- So long as a Slosher Deco user is firing at at target that is not below them, the large globule consistently inflicts 70 HP of damage – just enough to splat most opponents weakened by a bomb's splash damage – while the thin ink trail inflicts 50 HP.\nUnlike most other weapons, such as shooters, the Slosher Deco only suffers damage falloff if the target is below the Slosher Deco wielder, reducing the damage by as much as 50%. Main Power Up can reduce this damage falloff.\nRegardless of any damage falloff, the large globule always delivers more damage than the thin trail of ink. Whenever possible, aim the reticle at your opponent to hit them with the large globule.\n\n- Unlike most other weapons, such as shooters, the Slosher Deco only suffers damage falloff if the target is below the Slosher Deco wielder, reducing the damage by as much as 50%.

Whenever possible, aim the reticle at your opponent to hit them with the large globule.\n\n- In addition to its high damage, the Slosher Deco also has good range for a slayer's weapon (about 140 DU). Although this weapon has low range when aiming the reticle at the default position (), you can always aim higher to maximize your range. — enough to outrange most shooters and dualies.\n\n- The Slosher Deco suffers from a few notable drawbacks: slow firing rate, low mobility, and low ink efficiency.\nIts slow firing rate (12-16 frames before first shot, 30 frames between shots) allows a fully healthy opponent using a rapid firing shooter to potentially absorb one Slosher Deco shot and still splat the wielder before the latter can fire their second shot.\nA Slosher Deco wielder is slowed down during (0.4 DU/f while firing) and after firing a shot (16 frames until either using a sub weapon or morphing into squid/octopus form) more than most shooter users are, making it a sitting target for opponents to exploit.\nThe Slosher Deco's ink consumption (7%) is rather high for a slayer's weapon. Repetitive tapping of  – particularly after throwing a Sprinkler – will quickly deplete the ink tank. Watch the ink tank and avoid traveling too far in the opponents' turf.\n\n- Its slow firing rate (12-16 frames before first shot, 30 frames between shots) allows a fully healthy opponent using a rapid firing shooter to potentially absorb one Slosher Deco shot and still splat the wielder before the latter can fire their second shot.\n\n- A Slosher Deco wielder is slowed down during (0.4 DU/f while firing) and after firing a shot (16 frames until either using a sub weapon or morphing into squid/octopus form) more than most shooter users are, making it a sitting target for opponents to exploit.\n\n- The Slosher Deco's ink consumption (7%) is rather high for a slayer's weapon.

Repetitive tapping of  – particularly after throwing a Sprinkler – will quickly deplete the ink tank. Watch the ink tank and avoid traveling too far in the opponents' turf.\n\nThe Sprinkler can be used in a variety of ways to help its user:\n\n- Turfing areas that are either out of reach or unsafe to approach, building up the special gauge.\n\n- Maintaining turf onto highly contested areas, such as on the Tower. A Sprinkler placed high on a wall or ceiling can also be a distraction for an opponent.\n\n- Acting as a light shield in a pinch. Sprinklers have 120 hit points but are easily destroyed by opponents armed with Object Shredder.\n\nThe Baller is a versatile special weapon with a variety of uses:\n\n- Taking control of a certain area of the stage, such as a Splat Zone or underneath the opponents' Clam basket.\n\n- Forcing the opponents to clear an area, whether leading a Tower or Rainmaker push or stopping one.\n\n- Providing its user an extra layer of protection, such as when fleeing an unsafe situation or while riding the Tower at a checkpoint. In the latter case, be wary of getting knocked off of the Tower by the opponents' weapons.\n\n- After the Baller's explosion, nearby opponents not splatted are often damaged enough for one or two hits from either the main or sub weapon to splat them.\n\n- Baller can be used to survive a Splashdown, although the Baller is instantly destroyed.\n\n- The Slosher Deco has a handful of combos it can perform with Baller:\nThe splash damage of the explosion (55 damage) combined with a slosh (70 damage) will splat an opponent. The Slosher Deco's range allows it to pull off this combo, but keep in mind that the closer to the opponent when exploding, the better.\nAlthough the Baller takes 50 frames to grant the user protection, contact damage from it is active when the special starts. Hitting an opponent with a slosh (70 damage) and bumping into them with the Baller (50 damage) will splat them.\n\n- The splash damage of the explosion (55 damage) combined with a slosh (70 damage) will splat an opponent.

Hitting an opponent with a slosh (70 damage) and bumping into them with the Baller (50 damage) will splat them.\n\nThe Slosher Deco can play more aggressively than its standard variant, but not as aggressively as the Soda Slosher, due to a lack of bombs and an expensive Baller. This lack of bombs means that it can struggle to find a slot in some team compositions.[3]\nWhile not a poor turfing weapon, the Slosher Deco greatly benefits if teamed up with a weapon that is more efficient at turfing, such as a Splattershot Jr. or an N-ZAP '85.\n\n- Matchups between Sloshers on opposing teams are determined by each player's skill, positioning, turf control, and the presence of any teammates.\n\n- A few slayer and support weapons outrange the Slosher Deco without sacrificing too much mobility, making them good counters. For example, variants of the Splattershot Pro, the H-3 Nozzlenose, and the Dualie Squelchers all have better range and firing rate than the Slosher Deco.\n\n- To attack an opposing Slosher Deco user with a shorter-ranged weapon, rely more on flanking or sharking to get close to them, then if possible, exploit their slow fire rate. Watch out for the Baller combo, however. (see above)\n\n- A long-ranged weapon, such as a charger or most splatlings, can attack an opposing Slosher Deco user from long distance with impunity. However, once the opposing Slosher Deco gets close, the tables are turned, as it can outmaneuver and outdraw its less mobile, slower firing opponent.\n\n- A competent Slosher Deco user is likely capable at both flanking and sharking:\nKeep track of all four members of the opposing team – which ones are present, which ones are splatted, and which ones are back at their spawn point.\nCheck the map periodically for opposing ink forming around flanks to anticipate a flanking attack.\nTo prevent sharking, check suspicious puddles of the opponents' ink, preferably with a thrown sub weapon.\nWeapons that track opponents, such as Point Sensors, temporarily prevent an opponent from sharking and makes them an easier target for long-ranged teammates to pick off.\n\n- Keep track of all four members of the opposing team – which ones are present, which ones are splatted, and which ones are back at their spawn point.\n\n- Check the map periodically for opposing ink forming around flanks to anticipate a flanking attack.\n\n- To prevent sharking, check suspicious puddles of the opponents' ink, preferably with a thrown sub weapon.\n\n- Weapons that track opponents, such as Point Sensors, temporarily prevent an opponent from sharking and makes them an easier target for long-ranged teammates to pick off.\n\n- When pursued by a Slosher Deco, using almost any sub weapon (except for Squid Beakons) can either delay their pursuit or deter them from chasing.\n\n- If an opponent's Sprinkler is present nearby, make sure that no opponents are hiding nearby before attempting to destroy it.\n\n- If multiple players are in the firing range of an enemy Baller, concentrate fire to quickly destroy and pop it. Both bombs and Object Shredder can help speed up the destruction and pop of a Baller. Bombs that strike an enemy Baller will immediately detonate, not only damaging it but also damaging or splatting any of the Baller user's teammates nearby.\n\n- Non-damaging subs, such as Toxic Mist or even Point Sensors, can slow down a Baller. Toxic Mist will have the same effects to Baller as it does players as of version 5.2.0 and Point Sensors can knock the Baller back.\n\n- Splashdown can destroy a Baller if executed before the Baller initiates its explosion. The Baller's user will remain unsplatted, so prepare a follow-up attack.\n\n- In Tower Control, fire at an enemy Baller at a proper angle to knock it off of the Tower. With a mesh brim surrounding the Tower, the Baller cannot climb back on without the assistance of another structure.\n\n- Keep track of all four members of the opposing team – which ones are present, which ones are splatted, and which ones are back at their spawn point.\n\n- Check the map periodically for opposing ink forming around flanks to anticipate a flanking attack.\n\n- To prevent sharking, check suspicious puddles of the opponents' ink, preferably with a thrown sub weapon.\n\n- Weapons that track opponents, such as Point Sensors, temporarily prevent an opponent from sharking and makes them an easier target for long-ranged teammates to pick off.\n\nGear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.\n\nA Slosher Deco user in a slayer role generally gets close enough to the opponent and their bombs. Ever since its introduction in version 4.3.0, Bomb Defense Up DX will not only reduce the damage taken from opposing sub and special weapons that are not one-hit-splat but will also reduce the duration of the tracking effects of certain opponent's sub and special weapons, such as Point Sensors and Ink Mines, allowing the user of this ability to evade detection more easily.\n\n- Just three ability points - one sub - has a lot of utility. This includes, but is not limited to:\nInk Armor will not break due to splash damage from bombs and other explosives that do 30 damage.\nTwo near-misses from Inkjet, two bumps from a Baller, and splash damage from two bubbles from Bubble Blower will not splat the user.\nGetting hit by splash damage from a bomb will not make the user visible on the map.\n\n- Ink Armor will not break due to splash damage from bombs and other explosives that do 30 damage.\n\n- Two near-misses from Inkjet, two bumps from a Baller, and splash damage from two bubbles from Bubble Blower will not splat the user.\n\n- Getting hit by splash damage from a bomb will not make the user visible on the map.\n\n- Ink Armor will not break due to splash damage from bombs and other explosives that do 30 damage.\n\n- Two near-misses from Inkjet, two bumps from a Baller, and splash damage from two bubbles from Bubble Blower will not splat the user.\n\n- Getting hit by splash damage from a bomb will not make the user visible on the map.\n\nUnless a Slosher Deco wielder is on an extended splatting streak, they can expect to get splatted often. When equipped, Comeback grants 10 ability points of six different stackable abilities for twenty seconds after respawning from getting splatted by an opponent:\n\n- Ink Recovery Up\n\n- Ink Saver (Main)\n\n- Ink Saver (Sub)\n\n- Run Speed Up\n\n- Swim Speed Up\n\n- Special Charge Up\n\nBecause the Slosher Deco consumes ink quickly, both Ink Saver (Main) and Ink Recovery Up are the most useful for a Slosher Deco user, allowing them to pursue and pressure the opponent upon returning from spawn with less worry about their ink efficiency. In addition, Special Charge Up will offset the high special gauge for the Baller.\n\nAny good slayer like a Slosher Deco user is expected to come in contact with the opponent's ink on various surfaces, which can both be damaging and reduce mobility. Ink Resistance Up not only partially offsets the reduction in mobility but also delays the damage taken from contact with opposing ink.\n\n- Just three ability points – or one sub – delays the damage taken from opposing ink by 10 frames, reduces the damage taken from 0.3 HP/f (health points per frame) to 0.2 HP/f, and increases the normal running speed in opposing ink from 0.24 DU/f to 0.33 DU/f.[4]\n\nQuick Respawn shortens respawn time after getting splatted (under specific conditions), encouraging a Slosher Deco user to remain aggressive even after getting splatted.\n\n- 16 ability points – one main and two subs – are enough to reduce the respawn time from 8.5 seconds to 6.67 seconds.[4]\n\n- 26 ability points – two mains and two subs – are enough to reduce the respawn time from 8.5 seconds to 5.8 seconds.[4]\n\nWhen splatted, half of the special gauge progress is lost. For example, a player with 180p of special gauge out of 210p upon getting splatted will lose 90p of the special gauge. Due to the Slosher Deco having a 210p special gauge for Baller, having some Special Saver equipped allows them to preserve more of their special gauge progress in case they ever get splatted.\n\n- 6 ability points – two subs – are enough to increase the amount of special gauge progress saved from 50% to 64.6%.[4]\n\nSuper Jumping to a teammate after respawning carries the risk of getting splatted upon landing, due to the appearance of a Super Jump indicator. When equipped, Stealth Jump better covers this indicator from long distance opponents, allowing its user to more safely return to the front lines and maintain pressure on the opponent.\n[5]\n\nThe Slosher Deco returns in Splatoon 3, with a slightly altered design. This time, it comes with Angle Shooter, which has a multitude of uses, and the Zipcaster, which can be used to reposition quickly.\n\nThe Slosher is a powerful main weapon that has similarities to other slayer weapons.\n\n- Its sloshes come out quickly and with power.\n\n- The Slosher Deco's sloshes fly in an arc, allowing the player to hit opponents over terrain and obstacles.\n\n- The Slosher Deco has a slow fire rate for slayer weapons, but deals a great amount of damage.\n\n- Attacking from higher ground will decrease the damage of the Slosher Deco, so try to stay on the same level or below the opponent.\n\nThe Angle Shooter can provide useful too.\n\n- A direct Angle Shooter hit and a 70.0 damage slosh will result in over 100.0 damage being dealt, enough to splat an opponent. However, this combo will not work if the opponent has enough AP of Sub Resistance Up or the 70.0 damage hitbox of the slosh has fallen too much.\n\n- The Angle Shooter can be used to annoy opponents out of range of the Slosher Deco, as it deals damage, marks them, and paints their feet.\n\n- Angle Shooter can poke opponents at a distance in neutral, and can mark them if they decide to make an advance.\n\n- The threat of being marked by a tripwire can force opponents down more predictable avenues of approach, or discourage them from retreating to safety.\n\n- The Angle Shooter bounces between surfaces, allowing to hit opponents from behind terrain. It may be difficult to see opponents from behind terrain, but if one walks into the tripwire, they get marked.\n\n- The Angle Shooter can be used to quickly paint the player's feet when being overwhelmed with enemy ink or to paint faraway surfaces. Multiple shallow bounces on uneven terrain can increase the overall paint value of a single Angle Shooter.\n\n- The player and their teammates can use the tracking capabilities of the Angle Shooter to hunt opponents down. The player can do this shortly before using Zipcaster to pursue them.\n\nThe Zipcaster can be used to surprise and confuse opponents.\n\n- The Zipcaster can get the player closer to opponents out of range quickly and to splat them with the Slosher Deco.\n\n- Zipping into an opponent and the explosion that occurs when colliding with terrain can combo with the slosh of the Slosher Deco, so use this to your advantage to splat opponents.\n\n- The Slosher itself flings a big projectile that deals good damage even after falling, so the player can use the Zipcaster to stay suspended in the air and slosh at opponents from above.\n\n- If the player takes a lot of damage during fights, they can use the Zipcaster to zip away from opponents and submerge in ink and heal, take a breather, and assess the situation. When the player heals, they can continue to rest or splat the opponent that was chasing them. This is generally only advised if there are allies around to protect your Zipcaster marker or if the player has Drop Roller, as this may enable the pursuer to splat the player, as the Slosher Deco cannot splat opponents fast enough to guard their marker.\n\n- While not bad at turfing, it can benefit from an ally that can turf quickly, such as the Splattershot Jr., that can take control of areas quickly.\n\n- Backlines that can watch over and control areas, such as the Z+F Splat Charger can guard the Slosher Deco's Zipcaster marker, as to ensure the player is not splatted.\n\n- Weapons with generally low range or kill power, such as the Aerospray RG can benefit from the aid of the Slosher Deco in fights.\n\n- Weapons with higher range and firing speed than the Slosher Deco, such as the Dualie Squelchers can be good in defeating a Slosher Deco user.\n\n- Using almost any sub weapon against a Slosher Deco user can repel them from the player.\n\n- The Slosher Deco has somewhat slow endlag and doesn't paint that well, so anything that quickly paints around it can trap it for you or your teammates to finish off.\n\nGear abilities can be useful for a Slosher Deco user.\n\nSpecial Power Up increases the duration of Zipcaster. Zipcaster generally has a short duration, so having an extended special time can prove useful.\n\nSince the Slosher Deco may get splatted a lot, Quick Respawn can be used to counteract mistakes made.\n\nComeback is viable on the Slosher Deco because it has Zipcaster. Zipcaster users may get splatted a lot when using the special, so Comeback can be used to get back into the game quickly.\n\nSub Power Up increases the tracking duration of the Angle Shooter. An extended tracking time can help the Slosher Deco's teammates and keep track of opponents longer.\n\nDrop Roller can help the player avoid fatal situations in which an opponent is camping the player's super jump/Zipcaster markers.\n\nThe Slosher Deco is a pretty strong weapon, but is generally not picked much in competitive. The Angle Shooter was weak for most of Splatoon 3's lifespan, and the Zipcaster still is. The Slosher also outclasses the Slosher Deco as it generally has the better kit.\n\nCurrently, the Slosher Deco is not picked much above the much-higher-in-the-meta Slosher, but is still regarded as a fun weapon, so players look to see more of it."
