    "The Tri-Slosher functions similarly but with minor differences.",
    "Disruptor while not as versatile as a bomb, can provide a Tri-Slosher user with many advantages.",
    "The Bubbler is a very useful special and can easily turn the tables of a battle:",
    "While Disruptor may be useful in some circumstances, having no bomb — particularly either Splat or Suction Bombs can put a team at a disadvantage for a few reasons;",
    "Gear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.",
    "Unless a Tri-Slosher user is on an extended splatting streak, they can expect to get splatted often. When equipped, Comeback grants 12 ability points of six different stackable abilities for twenty seconds after respawning from getting splatted by an opponent:",
    "All of these abilities benefit a Tri-Slosher, making it more ink efficient, move faster, and pairs well with the weapon's middle special depletion to obtain Bubbler faster on respawn.",
    "Quick Respawn will always shorten respawn time after getting splatted in this game, encouraging a Tri-Slosher user to remain aggressive even after getting splatted and is in general useful for brute forcing your way back into the stage.",
    "Super Jumping to a teammate after respawning carries the risk of getting splatted upon landing, due to the appearance of a Super Jump indicator. When equipped, Stealth Jump hides this marker completely at the cost of a slower Super Jump both in startup and the jump itself. This pairs well with Quick Respawn.",
    "Compared to the original Slosher, the Tri-Slosher has a quicker, shorter-ranged attack that is thrown in three directions, allowing it to turf more thoroughly. It also has a more aggressive kit than that of both its other variant, the Tri-Slosher Nouveau, and the Slosher, encouraging its user to apply constant pressure onto their opponents.",
    "The traits of the Tri-Slosher make it a quintessential slayer's weapon:",
    "The instant explosion and good ink efficiency of Burst Bombs offer a Tri-Slosher user plenty of uses:",
    "Ink Armor enables its user's team to either initiate a push, to recapture a Splat Zone for example, or maintain one, such as while locking out the opponent.",
    "While a team might get away with having one or two users of short-ranged weapons, such as the Tri-Slosher, having a team composition with too many short-ranged weapons and no longer-ranged weapons to provide support fire is often disadvantageous for a number of reasons:[11]",
    "While the Tri-Slosher's Burst Bombs are versatile, they lack certain advantages offered by lethal bombs — particularly either Splat or Suction Bombs, which provide their user's team a couple advantages over another team that has no lethal bombs in its composition:[11]",
    "Multiple Ink Armors used by the same team do not stack. Therefore, it would be redundant for a team to have more than two Ink Armor users.[11]",
    "While special weapons used in combination are beneficial in general, the combination of Ink Armor with either Inkjet or Ultra Stamp is particularly invaluable for the user of the latter special, improving their survivability:",
    "Gear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.",
    "Ever since its introduction in version 4.3.0, Bomb Defense Up DX will not only reduce the damage taken from opposing sub and special weapons that are not one-hit-splat but will also reduce the duration of the tracking effects of certain opponent's sub and special weapons, such as Point Sensors and Ink Mines, allowing the user of this ability to evade detection more easily. Because the Tri-Slosher is a powerful short-ranged weapon, its user can greatly benefit from reducing the damage taken from their opponents' bombs. Just three ability points, or one sub, offer plenty of utility:[12][13]",
    "Unless a Tri-Slosher wielder is on an extended splatting streak, they can expect to get splatted often. When equipped, Comeback grants 10 ability points of six different stackable abilities for twenty seconds after respawning from getting splatted by an opponent:",
    "The former three abilities and Swim Speed Up are particularly useful for the Tri-Slosher, allowing it to consume less ink and maintain pressure on the opponent upon returning from spawn.[12]",
    "A Tri-Slosher user is expected to come in contact with the opponent's ink on various surfaces, which can both be damaging and reduce mobility. Ink Resistance Up not only partially offsets the reduction in mobility but also delays the damage taken from contact with opposing ink.[12][13]",
    "Quick Respawn shortens respawn time after getting splatted (under specific conditions), encouraging the Tri-Slosher to remain aggressive even after getting splatted.",
    "Quick Super Jump decreases both the \"charge\" time before and the travel time of a Super Jump. Tri-Slosher users who include this ability will benefit since Quick Super Jump allows them to both return to the front lines more quickly and escape unfavorable situations more easily to preserve special gauge progress.[12][13]",
    "When splatted, half of the special gauge progress is lost. For example, a player with 150p of special gauge out of 190p upon getting splatted will lose 75p of the special gauge. Special Saver allows its user to keep more of their special gauge progress whenever they are splatted. This allows a Tri-Slosher user to more quickly build up Ink Armor after respawning.[12][13]",
    "Super Jumping to a teammate after respawning carries the risk of getting splatted upon landing, due to the appearance of a Super Jump indicator. When equipped, Stealth Jump better covers this indicator from long distance opponents, allowing its user to more safely return to the front lines and maintain pressure on the opponent.",
    "A self-explanatory ability, Swim Speed Up enables an already mobile Tri-Slosher user to more rapidly close the distance towards an opponent, more quickly respond to an opponents' push, or even escape unfavorable situations.",
    "[15]",
    "Upon Splatoon 2's release, the Tri-Slosher gained infamy for being the defining slayer weapon. It had a Burst Bomb combo reminiscent of the standard Slosher in the first Splatoon and a cheap special gauge of 180p for Ink Armor, a special that was even stronger than it is currently due to it not having any knockback or damage bleed. Even after a major nerf in version 1.1.2 that increased its special gauge to 210p, the weapon was still a strong pick with some teams running multiple Tri-Sloshers in their compositions.[16] However, version 1.3.0 nerfed the Tri-Slosher's damage output from 62 to 52, and its range, making it less likely to get a two-shot splat from higher elevations.[17] In addition, Ink Armor received nerfs that added bleedthrough damage and knockback when the armor breaks, in addition to a reduced invulnerability time. After these nerfs, the Tri-Slosher largely fell out of the competitive scene until the release of version 2.0.0, which brought the Tri-Slosher a handful of buffs, giving it 62 damage once again, increasing its movement speed while firing, and shrinking its special gauge from 210p to 190p. While the weapon did not rise to the top once again, it did manage to carve a niche on stages such as Blackbelly Skatepark, due to the stage favoring short-ranged weapons and having uneven terrain from which it could attack from safely.",
    "The Tri-Slosher continued getting some quality-of-life buffs, such as becoming a lightweight weapon in 4.2.0 and removing the weapon's \"deadzones\" in 5.0.0, where opponents could be in front of the user and still not take any damage. Finally, in 5.2.0, the weapon received another buff where it would slosh two frames faster than it would before, slightly improving its time to splat an opponent. Throughout this time period, opinions on the weapon became more and more positive, from being perceived as low tier by competitive player Chara in 4.6.0[18] and 4.8.0[19] due to inconsistent hitboxes and lack of range, to being placed in the top tiers in his 5.3.0[20] and 5.5.0 tier lists, as the problems with the weapon he previously mentioned were fixed by that time. He even claimed that the vanilla Tri-Slosher had the potential to be the best slosher, as it could handle short-ranged shooters and special spam easily due to its high mobility. However, the weapon does need a team composition built around it and could struggle on stages that favor long range.",

    "- Before the Bubbler runs out, the Bubbler will flash, indicating the user that the Bubbler will end soon. Use the remaining time to escape, as a Tri-Slosher user can be taken by surprise.",
    "- Bubbler can be shared with teammates by getting close to them. This can be useful to allow two players to be under the effect of Bubbler and push, or to save someone from getting splatted.",
    "- Although the Bubbler is invincible, its one weakness is the knockback it receives. Simply shooting at a Bubbler will either push or hold them back.\nBe careful of any bombs, as they will push the player back farther than with just the main weapon.\nUnlike Kraken, the Bubbler user still can use their main weapon, which they can use to attack the opponent or to escape.",
    "- Since special weapons are also free ink tank refills, a Tri-Slosher user can throw Disruptors after activating Bubbler as a panic button to prevent opponents from fleeing, then quickly reverse the situation and splat them.[1]",

    "- Its high damage (62 health points, or HP, per hit), relatively quick rate of fire for a slosher-class weapon (12-16 frames for the first shot, 24 frames between shots), and Burst Bombs all translate into quick two-shot splats, making it deadly in both flanking and sharking.[4]",
    "- Its range (120 DU) is just longer than that of both the Splattershot and the N-ZAP '85 (116.99 DU)[5] but shorter than that of the .52 Gal (124.944 DU).[5] This range, combined with its wide shot spread, makes it difficult for users of shorter-ranged weapons – particularly brushes and most rollers – to safely approach an opposing Tri-Slosher user.",
    "- The Tri-Slosher's lightweight nature and Burst Bombs give it more inherent mobility than many other slayer's weapons, allowing its user to either pursue opponents or escape unfavorable matchups more easily.",
    "- Both the main weapon's wide shots and its Burst Bombs enable its user to rapidly turf large areas to either gain or maintain map control and quickly either capture or contest Splat Zones.\nMain Power Up increases the Tri-Slosher's ink coverage by up to 20%.[6]",
    "- The arc-like trajectory of the Tri-Slosher's shots has a couple unique applications:\nShots can be fired up a ledge or incline more easily than a shooter's shots can, making it valuable for both sharking beneath short perches and pushing up slopes or walls.\nShots can also be launched over some obstacles, hitting opponents who may hide behind them.",
    "- While quick at both splatting and turfing, the Tri-Slosher does have a few weaknesses:\nLike other slosher-class weapons, its rate of fire is slower than that of most shooters. While both the Tri-Slosher and the Splattershot have similar ranges, the Splattershot has a quicker splatting time (35 damage, 3-11 frames for the first shot, 6 frames between shots, totaling 15-23 frames to reach 100 HP damage) than the Tri-Slosher (36-40 frames); even the N-ZAP '85 has a quicker splatting time (28 damage, 3-11 frames for the first shot, 5 frames between shots, totaling 18-26 frames) than the Tri-Slosher.\nSuper Jump camping can also be tricky because of the slower firing rate. To splat a Super Jumping opponent at their landing spot, take advantage of the lack of falloff damage by firing a globule of ink above the marker a little before the opponent lands, then fire right when the opponent lands and, if you timed your first shot correctly, you should be able to splat the opponent.[7].\nWhile more mobile than other slosher-class weapons, the Tri-Slosher still has less mobility (0.66 DU/f) than weapons of comparable range, such as the Splattershot (0.72 DU/f) and the N-ZAP '85 (0.84 DU/f). This reduced mobility makes its user an easier target for long-ranged opponents to pick off.\nThe Tri-Slosher consumes ink more quickly than most shooters. Aimlessly flailing it around will rapidly deplete the ink tank, leaving its user very vulnerable. Watch the ink tank and avoid traveling too far in the opponents' turf.",

    "- Upon activation, Ink Armor will protect its user and their teammates except for those either carrying the Rainmaker or using either Baller or Booyah Bomb.\nAlso, players protected by Ink Armor lose it upon gaining possession of the Rainmaker.\nAs a slayer, a Tri-Slosher user is not expected to carry the Rainmaker. Instead, they should engage any opposing defenders and turf a path of ink for the Rainmaker carrier to quickly travel along. Therefore, while Ink Armor will not protect the Rainmaker carrier, it will still benefit their teammates, so cast Ink Armor just before engaging the opposing team.",

    "- Their lethal explosion provides space for its user's team to either push into an area held by the opponent or stall an opponent's push.",
    "- In general, when two Ink Armor-based weapons are on a team, the user of the more aggressive weapon should activate Ink Armor first, freeing them to engage the opponent without potentially losing both a potential Ink Armor and special gauge progress. Therefore, the Tri-Slosher user should generally be the first to activate Ink Armor, while their more supportive teammate should activate their Ink Armor as the first one wears off.",
    "- Because an Ink Armored player can withstand more damage — especially from an opponent's charger, an armored Inkjet pilot can fly more aggressively.",
    "- An armored Ultra Stamp user is also more difficult for opponents to splat while swinging the hammer. However, they are easier to spot when submerged in their ink.",
    "- Both Bomb Defense Up DX and Ink Resistance Up – already valuable utility abilities – provide various measures of protection against an opposing Tri-Slosher user:[12][13]\nBomb Defense Up DX reduces the amount of damage taken from both direct hits and splash damage by Burst Bombs.\nInk Resistance Up not only partially offsets the reduction in mobility but also delays the passive damage taken from opposing ink resulting from being hit by either a Tri-Slosher or a Burst Bomb.",
    "- Like most roller users, a Tri-Slosher user tends to thrive when they are sharking beneath short ledges. You can take a few proactive measures:\nRemain farther back on a ledge to avoid any arc damage.\nHave a means to back up and retreat. Do not attempt to fight back until you have a clear line of sight of the opposing Clash Blaster Neo.",
    "- Matchups between Tri-Slosher users on opposing teams are determined by each player's skill, positioning, turf control, and the presence of any teammates.",
    "- Any weapon that has a combination of longer range, better accuracy, or higher damage output without sacrificing too much mobility can counter a Tri-Slosher. For example, both the L-3 Nozzlenose and Dualie Squelchers and their respective variants meet all of these requirements. However, beware of any Burst Bombs the opposing Tri-Slosher wielder might throw.",
    "- The wielder of a shorter ranged, quicker firing weapon should flank, shark, or outmaneuver (e.g. via dodge rolling) the Tri-Slosher to exploit its slower firing rate.",
    "- A long-ranged weapon, such as a charger or most splatlings, can attack a Tri-Slosher from long distance with impunity. However, once the Tri-Slosher gets close, the tables are turned, as it can outmaneuver and outdraw its less mobile, slower firing opponent.",
    "- A competent Tri-Slosher user is likely capable at both flanking and sharking:\nKeep track of all four members of the opposing team – which ones are present, which ones are splatted, and which ones are back at their spawn point.\nCheck the map periodically for opposing ink forming around flanks to anticipate a flanking attack.\nTo prevent sharking, check suspicious puddles of the opponents' ink, preferably with a thrown sub weapon.\nWeapons that track opponents, such as Point Sensors, temporarily prevent an opponent from sharking and makes them an easier target for long-ranged teammates to pick off.",
    "- When pursued by a Tri-Slosher, using almost any sub weapon (except for Squid Beakons) can either delay their pursuit or deter them from chasing.",
    "- Keep an eye on the HUD to know when the opponent's Tri-Slosher has Ink Armor ready to use, and both watch and listen for when it is activated.\nThe best way to prevent the opponent from using armor is to splat the opponent with the Tri-Slosher (or any other Ink Armor-equipped weapon). For example, a charger user can prioritize said opponent when sniping.\nFight fire with fire by having and using Ink Armor to counter the opposing Tri-Slosher user's Armor. Skirmishes between armored teams will depend on when each Ink Armor was activated, the players' skill and positioning, turf control, and the availability of other specials.\nInk Armor can negate up to 30 HP of damage, so there are a few main and sub weapons that can remove an opponent's Ink Armor in one hit:\nFor example, Burst Bombs and all variants of the Splattershot, the Splattershot Pro, and the Splat Dualies all inflict at least 30 HP of damage per shot and fire relatively rapidly. All variants of the Splash-o-matic and the Dualie Squelchers can also accomplish this with enough Main Power Up.\nObject Shredder triples damage inflicted onto armored opponents, allowing weapons that cannot otherwise inflict 30 HP of damage to break an opponent's Ink Armor in one hit.[12] Combining Object Shredder with Ink Storm can nearly neutralize armored pushes by the opponent.\nThe splash damage of most bombs will destroy the Ink Armor of opponents who have no Bomb Defense Up DX equipped.[12][13][14]\nOtherwise, focus fire on armored opponents for longer than usual - preferably while ganging up on one opponent at a time - to compensate for their armor.",

    "- Swim Speed Up can reduce the swim speed penalty from Ninja Squid. However, it takes at least 28 ability points – either one main and six subs or about two mains and three subs – of Swim Speed Up for a Tri-Slosher user to fully offset the swimming speed penalty of Ninja Squid.[6]",
    "- Therefore, a Tri-Slosher user with Ninja Squid will have to decide between either having fewer ability points available for other abilities or swimming at less than the base maximum speed. For example, just 13 ability points – one main and one sub – are enough to restore the swim speed of a Tri-Slosher user with Ninja Squid to 1.92 units per frame.[6]"
