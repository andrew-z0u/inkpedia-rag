    "Like Splatana Wiper, Wiper Deco fills a similar role to the vanilla kit, however with a less aggressive loadout and a lack of a poking bomb, this kit plays more of a supporting role rather than a pure aggressive skirmisher.",
    "The Splatana Wiper as a main weapon, with its consistent long-range damage, high mobility, and close ranged one shot fit the role of a skirmisher.",
    "The Splatana Wiper has two different ways of attacking:",
    "- Charged slashes deal consistent 60 damage when not close, allowing reliable splatting if the user can track the opponent.\nOpponents up close to a Splatana Wiper user can be splatted in one hit with a charged slash, which can be useful against flankers.\nThey also ink a solid trail of ink, allowing the weapon to paint fairly well.\nIf holding the L stick forward while doing a charged slash, the user will dash forward before performing the slash. Use this to get close to opponents, although be careful of any bombs in the way.",
    "- Uncharged slashes, while quicker, deal less damage at 30. While not the main way to splat opponents, the user can combo 2 uncharged slashes with a charged slash for a quicker splat time. In addition, Splatana Wiper Deco can combo either a charged slash (or two uncharged) with the 50 damage hit of missiles for a quicker splat time. The user can also combo three changed slashed with the 30 damage missiles hit.",
    "- At point blank range, the damage scales up to 45, making the kill time one slash faster. It isn't recommended to do this, however, unless your enemy has run out of ink.\nUncharged slashes will leave a trail of ink with no gaps in between. This along with its fast strafe speed, will help enhance its mobility, paint and to capture zones in Splat Zones.",
    "- With its range and no falloff damage, users should stay close to the frontlines, but not too close to take advantage of its range to splat opponents.",
    "- Be careful of any walls that may be above an opponent, as the ink flung from the Splatana Wiper will disappear as it touches a wall, shortening the range.",
    "- Another strength of the Splatana Wiper is its mobility, allowing the user to evade ink shots quickly.",
    "The Splatana Wiper Deco also has some weaknesses.",
    "- Its linear ink line from the charged slash is very thin. The user will have to be accurate in order to finish opponents.",
    "- The kill time with the uncharged slashes is relatively slow compared to other weapons of the same range, this isn't helped by a lack of a poking bomb meaning it needs to rely on its special or teammates for help with its kill time.\nA lack of a poking bomb also means it needs to rely on its Tenta Missiles upon retake if its beakons get destroyed.",
    "- It is not viable to run two weapons with Squid Beakons in the same weapon composition. As such in a coronated environment, running Wiper Deco effectively locks compositions out of common weapons such as Tenta Brella and Custom Dualie Squelchers.",
    "Squid Beakons, despite not being a bomb, have unique synergy with the weapon.",
    "- Out of all the weapon sets with Squid Beakons, Splatana Wiper Deco has some of the best mobility. This allows it to very quickly set up beakons in annoying positions on the map.\nIn addition, Beakons allow it to jump back into good skirmishing positions upon respawning.\nBeakons also allow the user to jump behind the enemy team, which can be useful in team fights.",
    "- Beakons allow it to jump out and reposition without super jumping back to spawn, meaning it doesn't have to get out of spawn and back into position.\nRunning 1 sub each of Quick Super Jump and Sub Power Up reduces its vulnerable jump frames to its Beakons from 80 frames to 49[1], a faster jump-out time decreases the chances of the user being splatted mid-jump.",
    "- Beakons allow a wiped team to quickly jump back into a fight, preventing the match from snowballing into a knockout.",
    "- Beakons provide a location effect, enemy players near a friendly Squid Beakon will be displayed on the map. This allows the user and their teammates to gain intel on the enemy player's position in addition to knowledge of if an enemy player is in the area before jumping to one.",
    "- Squid Beakons can function as bait, place one in an open area and hide near it.\nThis won't work for longer-ranged weapons, as they can destroy the Beakon from a distance.",
    "- As a general rule of thumb, place Beakons in hidden areas with lots of stage geometry to protect jumps and make it difficult for enemies to access and break the Beakon.\nPlacing Beakons in spawn is not recommended as the player can Super Jump to spawn at any time by pressing down on the D-Pad.\nIn addition, placing Beakons right before going into an engagement is discouraged, due to its 75% ink cost.",
    "Tenta Missiles if used correctly can easily flip the game into the favor of their user's team.",
    "- Wiper Deco struggles against longer ranged weapons, such as E-Liter(scope), Ballpoint Splatling and Jet Squelcher. Coincidentally, these weapons struggle against Tenta Missiles and other forms of displacement.\nThe amount of Tenta Missiles fired depends on how many targets were locked on upon launch.\nOne Target - Ten Missiles\nTwo Targets - Five Missiles each\nThree to Five - four Missiles each\nTo displace an enemy anchor, it is recommended to only lock onto them, firing 10 missiles directly at them, this should give the user an opening in which to push without the anchor putting pressure on them.\nLocking onto two - four targets is recommended during offensive pushes or defensive stops.\nLocking onto enemy players to push them off of the objective (or to directly chip the carrier in Rainmaker) can also be useful. Especially during Overtime.",
    "- During, and temporarily after firing Tenta Missiles, there is a location effect shown to the user, similar to Thermal Ink or Echolocator. In a coronated environment with callouts, this allows the user to get recon on 1-4 enemy players, and callout their position to their teammates.\nEven in solo play, this recon can still be useful for checking and preventing enemy players from flanking.",
    "- Due to the nerf in Splatoon 3 Version 2.0, Tenta Missiles have a 10 second cool down between activating the special and being able to build another missiles; because of this it is advised to use Missiles with purpose rather than mindlessly spam them. Don't immediately activate the special as soon as it is fully charged.",
    "Despite Wiper's good object damage, especially to Splash Walls, due to its slow kill time and lack of a poking bomb, a well placed wall can help protect weapons while they attack the Wiper.",
    "52. Gal has very slightly less range than Splatana Wipers charged slash, with a fast two shot a good .52 Gal user can splat the Wiper user behind the protection of its Splash Wall before the Wiper in turn destroys the wall.",
    "- Killer Wail 5.1 can also be helpful during an engagement. Despite Wail not helping .52 Gal's time to kill, the displacement provided can help keep the Wiper distracted while the .52 Gal user is shooting at it.",
    "Squeezer is similar to .52 Gal, having similar range to Splattershot Pro. With its Splash Wall the Squeezer user can space out the Wiper User and remain protected.",
    "Splatana Wiper Deco struggles against weapons with longer range than it, as these weapons can space it out, and a lack of a poking bomb means Wiper struggles at dealing with these weapons without the help of its teammates or its special. In Addition, these weapons typically run Respawn Punisher which hurts Wiper Deco due to the increased respawn time and loss to its special gauge.",
    "Splat Charger, Z+F Splat Charger, E-Liter 4K, and Custom E-Liter 4K all have a extremely favorable matchup into Splatana Wiper Deco, applying long ranged pressure to the Wiper user and being able to splat it in one shot without the Wiper going near them. Splat Charger also has Splat Bomb, which can also be used for poking and chip damaging the Wiper.",
    "- Due to certain maps favoring Chargers due to a lack of flank routes, such as Mincemeat Metalworks, Scorch Gorge and Brinewater Springs. These maps further increased the negative matchup of Splatana Wiper Deco into Chargers.",
    "Long Ranged Splatlings such as Heavy Splatling, Heavy Splatling Deco, Hydra Splatling, Ballpoint Splatling, Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau and Heavy Edit Splatling all have similar matchups into Wiper Deco as the Long Ranged chargers, in addition to benefiting from the games map design.",
    "- All these splatlings have the ability to consistently paint the Wiper's feet, forcing it to move.",
    "- These splatlings also have a very quick time to splat and don't need to charge up to 100% to splat the user in one shot, unlike chargers.\nThis means that even while being flanked, the Splatling user can still easily splat the Wiper user, or worse, trade with them.",
    "Destroying the Wipers Squid Beakons is one of the best ways to deal with a Splatana Wiper Deco, as not only does it stop the Wiper from getting free jumps to key positions on the map. But it also prevents its teammates from jumping to them as well, forcing Wiper to make their way back through the map to replace the Squid Beakons.",
    "Spacing the Wiper out and not letting it get too close to the user is the best way with dealing with one, without its one shot splat attack, Wiper has a very slow 2-4 shot kill. Preventing it from getting close should be prioritized for all weapons, especially weapons that out range it as the Wiper needs to close the gap in order to deal damage to the user at all.",
    "Gear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon.",
    "These abilities are recommended to be run as primary abilities.",
    "Splatana Wiper Deco, like Splatana Wiper, can expect to be splatted a lot, especially if playing the weapon as a skirmisher. Even while playing as a support, the user can still expect to be splatted a lot. As such Comeback can be useful as when equipped it provided 10 AP of the following abilities for 20 seconds:",
    "- Ink Recovery Up",
    "- Ink Saver (Main)",
    "- Ink Saver (Sub)",
    "- Run Speed Up",
    "- Swim Speed Up",
    "- Special Charge Up",
    "Special Charge Up and Swim Speed up are especially useful, as the 10 AP of Swim Speed allows the user to reposition quicker and be more mobile during engagements and the 10 AP's worth of Special charge up reduces its points for special to 175p[2], allowing it to get off a set of missiles quickly after respawning.",
    "Last-Ditch Effort applies the following abilities incrementing between 1-18 AP when the enemy team counter is below 51, or the full 18 AP during the final 30 seconds of a match or during Overtime:",
    "Last-Ditch effort can increase the weapons ability to paint before needing to refill its ink tank. While Comeback is generally considered the better ability[3], Last-Ditch Effort still can provide utility to the weapon, especially for gear builds that are more support oriented.",
    "Super Jumping to a teammate carries the risk of being splatted, and destroyed Beakons still display a super jump marker when a player is jumping to it. Stealth Jump can minimize the chances of being splatted after landing.",
    "- Unlike Splatoon 1, Stealth Jump doesn't completely hide the users marker, only to players within 3 Inkblot Art Academy tiles worth of distance away from it[4]. So players are still recommended to use caution when super jumping into areas where enemy players are likely.\nBecause of this, if a short ranged weapon destroys the users Squid Beakon, it is very likely the user will be splatted. However Stealth Jump will protect the user if a weapon destroys the beakon from a distance.",
    "Quick Respawn shortens the users respawn time when being repeatedly splatted without getting any splats themselves. This allows the user to play aggressively even while being repeatedly splatted and works well with skirmisher weapons who typically get splatted repeatedly without splatting anybody.",
    "- Most popular builds run anywhere between 16-28 AP of Quick Respawn due to it needing to be run in large amounts to see any noticeable effects[5].\nIf running a Quick Respawn build, it is recommended not to run Special Charge Up as Quick Respawn builds want to play aggressively and get splatted a lot, while Special Charge Up Builds want to stay alive and use its special a lot.",
    "10 AP of Special Charge Up reduces Splatana Wiper Deco's Points for Special from a base of 190p to 175p[2], an additional main further reduces it to 164p[6]. A constant output of Tenta Missiles can easily swing the match in the user's favor and create holes in the enemy defense for them and their teammates to exploit.",
    "- A recommended load-out is Comeback paired with a main slot (10 AP) of Special Charge up.\nThis will give the user a consistent 175p Missiles throughout the entirety of the match[2], which will be further reduced to 164p for 20 seconds upon respawn[6]. In addition to all of the benefits provided by Comeback.",
    "Utility Subs are abilities that are only run as 1-2 sub-slots (3-6AP). Running more can be useful in niche situations but it is generally recommended to stick with 1-2 sub slots.",
    "Quick Super Jump is considered to be the best ability in the game[7]. All weapons benefit from one sub (3 AP) of Quick Super Jump, no matter their role.",
    "- One Sub saves 22 frames before leaving the ground (These are the frames that the user is vulnerable).\nTwo subs saves 30 frames before leaving the ground.[7]",
    "- Running Quick Super Jump allows the player to quickly get out of unfavourable matchups quickly and jump back in after respawning.",
    "Sub Power Up on Squid Beakon gives players the effects of Quick Super Jump to all players jumping to them.",
    "- One Sub of Sub Power Up gives users 4AP of Quick Super Jump when jumping to Beakons. This saves 25 frames before leaving the ground[8].\nTwo Subs of Sub Power Up gives users 9AP of Quick Super Jump when jumping to Beakons. This saves 35 Frames before leaving the ground[9].",
    "- This effect stacks with effects of Quick Super Jump.",
    "Ink Resistance Up is extremely useful for mobile weapons as they are guaranteed to touch enemy Ink. While Wiper Deco's charged slash provides enough paint to swim though, the user does typically touch enemy ink while doing so, especially when swimming through enemy controlled areas. Running Ink Resistance Up can help mitigate the damage from enemy ink and further increases its mobility in enemy ink.",
    "- One Sub of Ink Resistance Up\nDelays the damage taken from opposing ink by 10 frames.\nReduces the damage taken from 0.3 HP/f (health points per frame) to 0.2 HP/f.\nLowers the limit on the amount of damage opposing ink on surfaces can inflict from 40 HP to 38 HP.\nIncreases the normal running speed in opposing ink from 0.24 DU/f to 0.33 DU/f.[6]\nIncreases the jumping height in opposing ink from 0.8 to 0.854.",
    "- Two Subs of Ink Resistance Up\nDelays the damage taken from opposing ink by 15 frames.\nReduces the damage taken to 0.2 HP/f.\nLowers the damage limit of opposing ink to 36.2 HP.\nIncreases the normal running speed in opposing ink to 0.39 DU/f.\nIncreases the jumping height in opposing ink to 0.888.",
    "Sub Resistance Up is more of a niche utility sub, however it provides use for preventing common main weapon + sub weapon combos from splatting, like the Splash-o-matic or the S-BLAST '91",
    "- One Sub Prevents[10]:\nThe Combo of a Slosher direct hit plus a Splat Bomb 30 damage hit splatting in one hit\nFizzy Bomb from splatting the user using its indirect explosions.",
    "- Two Subs Prevents:\nTwo shots from Splattershot plus a Suction Bomb indirect from splatting[11].",
    "- Three Subs Prevents[12]:\nTwo Burst Bomb directs from splatting.\nSplatana Stamper's uncharged slash plus a Burst Bomb direct from splatting.\nS-BLAST '91's indirect hit and a Burst Bomb indirect from splatting.",
    "Running more than 3 subs can prevent other combos, however, it is extremely excessive and the maximum amount for Splatana Wiper Deco should be 3 subs.",
    "Swim Speed is an important stat for any weapon, as it allows the user to swim in and out of engagements faster, reposition faster and close the gap between it and its opponents faster. With a Skirmisher like Wiper, this is especially important, as it allows it to stay mobile.",
    "- Splatana Wiper as a main weapon is a lightweight weapon, this gives it a 5% Swim speed bonus (roughly 2 subs (6AP)) at all times.\nRunning an additional 1-2 subs gives it effectually 9-12AP of swim speed.",
    "Most frontline weapons, like Wiper, can be expected to be splatted during a match. One Sub saves 8.93% of the users special after being splatted[13].",
    "- An Additional Sub saves 14.61% of the users special[14].",
    "These abilities are not recommended for users to run on their builds, as they provide little to no benefit to the user, and in some cases are either outclassed or outright hampers Splatana Wiper Deco.",
    "Tenacity only works for backline weapons who typically remain alive while their teammates are splatted. Because Wiper is a frontline Skirmisher, it can expect to be splatted often. Comeback or Special Charge Up provide more use than Tenacity, and it is discouraged for players to run it.",
    "Respawn Punisher increases the user's respawn timer and increases the special gauge penalty. While his ability can be helpful for backline weapons that are typically not splatted at all during a match, for Splatana Wiper Deco this ability puts it at a disadvantage and is not recommended, due to how often it can expect to be splatted.",
    "Ability Doubler doubles sub abilities attached to it essentially meaning the shirt has 6 sub abilities instead of the typical three. However 3 Ability Slots * 6 AP per slot = 18 AP on ability doubler gear. However for regular gear (3 Ability Slots * 3 AP per slot) + (1 Main slot * 10 AP per slot) = 19 AP [15]. There is no reason to run this ability.",
    "Drop Roller is a worse Stealth Jump, as the users Jump marker is visible to all players and the user can easily be splatted by a well-timed bomb or a shot from a One-Hit splat weapon such as a Splat Roller or Splat Charger. Drop Roller only really benefits weapons that have a recall special such as Zipcaster and Inkjet. While one may argue that due to Wiper's fast charge time the Wiper could retaliate quickly, it isn't worth it in general, as Stealth Jump is still the better option.",
    "Run Speed Up doesn't affect the speed of Splatana's while attacking, similar to the Roller weapon class. It only effects its strafe speed while not attacking.",
    "Splatana Wiper Deco was revealed on May 24th, 2023 at 2:01 PM (UTC) on the Splatoon NA Twitter/ X account[16]. Being the first post launch weapon to be include with Tenta Missiles, the weapon received immediate backlash, with players saying it would ruin the meta. Upon release ProChara ranked it as the best new weapon in Sizzle Season[17]. As of Version 5.1, Wiper Deco is considered to be the best weapon with Tenta Missiles.",
    "Due to the current meta revolving around Tacticooler, Splatana Wiper, and Splatana Wiper Deco are considered to be upper mid teir weapons due to the effects of Tacticooler allowing weapons to play to similar levels of mobility, reducing their usefulness. In addition the decline of object specials such as Booyah Bomb and Crab Tank has also impacted its usage, due to Wiper/ Wiper Deco being picked for its Object Damage. Despite this the weapon sees consistent use and results, with it taking multiple SendouQ top 500 results[18], and it still remains a popular weapon."
