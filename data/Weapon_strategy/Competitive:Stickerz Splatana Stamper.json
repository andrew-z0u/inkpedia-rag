    "The Stickerz Splatana Stamper is a variant of the Splatana Stamper introduced in Version 10.0.0 of Splatoon 3.",
    "- Charged slashes have a high range and deal 70 damage, which can be followed up with a horizontal slash to splat an opponent. (Often called \"a bread and butter combo\")",
    "- Horizontal slashes are wider and travel faster, so they are more reliable to hit mobile opponents such as users of the Inkbrush or the Splatana Wiper.",
    "- The Autobomb sub weapon can be used to reveal sharking opponents and can be thrown to displace opposing anchors.",
    "- Autobombs are also particularly effective when thrown at slower weapons, such as an E-liter 4K or Dynamo Roller as it is slightly more difficult for them to move out of the way.",
    "- The Autobomb can be thrown onto the Tower, however it can easily bounce off the pole on the tower.",
    "- The Booyah Bomb often inks enough ground to capture a zone, although this is not guaranteed.\nIt can also be used to force opponents off the tower.",
    "- The Booyah Bomb can also be used to displace backlines or Anchors",
    "The Stickerz Splatana Stamper, being an aggressive front-line weapon, benefits greatly from this ability, providing it with some extra ink efficiency and mobility upon being splatted.",
    "Stealth Jump is an essential ability for any front-line weapon. When equipped, Stealth Jump better covers the super jump indicator from long distance opponents, allowing its user to more safely return to the front lines and maintain pressure on the opponent.",
    "The Stickerz Splatana Stamper's charged slashes consume a lot of ink. Running 2 subs provides an extra charged slash before running out of ink.",
    "As a slayer weapon, the Stickerz Splatana Stamper greatly benefits if it is able to swim faster. Swim Speed Up enables its user to more quickly close the distance towards an opponent, and generally benefits from greater mobility due to the end-lag of some of its attacks."
