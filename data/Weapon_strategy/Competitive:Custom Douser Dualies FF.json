  "content": "The Custom Douser Dualies FF is the alternative variant of the Douser Dualies FF, with a loadout of Burst Bomb and Triple Inkstrike. It has the longest range of any dualie, and compared to long-range shooters, it slightly outranges the Squeezer, but is just short of the Jet Squelcher. It can perform just one Dodge Roll at a time, and the distance rolled is further than other dualies. After rolling, the range is shorter, matching the range of the Mini Splatling, but the fire rate, shot velocity and accuracy increase drastically at the cost of high ink consumption. Because of these qualities, the Custom Douser Dualies FF finds itself positioned further back than most weapons, much like an anchor, but also flexes between a support and a slayer-type role.[1][2][3][4]\n\n- The Custom Douser Dualies FF's main strength is its range in its spread mode. In this mode, it can pressure opponents at range and provide long-range chip damage and turfing support for teammates. For these reasons, it is recommended to use most of the time. Its strafing speed in this mode is slightly slower than the Splattershot, having good mobility considering its range. At 25.5 damage per shot, they will need 4 shots to splat an opponent.[2][4]\nIn this mode, the weapon outranges a large amount of weapons in the game, which can be used to the player's advantage. It is advised to stay in its most effective range, as its fall-off damage is poor.[2]\nStaying back and playing to the strengths of your range is safer and less punishing than executing a Dodge Roll. This same philosophy applies to other long-ranged weapons in the game.\n\n- In this mode, the weapon outranges a large amount of weapons in the game, which can be used to the player's advantage.

This same philosophy applies to other long-ranged weapons in the game.\n\n- As it only has one Dodge Roll, this leaves little room for error. In general, its Dodge Rolls should be used sparingly and more strategically compared to the other dualies. The weapon's turret mode can be used for confirming close quarters splats, or as a defensive measure in response to being rushed down.[2]\nThe long Dodge Roll distance of the weapon can be used to pursue and splat fleeing opponents.[5]\nAlthough the range in turret mode is shorter, the range in this mode outranges a number of short-ranged weapons.[5]\n\n- The long Dodge Roll distance of the weapon can be used to pursue and splat fleeing opponents.[5]\n\n- Although the range in turret mode is shorter, the range in this mode outranges a number of short-ranged weapons.[5]\n\n- Burst Bombs are an important part of the weapon's kit, being able to help with the weapon's damage. The main weapon is able to splat an opponent in two shots after a direct hit, or three with an indirect. It can improve its matchups against certain weapons such as Range Blasters by limiting their movement.[6]\nThey can also help the weapon in being more consistent with hitting its shots, and is able to be positioned much more aggressively as a result.[7]\n\n- They can also help the weapon in being more consistent with hitting its shots, and is able to be positioned much more aggressively as a result.[7]\n\n- In this mode, the weapon outranges a large amount of weapons in the game, which can be used to the player's advantage.

It is able to reach the enemy's snipe area from the middle of the stage, and is able to fire at enemies safely from the amount of high ground in the spawn areas. There are several spots to utilize the weapon's long Dodge Roll to catch opponents off guard, particularly around the pillar structures.\n\n- On Crableg Capital, the weapon can take advantage of the various uninkable grates as a movement option with its use of Run Speed Up.\n\n- Barnacle & Dime has several areas the weapon can take advantage of, with some flat and open terrain in the middle and upper sides of the stage, as well as more enclosed, sloped areas which suit the weapon's Dodge Roll.\n\n- Undertow Spillway favors the weapon's long range, featuring long and narrow routes.

This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.\n\nThe Custom Douser Dualies FF runs many of the same abilities as its original variant, but it tends to have less gear freedom. The weapon also notably runs more ink efficiency abilities, mainly to mitigate the ink consumption from throwing Burst Bombs. This also helps with builds that use Last-Ditch Effort, as there will sometimes be games where the ability does not activate.[12]\n\nSince the weapon mainly uses its spread mode, Run Speed Up will improve its strafing speed, while also helping it to paint more effectively. 1 main, or at the very least 2 subs of Run Speed Up are recommended.[1][12]\n\nThis ability works somewhat well on the weapon to improve its jump accuracy, as they can utilize dualie hopping. 1 sub is recommended.[12]\n\nWhile the weapon plays further back than most weapons, Stealth Jump is one of the best abilities in the game.[12]\n\nOne sub of each ability are recommended as utility subs. Special Saver is considered mandatory on the weapon due to the lack of Special Charge Up.[12]\n\nAs with the original variant, the various abilities this ability provides are extremely beneficial. This ability is recommended to use on Clam Blitz, and can be used on Tower Control and Rainmaker.[12]\n\nWhen this ability is active, ink efficiency is greatly improved, allowing Burst Bombs to be used more comfortably. This ability is recommended to use on Splat Zones. This ability can also be used on some stages on Tower Control and Rainmaker that tend to snowball.[12]\n\nThis ability improves the weapons general ink efficiency, but especially after using a Burst Bomb. This allows the weapon to fire for longer after throwing a Burst Bomb compared to if it was running Ink Saver (Sub). 2 subs are recommended.[12]\n\nAllows the weapon to have less downtime after throwing a Burst Bomb. 1 sub is recommended.[12]\n\nThis ability increases the throwing range of the Burst Bomb. With 2 subs, the throwing range will closely match the range of the weapon.[12]\n\nSince the weapon's ink efficiency was improved in Version 8.1.0, this has given the weapon the opportunity for more gear freedom. As a result, some builds may substitute Ink Saver (Main) with Swim Speed Up.\n\nTo be added."
