  "content": "The Heavy Splatling Remix shares the similar strengths as its vanilla variant, but instead offers a kit that allows the user to play more supportive, spreading turf and being able to spam Booyah Bombs more efficiently than other weapons such as the Aerospray PG.\n\nThe Heavy Splatling Remix is a long ranged anchor's weapon, similar to chargers, albeit not as long ranged:\n\n- Like most chargers, the Heavy Splatling Remix needs to charge before it can fire:\nWhen barely charged, its effective range is only 84 units — shorter than that of a Splattershot. Finishing the first full level of charge will increase the range to its maximum of 168 units.\nCharging takes 50 frames (about 0.83 seconds) to reach the first full level and an additional 25 frames (about 0.42 seconds) to reach the second level.\nDue to both the long charging time and the reduced range when not fully charged, the Heavy Splatling Remix is vulnerable to attack from shorter ranged weapons while charging, so it is generally advised to remain out of sight from the opponent (e.g. behind an obstacle) and not too close to opposing ink while charging.[2]\nPartly charging a Heavy Splatling Remix will reduce its effective range but also allow it to fire more quickly – especially in a tight situation.[3]\n\n- When barely charged, its effective range is only 84 units — shorter than that of a Splattershot.

Therefore, a Heavy Splatling Remix user should lead their shots to hit their targets.\n\n- While the Heavy Splatling Remix's firepower is devastating up close, it is still recommended to keep shorter ranged opponents from getting too close, where their fast shot velocity and high DPS will allow them to either trade or win a confrontation outright.\n\n- Despite its long range, the Heavy Splatling Remix has a slower initial shot velocity (21 units per frame) than do some other weapons, such as the Jet Squelcher (33.6 units per frame) and the Splat Charger (48 units per frame). Therefore, a Heavy Splatling Remix user should lead their shots to hit their targets.\n\n- The Heavy Splatling Remix's high firing rate and excellent ink coverage give it an advantage over chargers and the Jet Squelcher in terms of turfing:\nCombined with its long range, the Heavy Splatling Remix can either gain or maintain map control and capture or hold zones in Splat Zones from a relatively safe distance while simultaneously watching for any flanking opponents.\nIt also makes a great complement to poorly turfing weapons, such as a Splattershot Pro or a blaster, providing both support fire and turfing.\n\n- Combined with its long range, the Heavy Splatling Remix can either gain or maintain map control and capture or hold zones in Splat Zones from a relatively safe distance while simultaneously watching for any flanking opponents.\n\n- It also makes a great complement to poorly turfing weapons, such as a Splattershot Pro or a blaster, providing both support fire and turfing.\n\n- Due to the time spent charging and firing their weapon, a Heavy Splatling Remix user spends a larger proportion of their time in humanoid form than do users of most other weapon classes.\nWhile a Heavy Splatling Remix user has decent running speed (0.7 units per frame while firing, 0.62 units per frame while charging) compared to users of other weapons (e.g. Jet Squelcher at 0.6 units per frame while firing), its time spent running instead of swimming makes it comparably slower and more vulnerable to attack, especially from opposing chargers.\nBoth Run Speed Up and Ink Resistance Up can improve the mobility during charging and firing, particularly while strafing.[4]\n\n- While a Heavy Splatling Remix user has decent running speed (0.7 units per frame while firing, 0.62 units per frame while charging) compared to users of other weapons (e.g. Jet Squelcher at 0.6 units per frame while firing), its time spent running instead of swimming makes it comparably slower and more vulnerable to attack, especially from opposing chargers.\n\n- Both Run Speed Up and Ink Resistance Up can improve the mobility during charging and firing, particularly while strafing.[4]\n\n- Weapons that outrange the Heavy Splatling Remix (e.g. most chargers and the Ballpoint Splatling) are its most difficult matchups since it has neither the range nor the mobility to challenge them. Remain out of range from these weapons and instead focus on helping teammates splat other opponents, allowing your teammates to challenge the long-ranged opponents.\n\n- When barely charged, its effective range is only 84 units — shorter than that of a Splattershot. Finishing the first full level of charge will increase the range to its maximum of 168 units.\n\n- Charging takes 50 frames (about 0.83 seconds) to reach the first full level and an additional 25 frames (about 0.42 seconds) to reach the second level.\n\n- Due to both the long charging time and the reduced range when not fully charged, the Heavy Splatling Remix is vulnerable to attack from shorter ranged weapons while charging, so it is generally advised to remain out of sight from the opponent (e.g. behind an obstacle) and not too close to opposing ink while charging.[2]\n\n- Partly charging a Heavy Splatling Remix will reduce its effective range but also allow it to fire more quickly – especially in a tight situation.[3]\n\n- While the Heavy Splatling Remix's firepower is devastating up close, it is still recommended to keep shorter ranged opponents from getting too close, where their fast shot velocity and high DPS will allow them to either trade or win a confrontation outright.\n\n- Despite its long range, the Heavy Splatling Remix has a slower initial shot velocity (21 units per frame) than do some other weapons, such as the Jet Squelcher (33.6 units per frame) and the Splat Charger (48 units per frame).

Coordinating with teammates and their specials, such as Bomb Launcher and Baller, can better ensure capturing a zone.\n\n- Often, a Booyah Bomb will not be enough to fully capture a zone. Coordinating with teammates and their specials, such as Bomb Launcher and Baller, can better ensure capturing a zone.\n\n- When deployed, the Booyah Bomb is capable of protecting oneself and one's teammates from attacks - including bombs - and clearing an area of opponents, whether forcing them to flee or splatting them outright.\nBecause the Booyah Bomb can nullify an opponent's bombs, it serves as a great counter to an opponent's Bomb Launcher, particularly when maintaining control over a zone.\nWhen aimed at the Tower in Tower Control, the Booyah Bomb covers a large area around its point of detonation for a brief amount of time, as opposed to the Sting Ray, which fires a narrow line for a more sustained period. There are situations where a Booyah Bomb is preferable over a Sting Ray in stopping or slowing down the Tower and other situations where a Sting Ray is more effective.\n\n- Because the Booyah Bomb can nullify an opponent's bombs, it serves as a great counter to an opponent's Bomb Launcher, particularly when maintaining control over a zone.\n\n- When aimed at the Tower in Tower Control, the Booyah Bomb covers a large area around its point of detonation for a brief amount of time, as opposed to the Sting Ray, which fires a narrow line for a more sustained period.

There are situations where a Booyah Bomb is preferable over a Sting Ray in stopping or slowing down the Tower and other situations where a Sting Ray is more effective.\n\nThe Heavy Splatling Remix has great range and powerful damage but is lacks mobility while moving or firing and has trouble leading pushes and pursuing opponents. Be sure to include some mobile, shorter-ranged weapons in the team composition. Otherwise, a team with too many longer-ranged weapons will have major drawbacks:[5]\n\n- The lack of mobility will make it difficult for such a team to mount a push.\n\n- The reduced ability to battle in close range will make the team vulnerable to a well-timed flank or a well-positioned shark.\n\nPoint Sensors lack certain advantages offered by lethal bombs — particularly either Splat or Suction Bombs, which provide their user's team a couple advantages over another team that has no lethal bombs in its composition:[5]\n\n- Their one-hit-splat offers its user's team chances of instantly gaining a numbers advantage, from which a game-winning push can arise.\n\n- Their lethal explosion provides space for its user's team to either push into an area held by the opponent or stall an opponent's push.\n\nThe Booyah Bomb is a unique special weapon that enables its user's teammates to directly assist in powering it up. However, some considerations need to be taken regarding this trait:\n\n- If you are advanced into the opponents' territory or are either flanking or sharking, refrain from charging a teammate's Booyah Bomb to avoid exposing your position to the opponent.\n\n- It is also generally advised to refrain from charging a teammate's Booyah Bomb while in the middle of a confrontation with an opponent.\n\n- Users of other anchor's weapons each have to confront a Heavy Splatling Remix differently:\nMost chargers and some splatlings (i.e. the Ballpoint Splatling and Hydra Splatling) outrange the Heavy Splatling Remix user and can simply zone them out.\nThe Custom Jet Squelcher has an equal effective range (168 units) and better mobility but less firepower than the Heavy Splatling Remix, so outmaneuvering it is more effective than a direct approach.\nThe heavyweight Explosher is less mobile and far slower firing than the Heavy Splatling Remix and would also lose a direct encounter. Use the terrain and any obstacles to provide cover while lobbing accurate shots to cover the area around the opponent in ink to demobilize them.\n\n- Most chargers and some splatlings (i.e. the Ballpoint Splatling and Hydra Splatling) outrange the Heavy Splatling Remix user and can simply zone them out.\n\n- The Custom Jet Squelcher has an equal effective range (168 units) and better mobility but less firepower than the Heavy Splatling Remix, so outmaneuvering it is more effective than a direct approach.\n\n- The heavyweight Explosher is less mobile and far slower firing than the Heavy Splatling Remix and would also lose a direct encounter. Use the terrain and any obstacles to provide cover while lobbing accurate shots to cover the area around the opponent in ink to demobilize them.\n\n- Unless a Heavy Splatling Remix user is caught without a charge, approaching one directly with a shorter ranged weapon usually leads to a one-way trip back to the spawn point. Rely on flanking or sharking to get within range of an opponent wielding a Heavy Splatling Remix.\n\n- When tagged with an opponent's Point Sensor, either briefly keep a distance from opponents to avoid getting splatted or lure the opponents away from the objective or an important area of the stage, allowing teammates to reclaim turf, push the objective, or ambush opponents.\n\n- Regularly watch the HUD to know when an opposing Heavy Splatling Remix's Booyah Bomb is fully charged, and both watch and listen for when it is activated.\nIf an opponent activates a Booyah Bomb in an unsafe position, planting a Suction Bomb or other lethal bomb below them will force them to stay in the air longer as well as weaken their armor when it explodes, giving you the extra time and damage needed to break the armor with your main weapon.\nTenta Missiles can splat a Booyah Bomb user in three direct hits.\nIf using Tenta Missiles to cancel an opponent's Booyah Bomb, targeting them with five missiles is most efficient.\nA Splashdown within range can severely damage Booyah Bomb armor if not destroy it outright.\nSplash Damage by two Bubbles with Object Shredder will destroy the Booyah Bomb's shield.\nWhile an opponent charges a Booyah Bomb, any of their teammates who help in powering up the special might expose their positions.\n\n- If an opponent activates a Booyah Bomb in an unsafe position, planting a Suction Bomb or other lethal bomb below them will force them to stay in the air longer as well as weaken their armor when it explodes, giving you the extra time and damage needed to break the armor with your main weapon.\n\n- Tenta Missiles can splat a Booyah Bomb user in three direct hits.\nIf using Tenta Missiles to cancel an opponent's Booyah Bomb, targeting them with five missiles is most efficient.\n\n- If using Tenta Missiles to cancel an opponent's Booyah Bomb, targeting them with five missiles is most efficient.\n\n- A Splashdown within range can severely damage Booyah Bomb armor if not destroy it outright.\n\n- Splash Damage by two Bubbles with Object Shredder will destroy the Booyah Bomb's shield.\n\n- While an opponent charges a Booyah Bomb, any of their teammates who help in powering up the special might expose their positions.\n\n- Most chargers and some splatlings (i.e. the Ballpoint Splatling and Hydra Splatling) outrange the Heavy Splatling Remix user and can simply zone them out.\n\n- The Custom Jet Squelcher has an equal effective range (168 units) and better mobility but less firepower than the Heavy Splatling Remix, so outmaneuvering it is more effective than a direct approach.\n\n- The heavyweight Explosher is less mobile and far slower firing than the Heavy Splatling Remix and would also lose a direct encounter.

This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.\n\nEver since its introduction in version 4.3.0, Bomb Defense Up DX will not only reduce the damage taken from opposing sub and special weapons that are not one-hit-splat but will also reduce the duration of the tracking effects of certain opponent's sub and special weapons, such as Point Sensors and Ink Mines, allowing the user of this ability to evade detection more easily. Since the Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau is prone to being attacked by bombs and Tenta Missiles due to it being an anchor, having this ability is great for improving its survivability - especially considering how slow it is in its second mode. Just three ability points, or one sub, offer plenty of utility:[6][7]\n\n- The splash damage of most bombs is reduced from 30 HP to 28.6 HP. This reduction in damage provides two benefits:\nIt prevents its user from being exposed on their opponents' map by the splash damage of most single bombs.\nInk Armor will not break due to splash damage from a single bomb whose splash damage normally inflicts 30 HP of damage.\n\n- It prevents its user from being exposed on their opponents' map by the splash damage of most single bombs.\n\n- Ink Armor will not break due to splash damage from a single bomb whose splash damage normally inflicts 30 HP of damage.\n\n- The splash damage of near-misses from either Tenta Missiles or Inkjet, the minimum splash damage of bubbles, and the collision damage from Baller are all reduced from 50 HP to 48.3 HP, enabling one to survive two hits from any of these specific means of special weapon damage.\n\n- It prevents its user from being exposed on their opponents' map by the splash damage of most single bombs.\n\n- Ink Armor will not break due to splash damage from a single bomb whose splash damage normally inflicts 30 HP of damage.\n\nA Heavy Splatling Remix user can expect to come in contact with the opponent's ink on various surfaces, which can both be damaging and reduce mobility. Ink Resistance Up not only partially offsets the reduction in mobility but also delays the damage taken from contact with opposing ink.\n\n- Just three ability points, or one sub,…\n…delays the damage taken from opposing ink by 10 frames.\n…reduces the damage taken from 0.3 HP/f (health points per frame) to 0.2 HP/f.\n…lowers the limit on the amount of damage opposing ink on surfaces can inflict from 40 HP to 38 HP.\n…increases the normal running speed in opposing ink from 0.24 DU/f to 0.33 DU/f.[8]\n…increases the jumping height in opposing ink from 0.8 to 0.854.\n\n- …delays the damage taken from opposing ink by 10 frames.\n\n- …reduces the damage taken from 0.3 HP/f (health points per frame) to 0.2 HP/f.\n\n- …lowers the limit on the amount of damage opposing ink on surfaces can inflict from 40 HP to 38 HP.\n\n- …increases the normal running speed in opposing ink from 0.24 DU/f to 0.33 DU/f.[8]\n\n- …increases the jumping height in opposing ink from 0.8 to 0.854.\n\n- Six ability points, or two subs,…\n…delays the damage taken from opposing ink by 15 frames.\n…reduces the damage taken to 0.2 HP/f.\n…lowers the damage limit of opposing ink to 36.2 HP.\n…increases the normal running speed in opposing ink to 0.39 DU/f.\n…increases the jumping height in opposing ink to 0.888.\n\n- …delays the damage taken from opposing ink by 15 frames.\n\n- …reduces the damage taken to 0.2 HP/f.\n\n- …lowers the damage limit of opposing ink to 36.2 HP.\n\n- …increases the normal running speed in opposing ink to 0.39 DU/f.\n\n- …increases the jumping height in opposing ink to 0.888.\n\n- …delays the damage taken from opposing ink by 10 frames.\n\n- …reduces the damage taken from 0.3 HP/f (health points per frame) to 0.2 HP/f.\n\n- …lowers the limit on the amount of damage opposing ink on surfaces can inflict from 40 HP to 38 HP.\n\n- …increases the normal running speed in opposing ink from 0.24 DU/f to 0.33 DU/f.[8]\n\n- …increases the jumping height in opposing ink from 0.8 to 0.854.\n\n- …delays the damage taken from opposing ink by 15 frames.\n\n- …reduces the damage taken to 0.2 HP/f.\n\n- …lowers the damage limit of opposing ink to 36.2 HP.\n\n- …increases the normal running speed in opposing ink to 0.39 DU/f.\n\n- …increases the jumping height in opposing ink to 0.888.\n\nAn ability exclusive to shoes, Object Shredder provides a Heavy Splatling Remix user three specific benefits:\n\n- It increases their damage dealt to bubbles – both friendly and opposing – by 30%, allowing for quicker growing and popping of bubbles.\n\n- It triples the amount of damage inflicted onto armored opponents, allowing a Heavy Splatling Remix to break an opponent's Ink Armor in one hit. Falloff damage can often occur due to the weapon's long range, which can prevent Ink Armor from being broken easily as the weapon does 30 damage.\n\n- It enables them to pop the Rainmaker shield more quickly with their main weapon, allowing their team to start or restart a push more quickly while gaining a large amount of turf control in the immediate area.\n\nThe Heavy Splatling Remix benefits most from the second buff, allowing it to consistently break Ink Armor in one hit.\n\nQuick Super Jump decreases both the \"charge\" time before and the travel time of a Super Jump, allowing its user to escape more quickly. A Heavy Splatling Remix user is usually vulnerable in close quarters and would also have an incentive to maintain valuable special gauge progress for their Booyah Bomb.\n\n- Six ability points, or two subs, of Quick Super Jump decreases the \"charge\" time by 30 frames, or 0.5 seconds.\n\nBecause a Heavy Splatling Remix user spends comparatively more time in humanoid form charging and firing their weapon, they can be easier targets for opponents to splat. Run Speed Up increases the running speed of a Heavy Splatling Remix user, including while charging and firing.\n\n- 15 ability points – either five subs or about one main and two subs – are enough to increase run speed while firing above 0.8 units per frame; 23 ability points – two mains and one sub – increase it above 0.85 units per frame.\n\n- 13 ability points – one main and one sub – are enough to increase run speed while charging above 0.7 units per frame; 23 ability points increase it above 0.75 units per frame.[9]\n\nSpecial Charge Up accelerates building up the special gauge for Booyah Bomb, which can prove invaluable for either capturing or holding the zone or either stopping or slowing the Tower.\n\n- 13 ability points – one main and one sub – effectively reduce the special gauge requirement to just above 170p.\n\nSwim Speed Up increases swim speed. Because a Heavy Splatling Remix user has a hard time splatting flankers, Swim Speed Up can help escape the situation and get to a safe spot to Super Jump away.\n\n[10][11]"
