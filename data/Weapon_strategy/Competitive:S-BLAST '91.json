  "content": "The S-BLAST '91 is a mid-range blaster with high splatting potential whose main strength is having two distinct firing modes with very different characteristics.\n\nThe main advantage of the S-BLAST '91 is its ability to switch range values, dealing with both up-close opponents and far off ones.\n\n- The default mode of this weapon is its long range mode, with a faster shot velocity and very small blast radius.\nThis mode should be used to focus on directs on longer ranged opponents. The blast radius gives very little room for error if the shot misses.\nThe faster shot velocity makes it slightly easier to hit directs as well, but it is still important to lead shots to hit directs\nThe long range mode can still be used with a jump. Pressing ZR before jumping will keep the long range mode while also maintaining perfect accuracy, making directs very reliable with good aim.\n\n- This mode should be used to focus on directs on longer ranged opponents.

Pressing ZR before jumping will keep the long range mode while also maintaining perfect accuracy, making directs very reliable with good aim.\n\n- After jumping, the S-BLAST '91 enters its short range mode, with a much larger blast radius at the cost of range.\nThis is the main mode that should be used when fighting with opponents. It's large blast radius makes it much easier to hit opponents with high damage.\nWith a large blast radius, it is important to remember that directs can still splat an opponent in one hit, making it significantly quicker to splat.\nWhen near teammates, the consistent damage of at least 50 is helpful to assist with many different weapons such as Slosher, Snipewriter 5H and potentially other bombs\n\n- This is the main mode that should be used when fighting with opponents.

Opponent's can sometimes escape getting splatted if the user misses a shot.\nThe kill time of the weapon is very slow without directs. Even with Burst Bombs, opponents can force a trade if they have a weapon with a quicker kill time.\nThe S'BLAST '91's turfing and ink efficiency with Burst Bombs are both rather poor. These two combined can make an S-BLAST '91 user cornered quickly by enemy ink.\n\n- The long range mode's blast radius is very small, even smaller than every other blaster in the game.

These two combined can make an S-BLAST '91 user cornered quickly by enemy ink.\n\nThe instant explosion ink consumption of Burst Bombs offer a S-BLAST 91 user plenty of uses:\n\n- Their quick damage makes them suitable for leading off attacks or finishing off injured opponents who attempt to flee. The S-BLAST '91 is one of a few weapons that can perform a combo with Burst Bombs, alleviating its problem of a slow kill time slightly.\n\n- They instantly turf inkable surfaces, permitting either a fast pursuit of an opponent or a rapid retreat from an unfavorable situation.\n\n- Opponents hit by Burst Bombs will be surrounded by your team's ink, further limiting their health and mobility.\n\n- Direct hits will inflict 60 HP of damage, while splash damage will only deliver 25-35 HP. Always go for direct hits whenever possible.\nThe S-BLAST '91 is very inconsistent with the 25-35 damage from Burst Bombs as sometimes the weapon will deal under 65 damage and may not be enough to splat. Be wary of the ink tank and the opponent's health before committing to a Burst Bomb.\n\n- The S-BLAST '91 is very inconsistent with the 25-35 damage from Burst Bombs as sometimes the weapon will deal under 65 damage and may not be enough to splat. Be wary of the ink tank and the opponent's health before committing to a Burst Bomb.\n\n- An opponent's Triple Splashdown, Booyah Bomb or Triple Inkstrike will defuse any Burst Bombs it comes in contact with, so hold off throwing them until after the special weapon finishes.\n\n- Using any special weapon also provides a free ink tank refill. Therefore, a S-BLAST '91 user can throw Burst Bombs before and after activating Booyah Bomb.\n\n- Be sure to assist teammates with Burst Bombs if possible. The damage and paint can easily turn the tide of a fight or further guarantee a splat.\n\n- While it is possible to throw two burst bombs on a full ink tank, it is advised to avoid this as a S-BLAST '91 user, especially in a fight. Throwing two will usually leave the user with enough for one or even no shots afterward, making it really easy to be rushed down.\n\n- The S-BLAST '91 is very inconsistent with the 25-35 damage from Burst Bombs as sometimes the weapon will deal under 65 damage and may not be enough to splat. Be wary of the ink tank and the opponent's health before committing to a Burst Bomb.\n\nThe Booyah Bomb can either turn the tide of a battle or fully tilt it in its user's team's favor, but only if used properly.\n\n- In general, activate the Booyah Bomb in a relatively safe place, as even an opposing Aerospray user within range can break the Booyah Bomb armor.\n\n- The Booyah Bomb can force opponents – particularly anchors – to move out of position or delay an opponent's offensive push.\n\n- The explosion of the Booyah Bomb often places enough ink to uncap most Splat Zones and single-handedly capture some smaller Splat Zones.\nSometimes, a Booyah Bomb cannot fully capture or uncap a zone. There may also be two separate Splat Zones. Coordinating with teammates and their specials, such as Triple Inkstrike and Tenta Missiles, can better ensure capturing a zone or two.\n\n- Sometimes, a Booyah Bomb cannot fully capture or uncap a zone. There may also be two separate Splat Zones. Coordinating with teammates and their specials, such as Triple Inkstrike and Tenta Missiles, can better ensure capturing a zone or two.\n\n- When deployed, the Booyah Bomb is capable of protecting oneself and one's teammates from attacks - including bombs - and clearing an area of opponents, whether forcing them to flee or splatting them outright.\nWhen aimed at the Tower in Tower Control, a Booyah Bomb covers a large area around its point of detonation for a brief amount of time, as opposed to a Triple Inkstrike, which covers multiple areas for a shorter period, or a Killer Wail 5.1, which fires in narrow lines and will follow opponents as they leave the tower.\n\n- When aimed at the Tower in Tower Control, a Booyah Bomb covers a large area around its point of detonation for a brief amount of time, as opposed to a Triple Inkstrike, which covers multiple areas for a shorter period, or a Killer Wail 5.1, which fires in narrow lines and will follow opponents as they leave the tower.\n\n- Since special weapons are also free ink tank refills, a S-BLAST '91 user can use its Booyah Bomb to stay alive and throw Burst Bombs after throwing the Booyah Bomb, keeping up the pressure for a longer amount of time\n\n- Sometimes, a Booyah Bomb cannot fully capture or uncap a zone.

Not having enough turfing ability – usually from having too many blasters and chargers – presents its own set of problems:[1]\n\n- A team whose composition lacks enough turfing ability can be rendered immobile if the other team dominates map control.\n\n- A lack of turfing also makes it difficult to alter the course of a game, even after wiping out the other team.\n\nThe Booyah Bomb is a unique special weapon that enables its user's teammates to directly assist in powering it up. However, some considerations need to be taken regarding this trait:\n\n- If you are advanced into the opponents' territory or are either flanking or sharking, refrain from charging a teammate's Booyah Bomb to avoid exposing your position to the opponent.\n\n- It is also generally advised to refrain from charging a teammate's Booyah Bomb while in the middle of a confrontation with an opponent.\n\n- Weapons with faster kill times, such as the Splattershot, and Splash-o-matic can splat an opposing S-BLAST '91 user before it can fire the second shot. Be wary of the direct however.\n\n- More midranged weapons with a way to output pressure, such as the Range Blaster or Splatana Stamper can prevent a S-BLAST '91 user from getting within range. The long range shot can sometimes reach so be careful.\n\n- Longer ranged weapons can easily force an opposing S-BLAST '91 user out of place if it doesn't get too close.\n\n- The weapon suffers from high ink consumption of 8.5% per shot, especially when using Burst Bombs. Long confrontation might make the opponent weary and low on ink for taking the upper hand.\n\n- A S-BLAST '91 user will likely go for both flanking and sharking to maximize the use of their weapon:\nKeep track of all four members of the opposing team – which ones are present, which ones are splatted, and which ones are back at their spawn point.\nCheck the map periodically for opposing ink forming around flanks to anticipate a flanking attack.\nTo prevent sharking, check suspicious puddles of the opponents' ink, preferably with a thrown sub weapon.\nWeapons that track opponents, such as Point Sensors, temporarily prevent an opponent from sharking and makes them an easier target for long-ranged teammates to pick off.\n\n- Keep track of all four members of the opposing team – which ones are present, which ones are splatted, and which ones are back at their spawn point.\n\n- Check the map periodically for opposing ink forming around flanks to anticipate a flanking attack.\n\n- To prevent sharking, check suspicious puddles of the opponents' ink, preferably with a thrown sub weapon.\n\n- Weapons that track opponents, such as Point Sensors, temporarily prevent an opponent from sharking and makes them an easier target for long-ranged teammates to pick off.\n\n- Keep track of all four members of the opposing team – which ones are present, which ones are splatted, and which ones are back at their spawn point.\n\n- Check the map periodically for opposing ink forming around flanks to anticipate a flanking attack.\n\n- To prevent sharking, check suspicious puddles of the opponents' ink, preferably with a thrown sub weapon.\n\n- Weapons that track opponents, such as Point Sensors, temporarily prevent an opponent from sharking and makes them an easier target for long-ranged teammates to pick off.\n\n- Regularly watch the HUD to know when the opposing S-BLAST '91 user's Booyah Bomb is fully charged, and both watch and listen for when it is activated.\nIf they activate a Booyah Bomb in an unsafe position, try attacking them, particularly with bombs and chargers.\nWhenever an opposing S-BLAST '91 user charges a Booyah Bomb, any of their teammates – whether active or splatted – who help in powering up the special might expose their positions. Use this opportunity to locate, call out, and – if possible – splat any active opponents who are powering up their teammate's Booyah Bomb.\nA Booyah Bomb turfs surfaces starting from the center before spreading out. If your weapon has the range to maintain a safe distance from the explosion of an opponent's Booyah Bomb, it is possible to maintain possession of a Splat Zone by turfing the center of where the Bomb landed.\nThe S-BLAST '91 user might go for risky plays as they know they have the Booyah Bomb ready as a safety net. It is possible to bait them to take control of an open space and surprise them with a teammate to force out a Booyah Bomb, shoot it with a teammate, and cancel it.\n\n- If they activate a Booyah Bomb in an unsafe position, try attacking them, particularly with bombs and chargers.\n\n- Whenever an opposing S-BLAST '91 user charges a Booyah Bomb, any of their teammates – whether active or splatted – who help in powering up the special might expose their positions.

This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.\n\nUnless a S-BLAST '91 user is on an extended splatting streak, they can expect to get splatted often. When equipped, Comeback grants 10 ability points of six different stackable abilities for twenty seconds after respawning from getting splatted by an opponent:\n\n- Ink Recovery Up\n\n- Ink Saver (Main)\n\n- Ink Saver (Sub)\n\n- Run Speed Up\n\n- Swim Speed Up\n\n- Special Charge Up\n\nAll of these abilities (Except Run Speed Up) benefit a S-BLAST '91, allowing them to throw Burst Bombs more often, get more Booyah Bombs, and more quickly pursue and pressure the opponent upon returning from spawn.\n\nWhen on the front lines, any S-BLAST '91 user is bound to come into contact with enemy ink on various surfaces. which can both be damaging and reduce mobility. Ink Resistance Up not only partially offsets the reduction in mobility but also delays the damage taken from contact with opposing ink.\n\nWith its high ink consumption, an S-BLAST '91 user often has trouble when using Burst Bombs in fights. Ink Saver (Sub) can help the user retain more of their ink tank when using Burst Bombs, allowing them to fight without running out of ink more often or poke more at enemies.\n\nWhile the long range mode will not have its shots deviate, the short range mode can sometimes miss an opponent due to the shot deviation. Sometimes a direct is needed in order to splat an opponent with a faster kill time. Intensify Action can reduce this shot deviation and make it more reliable to hit directs with the short range mode. Similarly to the Luna Blaster, the S-BLAST '91 has a stronger Intensify Action effect than other blasters so a few subs will have a stronger effect.\n\nQuick Respawn shortens respawn time after getting splatted (under specific conditions), encouraging a S-BLAST '91 user to remain aggressive even after getting splatted.\n\n- 16 ability points – one main and two subs – are enough to reduce the respawn time from 8.5 seconds to 6.67 seconds.\n\n- 26 ability points – two mains and two subs – is enough to reduce the respawn time from 8.5 seconds to 5.8 seconds.[2]\n\nQuick Super Jump decreases the \"charge\" time before a Super Jump. All weapons benefit from this ability since Quick Super Jump allows them to both return to the front lines more quickly and escape unfavorable situations more easily to preserve special gauge progress.\n\n- One sub, or 3 ability points, of Quick Super Jump decreases the \"charge\" time by 22 frames, or 0.36 seconds.\n\nWhile fighting often, an S-BLAST '91 user is expected to die often and will lose charge in its special gauge. Special Saver can help reduce that penalty and get more Booyah Bombs, allowing for more displacement or survivability.\n\nSuper Jumping to a teammate after respawning carries the risk of getting splatted upon landing, due to the presence of a Super Jump indicator. When equipped, Stealth Jump better covers this indicator from long distance opponents, allowing its user to more safely return to the front lines and maintain pressure on the opponent.\n\nSwim Speed Up can help close the distance towards an opponent, more quickly respond to an opponents' push, or escape unfavorable situations.\n\nWhile initially drawing much attention and excitement upon its reveal in the Chill Season 2023 trailer for having a Burst Bomb, the weapon ended up seeing little competitive use until 9.2.0. ProChara, who previously used the S-BLAST '92 competitively, had dropped the weapon by this time.\n\nIn the coming patches, the weapon would receive buffs to its long range blast radius and fire rate in 7.2.0 and 8.1.0 respectively. Range Blaster, the dominant blaster at the time, would also receive a nerf in 9.0.0 that decreased its blast radius and painting. Squeezer was also nerfed in the same patch, which was a matchup that S-BLAST struggled with.[3] Finally, a buff to Booyah Bomb in 9.2.0 would push the weapon into relevancy.\n\nThe weapon notably won Area Cup, a prominent Japanese Splat Zones-only tournament on February 1st, 2025.[4] Some players consider S-BLAST '91 to be better than Range Blaster currently,[5] and players such as Grey, Lucyfer, and Len are pushing S-BLAST '91 competitively."
