  "content": "The E-Liter 4K Scope's range and pressure best suit it for the Anchor role:\n\n- Being a charger, the E-Liter 4K Scope needs to charge to get the maximum range and damage, but can deal different types of shots, depending on how long the user charges.\nTap shots are done by simply clicking the  button. They are quick, but deal very low damage and have little range. These should be used to quickly turf or to splat weakened opponents.\nPartial charges are done by holding the  button but not for the full time. They deal more damage but take more time to do than tap shots. If under a confrontation and without enough ink for Ink Mines, partial charge shots are preferred over tap shots\nFully charged shots deal damage to splat opponents in one hit, and gives the user the most range. Fully charged shots are best used for sniping and turfing long lines of ink.\n\n- Tap shots are done by simply clicking the  button. They are quick, but deal very low damage and have little range.

Fully charged shots are best used for sniping and turfing long lines of ink.\n\n- The greatest asset of the E-Liter 4K Scope is its range, giving the user a clear advantage over many opponents.\nThe range of a fully charged shot is 311 DU, giving it the most range of any weapon in Splatoon.\nThe range of fully charged shots can be used to pick off any other longer-ranged opponents such as the Jet Squelcher and the Custom Hydra Splatling.\nPartial charges can even be used to outrange shorter-ranged opponents, although they will not splat if the opponent is at full health.\nThe long range can put extra pressure on opponents entering the area, as they can easily be picked off with the range.\n\n- The range of a fully charged shot is 311 DU, giving it the most range of any weapon in Splatoon.\n\n- The range of fully charged shots can be used to pick off any other longer-ranged opponents such as the Jet Squelcher and the Custom Hydra Splatling.\n\n- Partial charges can even be used to outrange shorter-ranged opponents, although they will not splat if the opponent is at full health.\n\n- The long range can put extra pressure on opponents entering the area, as they can easily be picked off with the range.\n\n- While not the fastest, its long ranged charges paint extremely well, allowing the user to farm Ink Storms quickly.\nThe amount of specials an E-Liter 4K Scope can output is even more frequent than the Firefin Splatterscope.\n\n- The amount of specials an E-Liter 4K Scope can output is even more frequent than the Firefin Splatterscope.\n\n- Remember to use peeking to more effectively snipe targets whenever possible:\nBecause the E-Liter 4K Scope zooms in the view while charging, it may be beneficial to strafe and charge at the same time while aiming at a potential target.\nBecause all Inklings and Octolings are right-handed, right-side peeking is generally more effective than left-side peeking.[2]\n\n- Because the E-Liter 4K Scope zooms in the view while charging, it may be beneficial to strafe and charge at the same time while aiming at a potential target.\n\n- Because all Inklings and Octolings are right-handed, right-side peeking is generally more effective than left-side peeking.[2]\n\n- Unlike the original E-Liter 4K, the E-Liter 4K Scope cannot store a charge, reducing its mobility and hindering its ability to effectively left-side peek.\n\n- The E-Liter 4K Scope, like other chargers, suffers a few drawbacks.\nWithout full charges, an E-Liter 4K Scope user suffers at taking back turf. Sniping from a safer area further from opponents will allow the user to turf more efficiently.\nIts heavyweight nature makes swimming and running slower than usual. Its slow movement speed while charging a shot also makes the weapon very immobile. Be careful of any opponents charging in and remember to Super Jump out of any unfavorable situations.\nThe E-Liter 4K Scope consumes plenty of ink per fully charged shot (25% of the ink tank). To avoid getting caught with an empty tank, watch your ink consumption, avoid the opponent's ink and Toxic Mist, and remain nearby friendly ink in which you can hide, reload, and retreat if necessary.\nUsing a charger, especially a scoped one, can cause players to have tunnel vision as they focus on potential targets to snipe. Checking the map with  for the opponents' positions and movement patterns is important for any player, but it is very essential for an anchor, such as a Firefin Splatterscope wielder, to watch for any flanking attempts by the opponent, as getting flanked and splatted often leaves a gaping hole in their team's defenses.[3]\n\n- Without full charges, an E-Liter 4K Scope user suffers at taking back turf.

While this is usually not enough to either hold or recapture a zone, it can stall the opponents' efforts to capture it.\nAlthough no longer able to inflict lethal damage, an Ink Mine's chip damage and tracking effects can still deter opponents from immediately taking possession of the objective when placed either on the Tower or nearby the Rainmaker (when its shield is popped).\nPlacing an Ink Mine in an area where clams spawn can help track opponents who attempt to gather them.\n\n- An Ink Mine planted in a Splat Zone will re-turf the area around it once detonated.

Therefore, in Splat Zones, a team that is locked out will be unable to use Ink Mines effectively to push its way back to the zones.\n\n- …opposing ink appears within a five DU radius from the center of the mine.\n\n- …an opponent enters a 20 DU radius from the center of the mine.\n\n- …their user plants two more Mines before any are detonated.\n\n- …inflicts 45 HP of damage onto any opponent within a 40 DU radius (as of version 4.0.0).\n\n- …inflicts 35 HP of damage onto any opponent within an 80 DU radius (as of version 4.0.0).\n\n- …tracks any opponents surviving the damage for a base duration of five seconds.\n\n- …turfs the area around it within a radius of 50 DU.\n\n- An Ink Mine planted in a Splat Zone will re-turf the area around it once detonated.

Therefore, do not activate the special while being attacked, and make sure to throw it onto a surface before an opponent gets the opportunity to splat you.\n\n- Slower, less mobile opponents – especially Rainmaker carriers – are less capable of escaping Ink Storm's area of effect and, thus, are more adversely affected.\n\n- Ink Storm provides a good counter against Ink Armor, especially when paired with Object Shredder.\n\n- Ink Storm's damage on the opponent becomes more effective whenever the opponent has less space to maneuver around, such as in an alley or on the Tower.\n\n- Defensively, Ink Storm can slow or disrupt the opponents' push by either altering their intended attack routes or weakening any opponents within the storm.\n\n- Offensively, Ink Storm can soften opposing defenses by forcing opponents out of optimal positions and inflicting chip damage onto those caught in the ink rain.\n\n- Besides potentially damaging opponents, Ink Storm also gradually turfs any non-vertical surface it travels over:\nAlthough an Ink Storm may not be enough to capture an entire zone or two by itself, it can still help capture zones by pushing out opponents.\nWhile Bomb Launcher is more damaging and thorough in turfing, Ink Storm works automatically and allows its user to remain in relative safety.\nThe damaging and turfing effects of Ink Storm are slower and more gradual than those of a Booyah Bomb but last longer and affect a larger area, due to its drift.\n\n- Although an Ink Storm may not be enough to capture an entire zone or two by itself, it can still help capture zones by pushing out opponents.\n\n- While Bomb Launcher is more damaging and thorough in turfing, Ink Storm works automatically and allows its user to remain in relative safety.\n\n- The damaging and turfing effects of Ink Storm are slower and more gradual than those of a Booyah Bomb but last longer and affect a larger area, due to its drift.\n\n- An Ink Storm above the Rainmaker can either weaken its shield to pop it or prevent the opponent from popping it.\n\n- Special weapons are also free ink tank refills, allowing a E-Liter 4K user to launch Ink Storm and snipe opponents attempting to flee it.\n\n- Although an Ink Storm may not be enough to capture an entire zone or two by itself, it can still help capture zones by pushing out opponents.\n\n- While Bomb Launcher is more damaging and thorough in turfing, Ink Storm works automatically and allows its user to remain in relative safety.\n\n- The damaging and turfing effects of Ink Storm are slower and more gradual than those of a Booyah Bomb but last longer and affect a larger area, due to its drift.\n\nThe E-Liter 4K Scope's long range and high damage allow it to provide support fire and help maintain maintain spatial control, despite its lack of turfing compared to most of the other weapons of a team's composition. Therefore, it is generally redundant to have more than one long-ranged weapon on a team for a few reasons:[6]\n\n- A team with too many long-ranged weapons will have fewer mobile weapons that can more quickly capture turf and wrest control of the objective, hindering its ability to begin an effective push into the opponents' territory. Such a team will also have difficulty breaking out of an opponent's spawn camp.\n\n- Longer-ranged weapons, including the E-Liter 4K Scope, are generally less effective at close range, so a team with too many long-ranged weapons is more prone to getting flanked and sharked by the opponent than usual.\n\nBecause the E-Liter 4K is inefficient at turfing without full charges, its user will have to rely on their teammates to maintain map control. Not having enough turfing ability – usually from having too many blasters and chargers – presents its own set of problems:[6]\n\n- A team whose composition lacks enough turfing ability can be rendered immobile if the other team dominates map control.\n\n- A lack of turfing also makes it difficult to alter the course of a game, even after wiping out the other team.\n\nInk Mines cannot be thrown and cannot inflict lethal damage, making them less versatile than most bombs — particularly either Splat or Suction Bombs, which provide their user's team a couple advantages over another team that has no lethal bombs in its composition.[6]\n\n- Their one-hit-splat offers its user's team chances of instantly gaining a numbers advantage, from which a game-winning push can arise.\n\n- Their lethal explosion provides space for its user's team to either push into an area held by the opponent or stall an opponent's push.\n\nInk Storm is intended for either contesting territory, such as Splat Zones, or stalling opponents' pushes but is not as reliable at splatting opponents who actively avoid the Storm. Therefore, it is advised to have other special weapons available to complement Ink Storm, as having too many users of any combination of Ink Storm and Bomb Launcher (no more than two) in a team composition will limit a team's arsenal of weapons:[7]\n\n- Ink Storm provides no direct means of protection, meaning that opponents can still fire or throw sub weapons into the Storm.\n\n- Other special weapons, such as Inkjet or Sting Ray, are intended for splatting opponents and more capable at this than is Ink Storm.\n\nCombining Ink Storm with other specials can bolster a team's ability to either make a push or counter the opponents' push:\n\n- Ink Armor and other protective special weapons, such as Baller and Bubble Blower, can increase the survivability of a team as they push into contested territory.\n\n- After launching Ink Storm, a teammate who is using a special weapon designed for splat opponents, such as Sting Ray or Inkjet, can further limit the opponents' escape options or splat them as they scatter.\n\n- Users of other anchor's weapons each have to confront a E-Liter 4K Scope differently:\nDuels between chargers often boil down to skill, positioning, turf control, and the presence of other teammates. However, note the differences between different chargers and play to your weapon's strengths:\nThanks to its ability to store a charge, the unscoped E-Liter 4K is more mobile than the E-Liter 4K Scope, but the latter has more range.\nThe Squiffer and Bamboozler 14 Mk I are more mobile, but each one lacks either range or damage output.\nThe Custom Jet Squelcher has a shorter effective range (212.64 DU[8]) than that of the E-Liter 4K Scope but is more mobile and slightly more competent in a close-quarters battle. However, instead of trying to flank or shark a E-Liter 4K Scope, it might be easier to simply farm Sting Ray and use it to constantly harass them, disrupting their ability to snipe your teammates.\nThe Dynamo Roller, Explosher, and all splatlings are outranged by the E-Liter 4K Scope and lack the mobility to effectively challenge them:\nFocus more on turfing and providing support fire for your teammates while keeping an eye on the opposing E-Liter 4K Scope user's position.\nOnly challenge the opposing E-Liter 4K Scope user if your position is more advantageous or if you need to distract them from sniping an important teammate, such as the Tower rider or Rainmaker carrier.\n\n- Duels between chargers often boil down to skill, positioning, turf control, and the presence of other teammates.

Rely on flanking or sharking to get within range of an opposing Firefin Splatterscope user. However, be wary of the Splash Wall they might drop.\n\n- Throwing bombs or Toxic Mist at an opposing E-Liter 4K Scope user can briefly force them out of position and throw off their aim. While Toxic Mist does not damage the opponent, it drains their ink tank and limits their movement, making them more vulnerable to a direct assault.\n\n- If you see opposing turf, use bombs, a Sprinkler, or medium- to long-ranged weapons to sweep the area of any mines to avoid getting tracked. Special weapons that turf large areas without endangering their user – such as Bomb Launcher, Ink Storm, and Booyah Bomb – can also remove any hidden mines.\n\n- If caught by the tracking effects of an opponent's Ink Mine, consider either retreating or diverting the opponents' attention away from the objective.\n\n- When facing an opposing Ink Storm, assess where is a safe place to either reroute an attack or reposition on defense:\nIn general, avoid getting caught under an opponent's Ink Storm for an extended time, but also be wary of opponents waiting to pick off anyone fleeing the Storm.\n\n- In general, avoid getting caught under an opponent's Ink Storm for an extended time, but also be wary of opponents waiting to pick off anyone fleeing the Storm.\n\n- When facing a team who possesses both Ink Storm and main weapons whose damage is increased with Main Power Up, pay extra attention to where the Main Power Up-boosted opponents are at whenever they launch their Ink Storm.\nIf you must travel under an opponent's Ink Storm, avoid moving in the same direction that the Storm is traveling to minimize damage.\nEven while avoiding an opponent's Ink Storm, it is still possible to turf or otherwise influence the area underneath. Long-ranged weapons, thrown sub weapons, and other special weapons (such as a counter-Ink Storm or Bomb Launcher) can splat opponents or dissuade them from occupying the turf underneath.\n\n- If you must travel under an opponent's Ink Storm, avoid moving in the same direction that the Storm is traveling to minimize damage.\n\n- Even while avoiding an opponent's Ink Storm, it is still possible to turf or otherwise influence the area underneath.

Long-ranged weapons, thrown sub weapons, and other special weapons (such as a counter-Ink Storm or Bomb Launcher) can splat opponents or dissuade them from occupying the turf underneath.\n\nGear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.\n\nEver since its introduction in version 4.3.0, Bomb Defense Up DX will not only reduce the damage taken from opposing sub and special weapons that are not one-hit-splat but will also reduce the duration of the tracking effects of certain opponent's sub and special weapons, such as Point Sensors and Ink Mines, allowing the user of this ability to evade detection more easily. Since the E-Liter 4K Scope is prone to being attacked by bombs and Tenta Missiles due to it being an anchor, having this ability is great for improving its survivability - especially considering how slow it is. Just three ability points, or one sub, offer plenty of utility:[9][10]\n\n- The splash damage of most bombs is reduced from 30 HP to 28.6 HP. This reduction in damage provides two benefits:\nIt prevents its user from being exposed on their opponents' map by the splash damage of most single bombs.\nInk Armor will not break due to splash damage from a single bomb whose splash damage normally inflicts 30 HP of damage.\n\n- It prevents its user from being exposed on their opponents' map by the splash damage of most single bombs.\n\n- Ink Armor will not break due to splash damage from a single bomb whose splash damage normally inflicts 30 HP of damage.\n\n- The splash damage of near-misses from either Tenta Missiles or Inkjet, the minimum splash damage of bubbles, and the collision damage from Baller are all reduced from 50 HP to 48.3 HP, enabling one to survive two hits from any of these specific means of special weapon damage.\n\n- It prevents its user from being exposed on their opponents' map by the splash damage of most single bombs.\n\n- Ink Armor will not break due to splash damage from a single bomb whose splash damage normally inflicts 30 HP of damage.\n\nLike most anchors, an E-Liter 4K Scope user generally keeps their distance from the opponent. However, they can expect to come in contact with opposing ink on various surfaces. While in contact with opposing ink, Ink Resistance Up both delays and reduces the damage taken and partially offsets reduction in running speed — including while charging a shot.\n\n- Just three ability points – or one sub – delays the damage taken from opposing ink by 10 frames, reduces the damage taken from 0.3 HP/f (health points per frame) to 0.2 HP/f, lowers the limit on the amount of damage opposing ink on surfaces can inflict from 40 HP to 38 HP, and increases the normal running speed in opposing ink from 0.24 DU/f to 0.33 DU/f.\n\n- Six ability points – or two subs – delays the damage taken from opposing ink by 15 frames, reduces the damage taken to 0.2 HP/f, lowers the damage limit of opposing ink to 36.2 HP, and increases the normal running speed in opposing ink to 0.39 DU/f.\n\nThe E-Liter 4K Scope needs to consume a large amount of ink (25% of the ink tank) to fully charge its shots. Ink Saver (Main) not only allows it to fire more fully charged shots per ink tank but also conserves ink for a potential Ink Mine, in case an opponent gets too close.\n\n- 10 ability points, or one main, allows the weapon to fire five full charges.\n\nMain Power Up increases the range and turfing ability for the E-Liter 4K Scope. While it already has the best range of any weapon, the extra range can allow the user to snipe opponents from further distances. The increased painting ability also lets the user farm Ink Storms more often.\n\nQuick Super Jump decreases both the \"charge\" time before and the travel time of a Super Jump, allowing its user to escape more quickly. An E-Liter 4K Scope wielder is usually vulnerable in close quarters and would also have an incentive to maintain valuable special gauge progress for their Ink Storm.\n\n- Six ability points, or two subs, of Quick Super Jump decreases the \"charge\" time by 30 frames, or 0.5 seconds.\n\nWith its range, the user can splat opponents without entering into enemy fire, leaving the user splatting opponents more than getting splatted. Respawn Punisher can be used to increase the time opponents are splatted, allowing a team to follow up with a push, with a less chance of the user being punished themselves.\n\nDue to being a heavyweight weapon, the E-Liter 4K Scope inherently slows the swim speed of its user.
