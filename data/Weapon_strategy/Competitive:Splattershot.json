  "content": "The Splattershot (as well as the Hero and Order Shot Replicas) is the second available weapon in every game of the Splatoon series. As an all-around, short-ranged shooter with a moderate fire rate, a three-shot-splat, good accuracy, and good mobility, it can quickly splat opponents and ink surfaces to maintain map control or farm its special weapon. Depending on its provided kit, it can potentially fit in many different team compositions.\n\n- 1 Splatoon\n\n1.1 Use\n1.2 Synergy\n1.3 Countermeasures\n1.4 Gear abilities\n1.5 In competitive play\n\n- 1.1 Use\n\n- 1.2 Synergy\n\n- 1.3 Countermeasures\n\n- 1.4 Gear abilities\n\n- 1.5 In competitive play\n\n- 2 Splatoon 2\n\n2.1 Use\n2.2 Synergy\n2.3 Countermeasures\n2.4 Gear abilities\n\n- 2.1 Use\n\n- 2.2 Synergy\n\n- 2.3 Countermeasures\n\n- 2.4 Gear abilities\n\n- 3 Splatoon 3\n\n3.1 Use\n3.2 Synergy\n3.3 Countermeasures\n3.4 Gear abilities\n3.5 In competitive play\n\n- 3.1 Use\n\n- 3.2 Synergy\n\n- 3.3 Countermeasures\n\n- 3.4 Gear abilities\n\n- 3.5 In competitive play\n\n- 4 References\n\n- 1.1 Use\n\n- 1.2 Synergy\n\n- 1.3 Countermeasures\n\n- 1.4 Gear abilities\n\n- 1.5 In competitive play\n\n- 2.1 Use\n\n- 2.2 Synergy\n\n- 2.3 Countermeasures\n\n- 2.4 Gear abilities\n\n- 3.1 Use\n\n- 3.2 Synergy\n\n- 3.3 Countermeasures\n\n- 3.4 Gear abilities\n\n- 3.5 In competitive play\n\nThe Splattershot has Burst Bombs and Burst Bomb Rush to supplement its already great mobility and effectiveness on offense. However, the absence of a lethal bomb reduces its user's ability to deny space, and the inability to extend the throwing range of Burst Bomb Rush reduces its utility.[1]\n\nCompared to its Splatoon 2 appearance, the Splattershot has some minor tweaks that slightly hurt its performance, though the weapon itself is still solid:\n\n- The Splattershot deals 35 damage instead of 36.\n\n- The weapon also has weaker falloff damage, making splats outside of effective range less consistent than in Splatoon 2.\n\n- While jumping, the weapon is slightly less accurate than in Splatoon 2.\n\n- Mobility is slightly worse, as there is more endlag when switching between swimming to shooting, or using a sub weapon (3 frames).\n\n- Ink will be less likely to appear at the player's feet compared to Splatoon 2.\n\n- The weapon is slightly more ink efficient, consuming 0.9% of the ink tank per shot while in Splatoon 2, it consumes 0.92%, though this is a largely negligible difference.\n\nBurst Bombs function exactly the same as they do in Splatoon 2, except for Ink Saver (Sub) having better stacking on them in this game.\n\nLike most of its variants, the Bomb Rush is designed to either help push into a highly contested area or help repel the opponent's push:\n\n- Using any Bomb Rush too close to an opponent will leave its user vulnerable to attack, so activate it outside the range of the opponent.\n\n- Bomb Range Up can increase the distance of every Burst Bomb thrown during the Bomb Rush.\n\n- Do not forget that the main weapon may still be used during the duration of the special. Not only is this a useful self-defense tactic in case an opponent gets close, it is also a very effective means for creating combos, particularly to make up for the lower damage inflicted by Burst Bombs compared to other bombs.\n\n- Because Burst Bombs have less damage and turfing ability than most other bombs, a Burst Bomb Rush does not create space or push into contested turf through sheer damage or turfing but through the pressure created by its higher fire rate.[2]\n\n- An opponent's Inkstrike will defuse any of your Burst Bombs it comes in contact with, so hold off on activating Bomb Rush until after the opponent's special weapon finishes.\n\nThe Burst Bomb Rush can help a Splattershot user in contesting territory, such as Splat Zones. However, it is not as reliable at turfing territory compared to other Bomb Launcher variants. Moreover, a Splattershot user who attempts to pursue certain opponents with Burst Bomb Rush risks getting splatted. Therefore, it is advised for the Splattershot user's teammates to have other special weapons available to complement Burst Bomb Rush, as having too many users of any Bomb Rush variant (no more than two) in a team composition will limit a team's arsenal of weapons:[3]\n\n- Other than the launched bombs, a Bomb Launcher user has no means of protection and is particularly vulnerable to long-ranged fire.\n\n- Other special weapons intended for splatting opponents, such as Kraken or Killer Wail, can do this with less risk of getting splatted.\n\n- Keep an eye on the HUD to check when an opposing Splattershot user has their Bomb Rush ready to avoid getting caught in surprise.\n\n- Long-ranged weapons, such as chargers can pick off opposing Bomb Rush users who recklessly come within range.\n\n- Certain special weapons, such as Inkstrike can negate the opponents' bombs if timed properly.\n\n- A counter Bomb Rush can nullify the effects of the opponent's Bomb Rush, preventing its user's team from either capping a zone or continuing a push.\n\nGear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.\n\nBomb Range Up is the bread and butter of a vanilla Splattershot build, allowing it to perform its role as a support with long-range Burst Bombs.[4] This ability also affects Burst Bombs thrown from a Bomb Rush.\n\nDamage Up increases damage of the main, sub, and special weapons. Damage Up can increase damage to allow the user to combo with their Burst Bombs more often and to increase the Burst Bombs in their Bomb Rush, making the special more lethal.\n\n- 6 ability points, or two subs, will increase the weapon's damage to 36.98 and direct Burst Bomb hits to 63.39, making a direct hit from a Burst Bomb and one shot from the main weapon splat an opponent without Defense Up.[5]\n\nA pure of this ability will allow its user to throw three Burst Bombs from a full ink tank.\n\nQuick Respawn always shortens the time taken to respawn, allow a Splattershot user to be aggressive without much consequences.\n\nIn competitive, the vanilla Splattershot saw use mainly as a Burst Bomb spammer, poking at the opponents and even their anchors while using Bomb Range Up.[4] This is due to its other two variants having better kits for a slayer role, and the Refurbished Mini Splatling, which shares the same kit as this weapon, lacking gear space to perform this role.[4]\n\nThe Splattershot – as well as the Hero Shot Replica – is the second available weapon in Splatoon 2 only to the Splattershot Jr. (not counting the Octo Shot Replica, which can be acquired after the completion of Octo Expansion). Compared to the Splattershot Jr., the Splattershot has higher damage, a slightly longer range, and nearly as good a fire rate and turfing ability but has a different sub weapon and a less versatile special weapon.[9]\n\nThe Splattershot fires rapidly and turfs very well, but its higher damage and slightly longer range than a Splattershot Jr. makes it a slayer weapon:\n\n- Its damage per shot (36 HP, or health points) is considerably higher than that of the Splattershot Jr. (28 HP), allowing it to splat most opponents in just three hits.\nHowever, shots that travel further than its effective range (see below) will suffer falloff until it reaches 17.5 HP of damage after 24 frames, requiring up to six hits to splat opponents.\nIt is still usually more advantageous to fire at opponents from an elevated position – despite any resulting damage falloff – than it is to drop down and engage them at their level. Otherwise, fire at opponents when they are within the effective range to maximize damage output.\n\n- However, shots that travel further than its effective range (see below) will suffer falloff until it reaches 17.5 HP of damage after 24 frames, requiring up to six hits to splat opponents.\n\n- It is still usually more advantageous to fire at opponents from an elevated position – despite any resulting damage falloff – than it is to drop down and engage them at their level. Otherwise, fire at opponents when they are within the effective range to maximize damage output.\n\n- Its range (116.99 DU, or distance units, or over two distance lines away in the test range)[10] is slightly longer than that of the Splattershot Jr. (103.89 DU),[10] giving its user an inherent advantage over shorter-ranged weapons, such as most rollers. Simply maintain your distance from a shorter-ranged opponent while firing at them to minimize the damage taken from them.\n\n- While middleweight weapons such as the Splattershot generally have average mobility – 0.96 DU/f, or distance units per frame, while running, 1.92 DU/f while swimming[11] – the Splattershot is very mobile in two other ways:\nIts running speed while firing (0.72 DU/f) is above average among shooters.\nIt has a short interval between firing and either using a sub weapon or morphing into squid or octopus form (4 frames).\nThis extra mobility allows its user to apply pressure onto the opponent — whether head-on or through timely flanking, more quickly respond on defense, and more easily dodge opposing fire.\n\n- Its running speed while firing (0.72 DU/f) is above average among shooters.\n\n- It has a short interval between firing and either using a sub weapon or morphing into squid or octopus form (4 frames).\n\n- This extra mobility allows its user to apply pressure onto the opponent — whether head-on or through timely flanking, more quickly respond on defense, and more easily dodge opposing fire.\n\n- The Splattershot is also faster and more efficient at turfing than most other slayer weapons, allowing its user to both maintain map control and build up its special weapon more quickly than most other weapons can.\n\n- The Splattershot has shorter range than most other weapons, such as the Splattershot Pro, sloshers, and especially chargers and splatlings, all which can fire upon a Splattershot user before the latter has a chance to land a shot. Therefore, a Splattershot user has to attack them in a different way than a head-on approach:\nOne way to effectively attack an opponent with a longer ranged weapon is to flank them, or approach them from either the side or behind, while their attention is towards the front lines. If performed correctly, this can either catch the opponent by surprise or at least divert their attention away from the front, allowing one of your teammates to splat them.\nAnother method to attack a longer-ranged opponent is sharking, or hiding – usually in friendly ink out of the opponents' sight – until the opponent gets within your range before attacking. Sharking can work against any opponent – regardless of their weapon's range – who is caught unawares.\n\n- One way to effectively attack an opponent with a longer ranged weapon is to flank them, or approach them from either the side or behind, while their attention is towards the front lines.

This provides a few advantages over Splat Bombs:\nThey can more quickly damage opponents, which makes them suitable for leading off attacks, breaking opponents' Ink Armor, or finishing off injured opponents who attempt to flee. This provides the Splattershot good combo potential with Burst Bombs.\nThey effectively extend the range at which their user can quickly damage their opponents. The Splattershot user benefits again due to the short range of their main weapon.\nThey instantly turf inkable surfaces, permitting either a fast pursuit of an opponent or a rapid retreat from an unfavorable situation. This trait further increases the high mobility of a Splattershot user. Also, any opponents hit by Burst Bombs will be surrounded by your team's ink, further limiting their health and mobility.\n\n- They can more quickly damage opponents, which makes them suitable for leading off attacks, breaking opponents' Ink Armor, or finishing off injured opponents who attempt to flee.

Always go for direct hits whenever possible.\nTheir blast radius is only 30 DU — equal to the lethal blast radius of Splat Bombs. Targets within 25 DU to the Burst Bomb's explosion will take 35 HP of damage, while farther ones will take 25 HP.\n\n- Only direct hits will inflict 60 HP of damage, while splash damage will only deliver 25-35 HP.

Therefore, a Splattershot user can throw Burst Bombs before and after using Splashdown to confirm a splat.\n\n- They can more quickly damage opponents, which makes them suitable for leading off attacks, breaking opponents' Ink Armor, or finishing off injured opponents who attempt to flee.

A Super Jumping Splashdown is executed by pressing  in the middle of a Super Jump.\nPressing  before or at the apex of the Super Jump will execute Splashdown immediately upon landing, while pressing  after the Super Jump apex will delay the Splashdown. While the former method is quicker, the latter provides the flexibility of holding onto Splashdown in case it is not needed.\n\n- Pressing  before or at the apex of the Super Jump will execute Splashdown immediately upon landing, while pressing  after the Super Jump apex will delay the Splashdown. While the former method is quicker, the latter provides the flexibility of holding onto Splashdown in case it is not needed.\n\n- As of version 1.3.0, the windup delay from the time  is pressed to the moment Splashdown is detonated is 1.2 seconds for a normal Splashdown and 0.8 seconds for a Super Jump Splashdown.\nPerforming a normal Splashdown while underneath an obstacle (e.g. the grate walkways in Kelp Dome, the grate surrounding the Tower in Tower Control) will reduce the height of the player's jump during the windup but will not affect its duration.\n\n- Performing a normal Splashdown while underneath an obstacle (e.g. the grate walkways in Kelp Dome, the grate surrounding the Tower in Tower Control) will reduce the height of the player's jump during the windup but will not affect its duration.\n\n- A player performing a normal Splashdown is invincible both during the first five frames, or 0.083 seconds, and upon landing for 30 frames, or 0.5 seconds, but is vulnerable to attack during the rest of the special. Opponents will have this brief window of vulnerability to attack the player performing Splashdown – with ranged weapons, bombs (if thrown in advance), and some special weapons.\nThe further an opponent is from a player performing a normal Splashdown, the easier it is for the former to adjust their aim upward to splat the latter[14] and the less likely they will take significant damage (see below).\nStarting from version 4.1.0, a player who is splatted in the middle of attempting to perform Splashdown will only suffer a special gauge reduction of 25% (with no Special Saver). However, if splatted by an opponent equipped with either Haunt (when active) or Respawn Punisher, then the special gauge penalty is 40%.\nTherefore, if you intend to use Splashdown within the range of an opponent, generally do so when close to them.\n\n- The further an opponent is from a player performing a normal Splashdown, the easier it is for the former to adjust their aim upward to splat the latter[14] and the less likely they will take significant damage (see below).\n\n- Starting from version 4.1.0, a player who is splatted in the middle of attempting to perform Splashdown will only suffer a special gauge reduction of 25% (with no Special Saver).

Super Jumping into Splashdown can still be used to push back the opponents and gain space for teammates.\n\n- While this can surprise and splat some opponents who attempt to camp the Super Jump marker, those who pay attention to the HUD will keep their distance from the marker. Super Jumping into Splashdown can still be used to push back the opponents and gain space for teammates.\n\n- The amount of damage Splashdown inflicts onto a target depends on its distance from the epicenter of the explosion:\nTargets within the lethal splash radius of about 70 DU – marked by a bright circle that appears as a player initiates Splashdown – receive 180 HP of damage, most likely splatting those not protected by Ink Armor, Baller, or Booyah Bomb armor. The higher Splashdown is activated, the wider the lethal splash radius.\nTargets that are just outside the splash radius – up to about 100 DU from the center – receive 70 damage, while those that are even further – about 145 DU – receive 55 damage as of version 1.3.0. These distances are not affected by the height at which Splashdown is activated.\nIn addition, opponents that survive the Splashdown might suffer knockback, especially if they are either wearing Ink Armor or using Baller.\n\n- Targets within the lethal splash radius of about 70 DU – marked by a bright circle that appears as a player initiates Splashdown – receive 180 HP of damage, most likely splatting those not protected by Ink Armor, Baller, or Booyah Bomb armor.

Coordinate with teammates to gain an opportunity to reach the zone, as opponents will quickly splat anyone attempting to rush the zone.\nSuper Jumping to a teammate who manages to get to the middle of the zone can provide a safer, more guaranteed means to cap it.\n\n- Turfing a path with the main weapon, Burst Bombs, or a combination of the two can enable one to quickly reach the zone for an instant Splashdown.

It cannot push back opponents as effectively as Baller, Bomb Launcher, Booyah Bomb, or even Ink Storm can.\n\n- An opponent who is skilled at splatting Splashdown attempts could effectively neutralize the special weapon of anyone with Splashdown due to its mostly consistent height, duration, and pattern.\n\nIf you regularly keep track of your teammates' locations with the map (by pressing ), you might find opportune moments to use a Super Jumping Splashdown to secure control of important areas, such as onto the Tower or just underneath the opponents' clam basket.\n\n- Matchups between Splattershots on opposing teams are determined by each player's skill, positioning, turf control, and the presence of any teammates.\n\n- Any weapon that has a combination of longer range, better accuracy, or higher damage output without sacrificing too much mobility can counter a Splattershot. For example, the Splattershot Pro, the L-3 Nozzlenose, the Dualie Squelchers and their respective variants meet all of these requirements. However, watch out for any Burst Bombs the opposing Splattershot user might throw.\n\n- If using a shorter ranged weapon against an opposing Splattershot user, such as a Splat Roller, rely on flanking or sharking them instead of a direct attack.\n\n- A long-ranged weapon, such as a charger or most splatlings, can attack an opposing Splattershot user from long distance with impunity. However, once the latter gets close, they can outmaneuver and outdraw its less mobile, slower firing opponent.\n\n- A competent Splattershot user is likely capable at both flanking and sharking:\nKeep track of all four members of the opposing team – which ones are present, which ones are splatted, and which ones are back at their spawn point.\nCheck the map periodically for opposing ink forming around flanks to anticipate a flanking attack.\nTo prevent sharking, check suspicious puddles of the opponents' ink, preferably with a thrown sub weapon.\nWeapons that track opponents, such as Point Sensors, temporarily prevent an opponent from sharking and make them an easier target for long-ranged teammates to pick off.\n\n- Keep track of all four members of the opposing team – which ones are present, which ones are splatted, and which ones are back at their spawn point.\n\n- Check the map periodically for opposing ink forming around flanks to anticipate a flanking attack.\n\n- To prevent sharking, check suspicious puddles of the opponents' ink, preferably with a thrown sub weapon.\n\n- Weapons that track opponents, such as Point Sensors, temporarily prevent an opponent from sharking and make them an easier target for long-ranged teammates to pick off.\n\n- When pursued by an opposing Splattershot user, using almost any sub weapon (except for Squid Beakons) can either delay their pursuit or deter them from chasing.\n\n- Keep an eye on the HUD to know when an opposing Splattershot user has Splashdown ready to use, and be ready for activation when fighting them.\n\n- If you have good aim, you can try to shoot the Splashdown out of the air:\nShort-ranged weapons – such as the Inkbrush or the Sploosh-o-matic – or slower weapons – such as the Dynamo Roller or the Explosher – will struggle to do so, in which case it is better to simply back off instead.\n\n- Short-ranged weapons – such as the Inkbrush or the Sploosh-o-matic – or slower weapons – such as the Dynamo Roller or the Explosher – will struggle to do so, in which case it is better to simply back off instead.\n\n- Watch out for any suspicious Super Jump markers. If a Super Jump marker appears in a risky spot, such as on the front lines, it is likely that the opponent is attempting a Super Jumping Splashdown. Instead of camping it with your main weapon, toss a bomb over to the marker instead if you have one.\n\n- Protective special weapons, such as Ink Armor and Baller, can reduce or mitigate the damage taken from an opponent's Splashdown, but be wary of the large knockback.\n\n- Keep track of all four members of the opposing team – which ones are present, which ones are splatted, and which ones are back at their spawn point.\n\n- Check the map periodically for opposing ink forming around flanks to anticipate a flanking attack.\n\n- To prevent sharking, check suspicious puddles of the opponents' ink, preferably with a thrown sub weapon.\n\n- Weapons that track opponents, such as Point Sensors, temporarily prevent an opponent from sharking and make them an easier target for long-ranged teammates to pick off.\n\n- Short-ranged weapons – such as the Inkbrush or the Sploosh-o-matic – or slower weapons – such as the Dynamo Roller or the Explosher – will struggle to do so, in which case it is better to simply back off instead.\n\nGear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.\n\nEver since its introduction in version 4.3.0, Bomb Defense Up DX will not only reduce the damage taken from opposing sub and special weapons that are not one-hit-splat but will also reduce the duration of the tracking effects of certain opponent's sub and special weapons, such as Point Sensors and Ink Mines, allowing the user of this ability to evade detection more easily. Because the Splattershot works optimally at short range, its user risks damage from both bombs and special weapons and can greatly benefit from reducing the damage taken from them. Just three ability points, or one sub, offer plenty of utility:[16][17]\n\n- The splash damage of most bombs is reduced from 30 HP to 28.6 HP. This reduction in damage provides two benefits:\nIt prevents its user from being exposed on their opponents' map by the splash damage of most single bombs.\nInk Armor will not break due to splash damage from a single bomb whose splash damage normally inflicts 30 HP of damage.\n\n- It prevents its user from being exposed on their opponents' map by the splash damage of most single bombs.\n\n- Ink Armor will not break due to splash damage from a single bomb whose splash damage normally inflicts 30 HP of damage.\n\n- The splash damage of near-misses from either Tenta Missiles or Inkjet, the minimum splash damage of bubbles, and the collision damage from Baller are all reduced from 50 HP to 48.3 HP,[18] enabling one to survive two hits from any of these specific means of special weapon damage.\n\n- It prevents its user from being exposed on their opponents' map by the splash damage of most single bombs.\n\n- Ink Armor will not break due to splash damage from a single bomb whose splash damage normally inflicts 30 HP of damage.\n\nAs a slayer, a Splattershot user has to risk getting splatted often. When equipped, Comeback grants ten ability points of six different stackable abilities for twenty seconds after respawning from getting splatted by an opponent:\n\n- Ink Recovery Up\n\n- Ink Saver (Main)\n\n- Ink Saver (Sub)\n\n- Run Speed Up\n\n- Swim Speed Up\n\n- Special Charge Up\n\nInk Saver (Sub) and Swim Speed Up are particularly useful for the Splattershot, allowing its user to consume less ink and maintain pressure on the opponent upon returning from spawn.[16]\n\nA Splattershot user can expect to come in contact with the opponent's ink on various surfaces, which can both be damaging and reduce mobility. Ink Resistance Up not only partially offsets the reduction in mobility but also delays the damage taken from contact with opposing ink.[16][17]\n\n- Just three ability points, or one sub,…\n…delays the damage taken from opposing ink by 10 frames.\n…reduces the damage taken from 0.3 HP/f (health points per frame) to 0.2 HP/f.\n…lowers the limit on the amount of damage opposing ink on surfaces can inflict from 40 HP to 38 HP.\n…increases the normal running speed in opposing ink from 0.24 DU/f to 0.33 DU/f.[11]\n…increases the jumping height in opposing ink from 0.8 to 0.854.[18]\n\n- …delays the damage taken from opposing ink by 10 frames.\n\n- …reduces the damage taken from 0.3 HP/f (health points per frame) to 0.2 HP/f.\n\n- …lowers the limit on the amount of damage opposing ink on surfaces can inflict from 40 HP to 38 HP.\n\n- …increases the normal running speed in opposing ink from 0.24 DU/f to 0.33 DU/f.[11]\n\n- …increases the jumping height in opposing ink from 0.8 to 0.854.[18]\n\n- Six ability points, or two subs,…\n…delays the damage taken from opposing ink by 15 frames.\n…reduces the damage taken to 0.2 HP/f.\n…lowers the damage limit of opposing ink to 36.2 HP.\n…increases the normal running speed in opposing ink to 0.39 DU/f.[11]\n…increases the jumping height in opposing ink to 0.888.[18]\n\n- …delays the damage taken from opposing ink by 15 frames.\n\n- …reduces the damage taken to 0.2 HP/f.\n\n- …lowers the damage limit of opposing ink to 36.2 HP.\n\n- …increases the normal running speed in opposing ink to 0.39 DU/f.[11]\n\n- …increases the jumping height in opposing ink to 0.888.[18]\n\n- …delays the damage taken from opposing ink by 10 frames.\n\n- …reduces the damage taken from 0.3 HP/f (health points per frame) to 0.2 HP/f.\n\n- …lowers the limit on the amount of damage opposing ink on surfaces can inflict from 40 HP to 38 HP.\n\n- …increases the normal running speed in opposing ink from 0.24 DU/f to 0.33 DU/f.[11]\n\n- …increases the jumping height in opposing ink from 0.8 to 0.854.[18]\n\n- …delays the damage taken from opposing ink by 15 frames.\n\n- …reduces the damage taken to 0.2 HP/f.\n\n- …lowers the damage limit of opposing ink to 36.2 HP.\n\n- …increases the normal running speed in opposing ink to 0.39 DU/f.[11]\n\n- …increases the jumping height in opposing ink to 0.888.[18]\n\nMain Power Up increases accuracy while either on the ground or in midair, allowing a Splattershot user to maintain some accuracy while jumping.[16]\n\nQuick Respawn shortens respawn time after getting splatted (under specific conditions), encouraging a Splattershot user to remain aggressive even after getting splatted.\n\n- 16 ability points – one main and two subs – are enough to reduce the respawn time from 8.5 seconds to 6.67 seconds.\n\n- 26 ability points – two mains and two subs – are enough to reduce the respawn time from 8.5 seconds to 5.8 seconds.[11]\n\nSuper Jumping to a teammate after respawning carries the risk of getting splatted upon landing, due to the appearance of a Super Jump indicator. When equipped, Stealth Jump better covers this indicator from long distance opponents, allowing its user to more safely return to the front lines and maintain pressure on the opponent.\n\nA self-explanatory ability, Swim Speed Up enables an already mobile Splattershot user to more rapidly close the distance towards an opponent, more quickly respond to an opponents' push, or even escape unfavorable situations.\n\n- 16 ability points – one main and two subs – increase the swim speed from 1.92 to 2.14 units per frame.[11]\n\n- Swim Speed Up can reduce the swim speed penalty from Ninja Squid. However, it takes at least 28 ability points – either one main and six subs or about two mains and three subs – of Swim Speed Up for a Splattershot user to fully offset the swimming speed penalty of Ninja Squid.[11]\n\n- Therefore, a Splattershot user with Ninja Squid will have to decide between either having fewer ability points available for other abilities or swimming at less than the base maximum speed. For example, just 13 ability points – one main and one sub – are enough to restore the swim speed of a Splattershot user with Ninja Squid to 1.92 units per frame.[11]\n\n[19]\n\nThe iconic Splattershot once again returns in Splatoon 3 with a new design and the same sub and similar special weapon as the Tentatek Splattershot in the original Splatoon, allowing its user to play either aggressively or defensively depending on the situation.\n\nThe Splattershot is primarily a slayer but also has the tools to play supportively as well:\n\n- Its good damage, good accuracy (improved further in version 4.1.0), and rapid fire rate make it very effective at quickly splatting opponents.\nAutomatic shooters like the Splattershot tend to be most accurate when the user starts to fire, losing accuracy and increasing its spread as the fire button is held, and resetting its accuracy after a certain amount of time where the weapon is not being fired. In the Splattershot's case, it takes 22 frames, or under half a second, to restore the weapon's precision after firing.\nWhen fighting opponents, it is recommended to take advantage of the good starting accuracy and take the initiative on opponents to splat them quickly and efficiently.\nOtherwise, in drawn-out firefights, reset the accuracy every so often by swimming or even squid rolling for brief moments to reposition.\nLosing accuracy isn't necessarily a downside outside of combat, as the increased spread will further improve the weapon's turfing. Just make sure to reset the accuracy before getting into a fight.\nIt does 36 damage per shot, once again allowing it to splat opponents in three hits.\n\n- Automatic shooters like the Splattershot tend to be most accurate when the user starts to fire, losing accuracy and increasing its spread as the fire button is held, and resetting its accuracy after a certain amount of time where the weapon is not being fired.

Just make sure to reset the accuracy before getting into a fight.\n\n- It does 36 damage per shot, once again allowing it to splat opponents in three hits.\n\n- Due to good ink efficiency at 0.92% per shot, a good fire rate, and Suction Bombs, the Splattershot is good at turfing, allowing it to get its special weapon more easily than some other slayer weapons.\n\n- Its good mobility allows its user to apply pressure onto the opponent – whether head-on or through timely flanking – eliminating key defenders during a push.\n\n- Defensively, its rapid rate of fire makes it great at both sharking to pick off unaware opponents and turfing to maintain map control. Its good ink efficiency also allows its user to more readily use Suction Bombs to keep opponents at bay.\n\n- The Splattershot is faster and more efficient at turfing than most other weapons, allowing its user to both maintain map control and build up the special gauge for its Trizooka more quickly than most other weapons.\n\n- Automatic shooters like the Splattershot tend to be most accurate when the user starts to fire, losing accuracy and increasing its spread as the fire button is held, and resetting its accuracy after a certain amount of time where the weapon is not being fired.

Just make sure to reset the accuracy before getting into a fight.\n\nDespite its many strengths, the Splattershot still has a few weaknesses its user has to account for:\n\n- Its short range (116.99 DU) puts its user at a disadvantage against opponents with longer ranged weapons, such as a slosher, a splatana, the .52 Gal (124.944 DU), or the Dark Tetra Dualies (132.5 DU).[22] Avoid head-on encounters against these opponents and instead rely more on flanking or sharking.\nHowever, the range gives the weapon an advantage over shorter-ranged weapons like rollers and the Splattershot Jr..\n\n- However, the range gives the weapon an advantage over shorter-ranged weapons like rollers and the Splattershot Jr..\n\n- While the Splattershot fires rapidly, should an opponent armed with a Splash-o-matic or N-ZAP '85 land their first two shots before getting hit, they would be at an advantage due to their even higher firing rate.\n\n- However, the range gives the weapon an advantage over shorter-ranged weapons like rollers and the Splattershot Jr..\n\nSuction Bombs can be used in a similar fashion to Splat Bombs, with a few differences:\n\n- They can attach to surfaces, which both allows more room for error when aiming and enables the planting of craftier traps, such as underneath a grate.\n\n- They take two seconds after attaching to a surface to detonate, as opposed to one second for a Splat Bomb, so plant Suction Bombs earlier than usual.\n\n- They have a larger overall radius of damage (80 DU).\n\n- They can be thrown to lead a push into a Splat Zone or any other important area of the stage, such as the opponents' street or platform.\n\n- They can also flush out opposing anchors from perches and clear other critical areas, such as the Tower.[23]\n\n- They can also be used to poke at and zone out opponents during the neutral phase, stall an opponent's push, or provide space to escape.\n\n- A Suction Bomb can damage or destroy an opponent's brella shield, Splash Wall, or the Rainmaker shield, while detonating on contact.\nAny opponents caught within the Suction Bomb's explosion will get damaged or splatted.[24]\n\n- Any opponents caught within the Suction Bomb's explosion will get damaged or splatted.[24]\n\n- Some opposing special weapons, such as Triple Inkstrike or Booyah Bomb, can defuse any Suction Bombs they touch, so hold off throwing them until after the special weapon finishes.\n\n- Any opponents caught within the Suction Bomb's explosion will get damaged or splatted.[24]\n\n- The Splattershot works well with many weapon classes. For example, the Splattershot's Trizooka works well with the Wave Breaker because the Wave Breaker locates opponents, so E-liter would be a good choice with the Splattershot; or any other weapon as useful.\n\nWhen it comes to the Splattershot, striking first is critical. Because of its high firing speed up close it will splat you in under half a second. Having a a quick Splat bomb before you strike can help in many cases. Also, attacking from a higher point to avoid them seeing you, then pointing your spray of ink towards their feet helps prevent them from moving you you can splat them with ease. For players with a roller or brush, focus on getting behind lines to give them little time to react and turn around. For chargers make sure you always know were they are and make sure they don't get behind you\n\nSome gear abilities that work well with the Splattershot are Comeback, Swim Speed Up, Special Charge Up, Intensify Action Up, Quick Super Jump, Quick Respawn, and Stealth Jump.\n\nThe Splattershot was projected to be a strong weapon, even before the game's release.[25] It has an aggressive kit that echoes that of the ubiquitous Tentatek Splattershot in the first Splatoon, while also presumably carrying over the many buffs it received in Splatoon 2. At first it seemed to be a correct prediction from the competitive community and the Splattershot remained a popular pick in tournaments; some players, such as Chara, considered the Splattershot to be the best weapon in the game at one point.[26] Trizooka was considered one of the best specials in the game at the time due to being good for both displacement and splatting opponents, even hitting opponents hiding behind cover if angled correctly.\n\nAs the meta of the Drizzle Season 2022 progressed however, the Splattershot began falling off in favor of the Splash-o-matic. Some players considered Trizooka to be more unreliable (in part thanks to its hitboxes, making getting splats with it occasionally inconsistent) and harder to use than the Splash-o-matic's Crab Tank, which applies pressure for a longer amount of time.[27]\n\nTrizooka received a buff in 4.1.0 that would buff its splash damage from 40 to 60, allowing it to splat opponents in two hits; this mitigated the special's consistency issue. Inkjet was also nerfed in the same patch, which had become the dominant special weapon at the time. Its main user was the Ballpoint Splatling, which also saw a points for special nerf to 210p. Players began to gravitate to Trizooka as an entry special, and as such Splattershot began to see a rise in usage. This was due to many reasons, such as its versatility, good movement, and most notably its ability to spam Trizooka. Splattershot was only 190p at the time, but was nerfed to 200p in 6.1.0 and 210p in 7.2.0. However, the weapon is still seeing usage, with players comparing it to the Kensa Splattershot in Splatoon 2, being a jack of all trades that can spam its special.\n\nPlayers have expressed frustration with the current metagame, with Trizooka being able to quickly swing a match due to its low startup time causing seemingly unreactable deaths. On the other hand, its one-shot can still be inconsistent due to the way the shots work,[28] which makes the special feel random to fight. This necessitates the usage of Tacticooler and most notably the Snipewriter 5H to reduce the special's impact - but Tacticooler's Special Saver means more Trizookas, since most teams will run a Splattershot for their main Trizooka and a secondary Trizooka weapon, such as a Squeezer, Tenta Sorella Brella, or Sloshing Machine Neo. Splattercolor Screen is being considered as a counter due to it blocking sightlines, but current issues with the special's design and how it impacts and physically harms disabled players means that Screen is often banned in tournaments and sees little use. As such, weapon bans are being discussed and experimented with again, whether it be banning more than one Trizooka or banning Splattershot outright.\n\nIn the 9.2.0 upadate, Splattershot received a shot speed and range buff. While not completely changing the weapon, this buff allowed Splattershot players to kill faster while also allowing them to do so from farther distances. The change is still being experimented with, but has come up with good results for the weapon, while not making it unhealthy, and resolidifying its spot as one of the best competitive mid-range shooters."
