The weapon plays similarly to the Deco kit in Splatoon 2 but with a Booyah Bomb allowing more versatility for the user.\n\nThe Glooga Dualies high damage and threatening two shot allows the weapon to play in a slayer role:\n\n- Being a dualie, the Glooga Dualies possess the ability to dodge roll.\nThe dodge rolls are at a similar speed to those of the Splat Dualies. While the dodge rolls are not slow, they are not fast either, and should not be used without thought.\nAfter rolling, there is a long endlag where the player will be immobile for 42 frames, which can leave the user exposed to close-up enemies.\nWhile in turret mode, the Glooga Dualies' range and damage are both increased, with the damage being able to splat opponents in two hits compared to the usual three.\nWith their long endlag and higher damage and range in turret mode, the Glooga Dualies' dodge rolls should not so much be used to avoid enemy fire, but instead to give themselves distance and splat opponents.\n\n- The dodge rolls are at a similar speed to those of the Splat Dualies.

Be careful with dodge rolls to avoid being splatted by opponents.\nThe Glooga Dualies' turfing capability is mediocre, making it difficult for the weapon to turf. Be careful of enemy ink to avoid getting trapped in it.\nTheir fire rate is slower than most other weapons. Keep a fair distance from most shorter ranged, faster fire rate opponents.\n\n- Their slow dodge rolls and long endlag will often leave the user exposed.

Keep a fair distance from most shorter ranged, faster fire rate opponents.\n\nWhen placed properly, a Splash Wall can provide great utility, even in stages and areas that are more open:\n\n- Any bombs thrown by an opponent that hit a Splash Wall will instantly explode, potentially splatting the Splash Wall's user or their teammates.\nRefrain from either showering in or rushing through the wall until it is certain that the other team has no bombs available in the area.\nDo not throw a Splash Wall behind a teammate unless you know there's no threat of opponent bombs, as a bomb thrown into the wall can instantly splat them.\n\n- Refrain from either showering in or rushing through the wall until it is certain that the other team has no bombs available in the area.\n\n- Do not throw a Splash Wall behind a teammate unless you know there's no threat of opponent bombs, as a bomb thrown into the wall can instantly splat them.\n\n- Defensively, a Splash Wall can allow its user to evade a pursuing opponent[1] or hinder the opponents' push, blocking both their movement and their fire.\n\n- Offensively, a Splash Wall can restrain the opponents' movement, allowing its user and their teammates to push forward or gain map control.\n\n- Throwing a Splash Wall behind an opponent can prevent them from fleeing from a fight, which can be particularly effective if they're low on ink.[2]\n\n- A Splash Wall can nullify a brella shield â€” even a Tenta Brella shield.\nIf an opposing brella user launches their shield, dropping a Splash Wall in front of it will cause both to negate one another, potentially denying a Rainmaker or Power Clam push.\nAt maximum, it takes 36-41% of the ink tank to launch a brella shield and 60% to drop a Splash Wall. However, the Splash Wall can be deployed far more quickly, allowing its user more time to reload ink or reposition themselves to a more favorable location.\n\n- If an opposing brella user launches their shield, dropping a Splash Wall in front of it will cause both to negate one another, potentially denying a Rainmaker or Power Clam push.\n\n- At maximum, it takes 36-41% of the ink tank to launch a brella shield and 60% to drop a Splash Wall. However, the Splash Wall can be deployed far more quickly, allowing its user more time to reload ink or reposition themselves to a more favorable location.\n\n- In Splatoon 3, the Tower will destroy any Splash Wall it collides into. However, a Splash Wall may be placed onto the Tower to protect its user or their teammate while riding it. (Once again, watch out for the opponents' bombs.)\n\n- Refrain from either showering in or rushing through the wall until it is certain that the other team has no bombs available in the area.\n\n- Do not throw a Splash Wall behind a teammate unless you know there's no threat of opponent bombs, as a bomb thrown into the wall can instantly splat them.\n\n- If an opposing brella user launches their shield, dropping a Splash Wall in front of it will cause both to negate one another, potentially denying a Rainmaker or Power Clam push.\n\n- At maximum, it takes 36-41% of the ink tank to launch a brella shield and 60% to drop a Splash Wall. However, the Splash Wall can be deployed far more quickly, allowing its user more time to reload ink or reposition themselves to a more favorable location.\n\nThe Booyah Bomb can either turn the tide of a battle or fully tilt it in its user's team's favor, but only if used properly.\n\n- In general, activate the Booyah Bomb in a relatively safe place, as even an opposing Aerospray user within range can break the Booyah Bomb armor.\n\n- The Booyah Bomb can force opponents â€“ particularly anchors â€“ to move out of position or delay an opponent's offensive push.\n\n- The explosion of the Booyah Bomb often places enough ink to uncap most Splat Zones and single-handedly capture some smaller Splat Zones.\nSometimes, a Booyah Bomb cannot fully capture or uncap a zone. There may also be two separate Splat Zones. Coordinating with teammates and their specials, such as Triple Inkstrike or Crab Tank, can better ensure capturing a zone or two.\n\n- Sometimes, a Booyah Bomb cannot fully capture or uncap a zone. There may also be two separate Splat Zones. Coordinating with teammates and their specials, such as Triple Inkstrike or Crab Tank, can better ensure capturing a zone or two.\n\n- When deployed, the Booyah Bomb is capable of protecting oneself and one's teammates from attacks - including bombs - and clearing an area of opponents, whether forcing them to flee or splatting them outright.\nBecause the Booyah Bomb can nullify an opponent's bombs, it serves as a great counter to opponent's bombs, particularly when maintaining control over a zone.\nWhen aimed at the Tower in Tower Control, a Booyah Bomb covers a large area around its point of detonation for a brief amount of time, as opposed to a Triple Inkstrike, which covers an multiple areas for a longer period, There are situations where a Booyah Bomb is preferable over Triple Inkstrike in stopping or slowing down the Tower and others where a Triple Inkstrike is more effective.\n\n- Because the Booyah Bomb can nullify an opponent's bombs, it serves as a great counter to opponent's bombs, particularly when maintaining control over a zone.\n\n- When aimed at the Tower in Tower Control, a Booyah Bomb covers a large area around its point of detonation for a brief amount of time, as opposed to a Triple Inkstrike, which covers an multiple areas for a longer period, There are situations where a Booyah Bomb is preferable over Triple Inkstrike in stopping or slowing down the Tower and others where a Triple Inkstrike is more effective.\n\n- Since special weapons are also free ink tank refills, a Glooga Dualies user can use its Booyah Bomb to stay alive and throw down another Splash Wall after throwing the Booyah Bomb, keeping up the pressure for a longer amount of time. Due to the weapon's solid turfing, a Glooga Dualies user will often have a Booyah Bomb at their disposal.\n\n- Sometimes, a Booyah Bomb cannot fully capture or uncap a zone. There may also be two separate Splat Zones. Coordinating with teammates and their specials, such as Triple Inkstrike or Crab Tank, can better ensure capturing a zone or two.\n\n- Because the Booyah Bomb can nullify an opponent's bombs, it serves as a great counter to opponent's bombs, particularly when maintaining control over a zone.\n\n- When aimed at the Tower in Tower Control, a Booyah Bomb covers a large area around its point of detonation for a brief amount of time, as opposed to a Triple Inkstrike, which covers an multiple areas for a longer period, There are situations where a Booyah Bomb is preferable over Triple Inkstrike in stopping or slowing down the Tower and others where a Triple Inkstrike is more effective.\n\nBecause the Glooga Dualies are generally poor at turfing, their users will have to rely on their teammates to maintain map control. Not having enough turfing ability presents its own set of problems:[3]\n\n- A team whose composition lacks enough turfing ability can be rendered immobile if the other team dominates map control.\n\n- A lack of turfing also makes it difficult to alter the course of a game, even after wiping out the other team.\n\nWhile the Glooga Dualies' Splash Wall benefits the user significantly, it is not a lethal bomb. Lack of lethal bombs â€“ particularly either Splat or Suction Bombs â€“ generally necessitates its user's teammates to equip weapons that include them. Lethal bombs provide their user's team a couple advantages over another team that has no lethal bombs in its composition:\n\n- Their one-hit-splat offers its user's team chances of instantly gaining a numbers advantage, from which a game-winning push can arise.\n\n- Their lethal explosion provides space for its user's team to either push into an area held by the opponent or stall an opponent's push.\n\nWhile Booyah Bomb is capable of both splatting opponents and turfing surfaces it comes in contact with, it is not necessarily the best special weapon at either task. Therefore, it is advised to have other special weapons available to fill those specific roles whenever necessary, as having too many users of Booyah Bomb in a team composition will limit a team's arsenal of weapons:[3]\n\n- Due to their longer duration, faster firing rate, and easier means of aiming, Inkjet and Crab Tank are more capable of targeting and splatting opponents than is Booyah Bomb, which is better suited for displacing opponents for a brief amount of time.\n\n- Triple Inkstrike and Wave Breaker can drive away opponents longer from a contested area than Booyah Bomb can.\n\n- The Glooga Dualies is a formidable foe for most other weapons, due to its range and damage output. Therefore, most other weapons cannot easily defeat it in a straight one-on-one matchup and must use other means to defeat it.\nA matchup between two opposing Glooga Dualies wielders will depend on skill, positioning, turf control, and the presence of any supporting players.\nTo engage a Glooga Dualies with a shorter range weapon, try to catch it off guard through either careful flanking or sharking, better positioning, or wise use of bombs. Do not forget that the Glooga Dualies also has Splash Walls as well.\nThe Splat Brella can decently counter the Glooga Dualies due to the durability of their shields. The Tenta Brella are more damaging and provide more protection, provided that their shields are opened early enough. The Undercover Brella, however, are too weak to match the Glooga Dualies' damage, and their shields are not sturdy enough to provide sufficient protection.\nTry to take advantage of the Glooga Dualies' relative inability to turf by containing it with ink. This might require the use of sub weapons and teammates.\nA few weapons that either match or exceed the range of the Glooga Dualies without sacrificing mobility can defeat one head-on. For example, the .96 Gal overpower and slightly outrange the Glooga Dualies, while the Squeezer's burst fire mode outrange it. The Dualie Squelchers match the Glooga Dualies' range and can outmaneuver it with dodge rolling and with roll jumping.\n\n- A matchup between two opposing Glooga Dualies wielders will depend on skill, positioning, turf control, and the presence of any supporting players.\n\n- To engage a Glooga Dualies with a shorter range weapon, try to catch it off guard through either careful flanking or sharking, better positioning, or wise use of bombs.

Chargers can also predict where a Glooga Dualies user will be after a roll and splat them before they can fire. This can especially be taken advantage of because of the Glooga Dualies' long endlag. However, once the Glooga Dualies gets close, it can outmaneuver and outdraw its less mobile, slower firing opponent.\n\n- A matchup between two opposing Glooga Dualies wielders will depend on skill, positioning, turf control, and the presence of any supporting players.\n\n- To engage a Glooga Dualies with a shorter range weapon, try to catch it off guard through either careful flanking or sharking, better positioning, or wise use of bombs.

Because of their heavy reliance on Splash Wall, this ability is highly recommended if your team is expecting to face one.\nLethal bombs are generally the most efficient means to damage and destroy opposing Splash Walls. Their explosions can also splat opponents who either stay too close to the Splash Wall or attempt to rush through it.\nIf bombs are unavailable, rapidly-firing shooters and some quicker-charging splatlings are more effective at destroying an opponent's Splash Wall than slower-firing weapons, such as blasters and sloshers.\nIf wielding a brella, refrain from launching the shield at an opposing Splash Wall user unless it is to clear out a planted Splash Wall.\nAn Ultra Stamp will easily destroy a Splash Wall, breaking through any chokepoints the opponent may be defending. The Ultra Stamp wielder can then proceed to splat or chase out opponents while teammates follow behind to either mount or continue a push.\n\n- Object Shredder multiplies damage inflicted onto an opposing Glooga Dualies user's Splash Wall by 125%.

Use this opportunity to locate, call out, and â€“ if possible â€“ splat any active opponents who are powering up their teammate's Booyah Bomb.\nA Booyah Bomb turfs surfaces starting from the center before spreading out. If your weapon has the range to maintain a safe distance from the explosion of an opponent's Booyah Bomb, it is possible to maintain possession of a Splat Zone by turfing the center of where the Bomb landed.\n\n- If they activate a Booyah Bomb in an unsafe position, try attacking them, particularly with bombs and chargers.\n\n- A Triple Inkstrike can destroy and splat a user using only one strike.\n\n- An opposing Crab Tank can destroy a Booyah Bomb if it can get to its fastest fire rate before the Booyah Bomb user finishes charging.\n\n- Whenever an opposing Glooga Dualies user charges a Booyah Bomb, any of their teammates â€“ whether active or splatted â€“ who help in powering up the special might expose their positions.

This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.\n\nLast-Ditch Effort is a headgear-exclusive ability that, under specific conditions, grants its user 1 to 24 ability points each of the following abilities:\n\n- Ink Saver (Main)\n\n- Ink Saver (Sub)\n\n- Ink Recovery Up\n\nThese abilities only begin to take effect under either of the following conditions:\n\n- There are at most 30 seconds remaining on the game clock, or Overtime has begun in a Ranked Battle, at which the maximum 24 ability points will be granted for each of the above abilities.\n\n- In a Ranked Battle, the opposing team's countdown has at most 50 points remaining. The effects of Last-Ditch Effort increase as the opposing team's countdown decreases from 50 to 30 points remaining, starting with 1 ability point for each ability and maxing out to 24 ability points.\n\nThe Glooga Dualies consumes ink rapidly and Splash Walls take 60% of the ink tank. A Glooga Dualies user will benefit most from Last-Ditch Effort to allow the user to attack safely more often and to reduce the chance of being caught without ink.\n\nQuick Respawn shortens respawn time after getting splatted (under specific conditions), encouraging a Glooga Dualies user to remain aggressive even after getting splatted.\n\n- 16 ability points â€“ one main and two subs â€“ are enough to reduce the respawn time from 8.5 seconds to 6.67 seconds.\n\n- 26 ability points â€“ two mains and two subs â€“ is enough to reduce the respawn time from 8.5 seconds to 5.8 seconds.[4]\n\nSpecial Charge Up accelerates building up the special gauge for Booyah Bomb, allowing for more survivability or displacement.\n\n- Just six ability points, or two subs, are enough to reduce the special gauge requirement from 180p to 171p.\n\nSuper Jumping to a teammate after respawning carries the risk of getting splatted upon landing, due to the appearance of a Super Jump indicator. When equipped, Stealth Jump better covers this indicator from long-distance opponents, allowing its user to more safely return to the front lines and maintain pressure on the opponent."
