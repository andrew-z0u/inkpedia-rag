    "The Luna Blaster is a blaster-type weapon with a very short range, but a large blast size, high damage, and a decent rate of fire. In Splatoon, its loadout includes Ink Mine and Inkzooka.",
    "The weapon can be used as an aggressive weapon, against other close-range weapons and occasionally against long-range weapons thanks to the Inkzooka.",
    "The Luna Blaster is effective in close combat, thanks to its large explosions and higher rate of fire than a standard Blaster. However, its range is short (being the shortest in the game with the Inkbrush), forcing many to get close to the opponent, similar to a Sploosh-o-matic.\nIf the target is too far away, using the Inkzooka can be optimal, compensating for the very short range of the main weapon. However, this special weapon is fixed at 220p to be able to use it, so the Luna Blaster only gets a little of it.\nThe Ink Mine is rarely useful with this weapon. Only one can be placed at a time and it automatically explodes after a certain amount of time. It is therefore rarely used extensively. However, it can be placed in a strategic location, such as the Rainmaker arrival base.",
    "Since the weapon has a very short range, no lethal bombs or other throwing sub weapon, and only gets a few Inkzooka due to suboptimal inking capacity because of the range, it can be easy to counter. Use a weapon with more range while keeping a minimum distance from the enemy Luna Blaster to be able to damage it without putting yourself in danger. Just be wary of the Inkzooka in case the opponent has one ready.",
    "TBA.",
    "The Luna Blaster returns in Splatoon 2. Its loadout contains Splat Bomb and Baller. The weapon received some changes in this game as can be seen in its version history.\nIt initially received reductions in the width of its explosions, its damage, and an increase in its ink consumption, but subsequently received improvements to these same characteristics, as well as other slight modifications making the weapon slightly more effective against certain targets (like the brella's shields) and having a better inking capacity.",
    "The Luna Blaster may be more versatile in Splatoon 2 compared to the previous game. The weapon can still be used aggressively, but it also includes a lethal bomb. Its kit may be reminiscent of the Luna Blaster Neo from the previous game. The lack of a ranged offensive capability is notable, however.",
    "The Luna Blaster retains its performance from the previous game, with a good blast size and rate of fire, at the cost of a short range. Its early game performance reductions have mostly been reversed or lightened. Improvements have also been made to enhance the weapon's synergy. Notably, since the 4.0.0 update, the weapon has been classified as lightweight, which improves its mobility.\nThe Splat Bomb can be useful for attacking an opponent slightly too far away to be reached with the main weapon, in addition to the many usual uses of this bomb, which is very versatile.\nThe Baller can be used to complement the main weapon's aggressive side: rush into combat and try to maximize damage.",
    "The Luna Blaster has a very limited range and consumes a lot of ink. Aim to deal damage from a distance, especially after the opponent throws a Splat Bomb, as they won't have much ink left to retaliate.",
    "The Luna Blaster is still available in Splatoon 3. Its loadout includes Splat Bomb and Zipcaster.\nThe weapon has received improvements over the updates to compensate for its very short range, such as an increase in accuracy, its blast hitbox, and its inking capacity.",
    "The Luna Blaster from Splatoon 3 is the most mobile in the series thanks to its kit.",
    "The main weapon remains particularly effective at close range with its blast radius and decent rate of fire. Since Version 7.2.0, the weapon inks the ground more effectively by about 20%. This helps trap the opponent in the ink to prevent them from fleeing. It can be useful to take the opponent by surprise to avoid confronting an opponent with a longer range directly and head-on, until the special weapon is ready to be used.\nThe Zipcaster allows you to target even the most distant enemies. This special weapon allows for many mobility actions, compensating for its short range. Note, however, that it is impossible to use the sub weapon while using the special weapon.\nLike in Splatoon 2, the Splat Bomb is still useful for attacking an opponent slightly too far away to be reached with the main weapon.",
    "With its kit, the weapon is very mobile overall. However, even when using Zipcaster, it is necessary to get as close as possible to the target to hit it with the main weapon's shots, similar to Carbon Roller. The special weapon's extendable arm can also deal damage, but it is necessary to aim very precisely to maximize the damage on the target.",
    "The Luna Blaster has a very limited range and consumes a lot of ink. Aim to deal damage from a distance, especially after the opponent throws a Splat Bomb, as they won't have much ink left to retaliate. Don't get too close to avoid getting caught in its ink, and keep an eye on the opponent's use of the Zipcaster so you don't get caught by surprise."
