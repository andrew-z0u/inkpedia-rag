    "As the second sub weapon introduced in Splatoon, the Burst Bomb is less powerful and less effective in zoning out opponents than the Splat Bomb. However, its instant detonation allows for quicker splats, more rapid turfing, and improved mobility, regardless of which main weapon it is paired with.",
    "Burst Bombs provide good utility but function differently from Splat or Suction Bombs:",
    "- They instantly explode upon contact with any surface – such as a wall or floor – or another player — whether a teammate or an opponent. This provides a few advantages over other bombs:\nThey can more quickly damage opponents, which makes them suitable for leading off attacks, breaking opponents' Ink Armor,[2] or finishing off injured opponents who attempt to flee. The Tri-Slosher and the Carbon Roller Deco have the best potential at burst canceling.\nThey effectively extend the range at which their user can quickly damage their opponents. Users of the Neo Splash-o-matic, along with the aforementioned Tri-Slosher and Carbon Roller Deco, benefit the most due to their short range, allowing them to poke at opponents from a safer distance.\nThey instantly turf inkable surfaces, permitting either a fast pursuit of an opponent or a rapid retreat from an unfavorable situation. This trait is particularly important for main weapons that either turf slowly or are relatively immobile (e.g., the Grim Range Blaster, with a mobility of 0.40 DU/f while firing, fits both categories), enabling their users to move more quickly than usual.\nBesides improving your team's mobility, Burst Bombs' quick turfing also restricts your opponents' mobility and reduces their sharking opportunities. This makes them particularly effective against opposing users of weapons that depend on map control to be effective – most rollers, Squiffers, and Nautiluses.[3][4] Also, any opponents hit by Burst Bombs will be surrounded by your team's ink, further limiting their health and mobility.",
    "- They require less ink than most bombs (40% of the ink tank per use without Ink Saver (Sub) versus 70% for Splat or Suction Bombs), which allows their user to more easily throw two consecutive Burst Bombs and makes them more readily available to pressure opponents during a push.",
    "- However, their resulting explosion is both weaker and smaller than those of Splat or Suction Bombs:[5]\nOnly direct hits will inflict the maximum 60 HP of damage. Always go for direct hits whenever possible.\nTargets within 32 DU of a Burst Bomb's explosion – just shy of two-thirds of a distance line away in the test range – will receive 35 HP of damage.\nTargets between 32 DU and 40 DU – equal to the lethal blast radius of Splat Bombs – will receive only 25 HP of damage.\nAs a result of these drawbacks and their instant detonation, Burst Bombs are less effective at zoning and area denial than are most other bombs.",
    "- Although less powerful than other bombs, a Burst Bomb can still damage or even destroy an opponent's brella shield, Splash Wall, or Baller or the Rainmaker shield, while detonating on contact.\nAny opponents caught within the Burst Bomb's explosion will get damaged or splatted.[6]\nIt will also inflate or pop a teammate's bubbles but deflate or diffuse an opponent's bubbles, while still detonating on contact.[7]",
    "- An opponent's Splashdown, Booyah Bomb, or Ultra Stamp will defuse any Splat Bombs it touches, so hold off using them until after their special weapon finishes.",
    "- Using any special weapon also provides a free ink tank refill. Therefore, a Tri-Slosher user can throw Burst Bombs before and after activating Ink Armor.",
    "While the Burst Bomb is a versatile sub weapon, they lack certain advantages offered by lethal bombs — particularly either Splat or Suction Bombs, which provide their user's team many advantages over another team that has no lethal bombs in its composition.[8] Burst bombs lack the one-hit-splat that would offers its user's team chances of instantly gaining a numbers advantage, from which a game-winning push can arise. Its instant detonation generates less space for its user's team to either push into an area held by the opponent or stall an opponent's push. However, like lethal bombs, the turf inked by the resulting explosion still contributes to both maintaining map control and building up the special gauge.",
    "Although less powerful than traditional bombs, Burst Bombs can still allow their user – especially one whose main weapon lacks either range or damage – to provide support for any teammate:",
    "- If using a short-ranged main weapon, cooperate with the teammate using primarily Burst Bombs when engaging an opponent: attack from different angles, or force the opponent to come within range of the teammate's weapon.",
    "- When using a longer-ranged weapon–especially a very long-ranged weapon, such as a Custom Jet Squelcher–use your main weapon more often than Burst Bombs for support fire. However, do not overlook opportunities to use Burst Bombs, such as adding chip damage to an already weakened opponent.",
    "- Do not forget the Burst Bombs' ability to instantly turf surfaces. If a teammate is surrounded by opposing turf, tossing a Burst Bomb or two in their area can give them either a potential escape route or another direction from which to attack their opponents.",
    "- If your teammate gets splatted and an opponent is still present, then determine whether you can easily finish them off. If your weapon is either too weak or too short-ranged or if the opponent either is too healthy or has a teammate, then strongly consider retreating instead of risking getting splatted.",
    "- Both Bomb Defense Up DX and Ink Resistance Up – already valuable utility abilities – provide various measures of protection against Burst Bombs. Just three ability points, or one sub, of each ability offer good utility:[9][10][11][12]\nBomb Defense Up DX reduces the amount of damage taken from both direct hits and splash damage by Burst Bombs.\nInk Resistance Up not only partially offsets the reduction in mobility but also delays the passive damage taken from opposing ink resulting from being hit by a Burst Bomb.",
    "[13]",
    "- Be aware of your opponents' locations before using a brella shield, Splash Wall, Baller, or Bubble Blower, as an opponent's Burst Bombs will detonate upon impact with any of these, damaging or even splatting you or your teammates if caught within their blast.",
    "- Remember that Burst Bombs can extend the effective range of opponents wielding shorter-ranged main weapons – especially the Tri-Slosher and the Carbon Roller Deco – and remain out of their throwing range to avoid getting splatted by their burst cancel.",
    "- Certain special weapons – such as Splashdown, Booyah Bomb, and Ultra Stamp – can negate any of the opponents' Burst Bombs."
