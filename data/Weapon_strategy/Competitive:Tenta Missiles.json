  "content": "Tenta Missiles is a global special, capable of locating and targeting multiple opponents as well as the Rainmaker.[3] While it only needs a simple amount of input, it requires understanding and experience to use to its full potential. It is available early in Splatoon 2 on a variety of weapons, from slayer's weapons to anchor's weapons, but its global characteristics make it primarily a supportive special weapon.\n\nTenta Missiles can be used to pressure opponents and force them out of position without having to commit too far forward:[2]\n\n- It is recommended to only activate the Tenta Missiles at a safe distance from opponents, not only because a Tenta Missile user is vulnerable to close-range attacks but also because opponents who are further back are easier to track and home missiles on.\n\n- After activating the Tenta Missiles, use its tracking phase as a pseudo-Echolocator to determine the opponents' locations and maximize the number of targets.\n\n- The number of missiles launched – and the amount of time needed to fire them – and the number of missiles launched towards each target depends on how many targets – opponents and the Rainmaker – were locked on upon launching:\nOne targets: ten missiles\nTwo targets: five missiles each\nThree to five targets: four missiles each, firing time increasing as number of targets increases\n\n- One targets: ten missiles\n\n- Two targets: five missiles each\n\n- Three to five targets: four missiles each, firing time increasing as number of targets increases\n\n- Try firing Tenta Missiles at opponents near or on the tower to drive opponents away from the tower. It is more effective if fired on one person if they are alone.\n\n- Sometimes, it may be more beneficial to target a specific opponent or two instead of all of them, based on their weapons, location, and situation:[3]\nOpponents wielding heavy, slow firing weapons will have a harder time escaping the missiles.\nOpponents who are bunched together are more likely to cause their teammates to receive collateral damage than those who are spread apart.\nTenta Missiles are also a reliable means of forcing opposing anchors to cede their ground and lose focus while aiming. Sometimes, this is the only reliable means to push back into a zone or another important area of the stage.\nTenta Missiles can counter an opponent's Sting Ray or Booyah Bomb if anticipated early enough; an opponent will be forced to either delay or interrupt it to avoid getting splatted by the missiles, throwing off their aim.[4]\n\n- Opponents wielding heavy, slow firing weapons will have a harder time escaping the missiles.\n\n- Opponents who are bunched together are more likely to cause their teammates to receive collateral damage than those who are spread apart.\n\n- Tenta Missiles are also a reliable means of forcing opposing anchors to cede their ground and lose focus while aiming.

However, there are a few steps to minimize their impact:[6]\n\n- Bomb Defense Up DX, which already provides useful protection against Bomb splash damage, also reduces the damage taken from certain special weapons, including Tenta Missiles.[7][8] Just three ability points, or one sub,…\n…reduce their far splash damage to 29.0.\n…reduce their near splash damage to 48.3, allowing one to survive two near misses.[1]\n\n- …reduce their far splash damage to 29.0.\n\n- …reduce their near splash damage to 48.3, allowing one to survive two near misses.[1]\n\n- Before the battle begins, pay attention to the opposing team's composition to check how many and which opponents have Tenta Missiles.\n\n- Be mindful of both when the opponent has Tenta Missiles ready and when the missiles are launched:\nIf an opponent attempts to launch them when nearby you, splat them quickly to reduce or even cancel their deployment.\nAvoid cluttered formations and maintain enough distance from your teammates to prevent collateral Tenta Missile damage whenever the opponent deploys their Missiles.[9]\nIf your team is in possession of the Splat Zone(s), then avoid hanging around them when opposing missiles are deployed to prevent the opponents from uncapping it.\nWhenever targeted by opposing Tenta Missiles, unless actively engaging an opponent, only move enough to avoid damage and reduce the amount of turfing by the Missiles.[10]\nTake advantage of any natural cover available on the stage, such as trees, roofs, overhangs, and catwalks. Glass is even better, as it can't be turfed.\nSuper Jumping to a teammate, a Squid Beakon, or your spawn point can also help elude missiles, as long as the landing is a safe place.\n\n- If an opponent attempts to launch them when nearby you, splat them quickly to reduce or even cancel their deployment.\n\n- Avoid cluttered formations and maintain enough distance from your teammates to prevent collateral Tenta Missile damage whenever the opponent deploys their Missiles.[9]\n\n- If your team is in possession of the Splat Zone(s), then avoid hanging around them when opposing missiles are deployed to prevent the opponents from uncapping it.\n\n- Whenever targeted by opposing Tenta Missiles, unless actively engaging an opponent, only move enough to avoid damage and reduce the amount of turfing by the Missiles.[10]\n\n- Take advantage of any natural cover available on the stage, such as trees, roofs, overhangs, and catwalks.

Many updates have been made to nerf the special. Explosion damage is now less widespread and a 10-second cooldown has been introduced."
