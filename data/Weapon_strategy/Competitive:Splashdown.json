  "content": "Splashdown is an offensive special typically paired with slayer weapons, sending the user into the air before crashing down with an explosion. This is more of a \"selfish\" special designed to benefit the user more than their team, allowing them to inflict damage on their opponents to either soften them up for a final blow, or splat the opponent outright.\n\nThe Splashdown can turn the tide of battle, but needs to be used with care as it is easy to cancel.\n\n- Be careful when using this special, as competent opponents can shoot you out the air before you attack. In general, avoid \"panicking\" the Splashdown, or using it in response to being shot at by surprise.\n\n- A player performing a normal Splashdown is invincible both during the first five frames, or 0.083 seconds, and upon landing for 30 frames, or 0.5 seconds, but is vulnerable to attack during the rest of the special. Opponents will have this brief window of vulnerability to attack the player performing Splashdown – with ranged weapons, bombs (if thrown in advance), and some special weapons.\nThe further an opponent is from a player performing a normal Splashdown, the easier it is for the former to adjust their aim upward to splat the latter[2] and the less likely they will take significant damage (see below).\nStarting from Version 4.1.0, a player who is splatted in the middle of attempting to perform Splashdown will only suffer a special gauge reduction of 25% (with no Special Saver). However, if splatted by an opponent equipped with either Haunt (when active) or Respawn Punisher, then the special gauge penalty is 40%.\nTherefore, if you intend to use Splashdown within the range of an opponent, generally do so when close to them.\n\n- The further an opponent is from a player performing a normal Splashdown, the easier it is for the former to adjust their aim upward to splat the latter[2] and the less likely they will take significant damage (see below).\n\n- Starting from Version 4.1.0, a player who is splatted in the middle of attempting to perform Splashdown will only suffer a special gauge reduction of 25% (with no Special Saver).

The higher Splashdown is activated, the wider the lethal splash radius. This also has the benefit of making it harder to be shot out the air.\nTargets that are just outside the splash radius – up to about 100 DU from the center – receive 70 damage, while those that are even further – about 145 DU – receive 55 damage as of Version 1.3.0. These distances are not affected by the height at which Splashdown is activated.\nIn addition, opponents that survive the Splashdown might suffer knockback, especially if they are either wearing Ink Armor or using Baller.\n\n- Targets within the lethal splash radius of about 70 DU – marked by a bright circle that appears as a player initiates Splashdown – receive 180 HP of damage, most likely splatting those not protected by Ink Armor, Baller, or Booyah Bomb armor.

While the former method is quicker, the latter provides the flexibility of holding onto Splashdown in case it is not needed.\nA player executing a Super Jumping Splashdown is invulnerable during its entire duration, making it fully safe if performed in this manner.\nWhile this can surprise and splat some opponents who attempt to camp the Super Jump marker, those who pay attention to the HUD will keep their distance from the marker. Super Jumping into Splashdown can still be used to push back the opponents and gain space for teammates.\n\n- A player executing a Super Jumping Splashdown is invulnerable during its entire duration, making it fully safe if performed in this manner.\n\n- While this can surprise and splat some opponents who attempt to camp the Super Jump marker, those who pay attention to the HUD will keep their distance from the marker. Super Jumping into Splashdown can still be used to push back the opponents and gain space for teammates.\n\n- Certain weapons can follow up easily after a successful Splashdown to finish off opponents, such as a Splattershot throwing Burst Bombs at the opponent, a .96 Gal Deco hitting the opponent once, or a Kensa Sloshing Machine using a mix of Fizzy Bombs or the main weapon.\n\n- Splashdown can be used to counter certain specials, such as Bubble Blower, Baller, Booyah Bomb,any Bomb Launcher, and in some cases, Ultra Stamp. When these specials come close to the Splashdown's explosion, they are typically instantly destroyed.\nBooyah Bomb armor will either be completely shattered or heavily damaged from a Splashdown; either way, it only takes a few more attacks from the main weapon to splat the opponent.\nA well-timed Splashdown can instantly splat an Ultra Stamp user, as long as it used before the Ultra Stamp user reaches the player using Splashdown. If it is activated too late, the Ultra Stamp will splat the user before they can reach the apex of the Splashdown.\n\n- Booyah Bomb armor will either be completely shattered or heavily damaged from a Splashdown; either way, it only takes a few more attacks from the main weapon to splat the opponent.\n\n- A well-timed Splashdown can instantly splat an Ultra Stamp user, as long as it used before the Ultra Stamp user reaches the player using Splashdown. If it is activated too late, the Ultra Stamp will splat the user before they can reach the apex of the Splashdown.\n\n- Using Splashdown on the objective in Ranked Modes can either delay an enemy push or give your team control:\nDue to the large explosion from the Splashdown, it can be used to cap a Splat Zone, or at least neutralize it. Coordinate with your teammates, particularly their own specials, to ensure the zone gets capped.\nSplashdowning on the Tower in Tower Control can secure possession of it, especially at a checkpoint.[3] However, take care not to use this when the Tower is over water or out of bounds; the Tower can move away and send you plummeting into the water or off the map.\nThe Rainmaker shield is instantly popped by a Splashdown.\n\n- Due to the large explosion from the Splashdown, it can be used to cap a Splat Zone, or at least neutralize it.

To prevent getting splatted out of the sky, try to activate it once you receive Ink Armor from a teammate, as that will prevent you from getting splatted while in the air.\n\nIn general, Splashdown has a difficult time finding its place in a team composition due to being seen as one of the weaker specials in the game.[1] Most weapons in competitive that have Splashdown, such as the Kensa Sloshing Machine, are ran in spite of having that special.\n\nThe specific weaknesses Splashdown has compared to other special weapons reduces its effectiveness if possessed by more than one player in a team:[4]\n\n- Without a teammate or Squid Beakon to Super Jump to, Splashdown is relatively static. It cannot push back opponents as effectively as Baller, Bomb Launcher, Booyah Bomb, or even Ink Storm can.\n\n- An opponent who is skilled at splatting Splashdown attempts could effectively neutralize the special weapon of anyone with Splashdown due to its mostly consistent height, duration, and pattern.\n\nIf you regularly keep track of your teammates' locations with the map (by pressing ), you might find opportune moments to use a Super Jumping Splashdown to secure control of important areas, such as onto the Tower or just underneath the opponents' clam basket.\n\n- Before the battle begins, pay attention to the opposing team's composition to check how many and which opponents have Splashdown.\n\n- Keep an eye on the HUD to know when the opponent has Splashdown ready to use, and be ready for activation when fighting that opponent.\n\n- If you have good aim, you can try to shoot the Splashdown out of the air to prevent getting damaged by it, or prevent your team's specials from getting destroyed.\nShort-ranged weapons, such as the Inkbrush or Sploosh-o-matic, or slower weapons, such as the Dynamo Roller or Explosher, will struggle to do so, in which case it is best to back off instead.\nTo practice aiming at Splashdowns, you can go into the test range and practice flicking your aim upwards at the dummies on the grates.\n\n- Short-ranged weapons, such as the Inkbrush or Sploosh-o-matic, or slower weapons, such as the Dynamo Roller or Explosher, will struggle to do so, in which case it is best to back off instead.\n\n- To practice aiming at Splashdowns, you can go into the test range and practice flicking your aim upwards at the dummies on the grates.\n\n- Watch out for any suspicious Super Jump markers. If a Super Jump marker appears in a risky spot, such as on the front lines, it is likely that the opponent is attempting to use a Splashdown mid-Super Jump. Instead of camping it with your main weapon, toss a bomb over to the marker instead if you have one.\n\n- If you are in a Baller and the opponent uses Splashdown, you can begin detonation to prevent the Baller from getting destroyed. If timed properly, you can even explode right as the opponent finishes the Splashdown, splatting them instead.\nBaller also can be used as last resort if underneath a Splashdown about to land, as the Baller will prevent all damage done to you. The downside of this is that the Baller is instantly destroyed, preventing you from using it to splat the Splashdowning player.\n\n- Baller also can be used as last resort if underneath a Splashdown about to land, as the Baller will prevent all damage done to you.

The downside of this is that the Baller is instantly destroyed, preventing you from using it to splat the Splashdowning player.\n\nIn Salmon Run, Splashdown can be used to instantly take out multiple Boss Salmonids at once. It can also be used as a panic button if a player is left the only one alive.\n\n- A Splashdown can instantly take out all Boss Salmonids, except for Flyfish, Scrapper (If it's facing the player), Griller (If it is not stunned), and Maws (If it is swimming)\nOf course, the Splashdown must be in range.\n\n- Of course, the Splashdown must be in range.\n\n- It is advised not to use any Special Weapon in Salmon Run for any lesser Salmonid (Chum, Smallfry, Cohock) unless it is used for an emergency, such as being completely surrounded.\n\n- Of course, the Splashdown must be in range."
