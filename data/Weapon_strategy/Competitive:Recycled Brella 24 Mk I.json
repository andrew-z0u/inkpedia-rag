    "The Recycled Brella 24 Mk I is a new weapon in the brella class in Splatoon 3. It launches and regenerates its canopy quickly, more than other weapons in its class. However, its durability is very low. This, along with its high damage and low shot spread leads the weapon towards a slayer play-style.",
    "- The main appeal of the Recycled Brella 24 is its high damage and more consistent damage compared to the Splat Brella.[1][2]",
    "- It is possible to follow the shield after being launched, much like the Tenta Brella, but this type of play is more situational, as the shield moves quicker and is weaker.[1][2]",
    "- Its canopy is best used as a mobility tool, similar to a Curling Bomb. It can be used to allow it to set up its Big Bubbler in an important part of the stage, engage an enemy, or provide an escape.[1][2]\nThe canopy can also be used to fake or conceal an approach, which can confuse an opponent.[1][2]",
    "- Hitting an opponent directly with an Angle Shooter then following up with the main weapon is faster than firing the weapon twice. However, this uses more ink.[2]",
    "- Big Bubbler can be used to make up for the bad shield durability, or used when if your getting attacked while the canopy is broken.",
    "- The fast shield launch and low durability means any sort of constant shooting is a viable way to splat a Recycled Brella 24 Mk I user.",
    "- Using a bomb like Splat Bomb or Suction Bomb will shred the shield almost immediately, leaving the user vulnerable for about two seconds.",
    "- Luring the user into an area covered in your ink allows you to quickly swim around them to either dodge their shots or get behind their shield.",
    "Gear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.",
    "Run Speed Up is decently useful on all brellas.",
    "Usually aggressive weapons should have some Swim Speed Up, but the base swimming speed is faster than the speed of the launched canopy. Not really needed if you have Comeback.",
    "Normal utility subs for most weapons, only one sub is recommended.",
    "Running some Special Charge Up will also help you not get splatted as much, due to the special being Big Bubbler.",
    "Because Recycled Brella 24 Mk I is a slayer and can't turf that well, one or two subs of Special Saver can be useful for getting your Big Bubbler more often.",
    "The Recycled Brella 24 user is likely to get splatted a lot due to its play-style, which Quick Respawn can mitigate.[1]",
    "Comeback and Stealth Jump are both essential abilities for any aggressive front-line weapon.[1]",
    "The Recycled Brella 24 Mk I is unlikely to see use in competitive play due to its poor kit synergy, weak canopy, and its likelihood to struggle against mid-ranged weapons. However, its splatting power has been recognized as one of its strengths.[1][2]"
