  "content": "Introduced in 4.1.0, the Booyah Bomb is a new special with an effect similar to that of Inkstrike back in Splatoon, albeit with a different means of execution: a giant explosion of ink that turfs a large portion of the stage, diffuses opposing sub weapons and bubbles, and rapidly damages and splats any opponents caught within its blast. Unique from other specials is the ability for teammates to help its user charge the special to hasten its launch.\n\nThe Booyah Bomb can either turn the tide of a battle or fully tilt it in its user's team's favor, but only if used properly.\n\n- In general, activate the Booyah Bomb in a relatively safe place, as even an opposing Aerospray user within range can break the Booyah Bomb armor.\n\n- The Booyah Bomb can force opponents – particularly anchors – to move out of position or delay an opponent's offensive push.\n\n- The explosion of the Booyah Bomb often places enough ink to uncap most Splat Zones and single-handedly capture smaller Zones.\nSometimes, a Booyah Bomb cannot fully capture or uncap a zone. There may also be two separate Splat Zones. Coordinating with teammates and their specials, such as Bomb Launcher and Baller, can better ensure capturing a zone or two.\n\n- Sometimes, a Booyah Bomb cannot fully capture or uncap a zone. There may also be two separate Splat Zones. Coordinating with teammates and their specials, such as Bomb Launcher and Baller, can better ensure capturing a zone or two.\n\n- When deployed, the Booyah Bomb is capable of protecting oneself and one's teammates from attacks - including bombs - and clearing an area of opponents, whether forcing them to flee or splatting them outright.\nBecause the Booyah Bomb can nullify an opponent's bombs, it serves as a great counter to an opponent's Bomb Launcher, particularly when maintaining control over a zone.\nWhen aimed at the Tower in Tower Control, a Booyah Bomb covers a large area around its point of detonation for a brief amount of time, as opposed to a Bomb Launcher, which covers an area with multiple bombs for a longer period, or a Sting Ray, which fires a narrow line for a more sustained period. There are situations where a Booyah Bomb is preferable over either a Bomb Launcher or a Sting Ray in stopping or slowing down the Tower and others where either a Bomb Launcher or a Sting Ray is more effective.\n\n- Because the Booyah Bomb can nullify an opponent's bombs, it serves as a great counter to an opponent's Bomb Launcher, particularly when maintaining control over a zone.\n\n- When aimed at the Tower in Tower Control, a Booyah Bomb covers a large area around its point of detonation for a brief amount of time, as opposed to a Bomb Launcher, which covers an area with multiple bombs for a longer period, or a Sting Ray, which fires a narrow line for a more sustained period.

Therefore, it is advised to have other special weapons available to fill those specific roles whenever necessary, as having too many users of Booyah Bomb in a team composition will limit a team's arsenal of weapons:[2]\n\n- Due to their longer duration, faster firing rate, and easier means of aiming, Inkjet and Sting Ray are more capable of targeting and splatting opponents than is Booyah Bomb, which is better suited for displacing opponents for a brief amount of time.\n\n- Bomb Launcher and Baller can drive away opponents longer from a contested area and turf more thoroughly than a Booyah Bomb, whose turfing can be nullified by opponents re-turfing over its point of impact.[3]\n\nLike other special weapons, Booyah Bomb benefits when it is used in conjunction with other special weapons. Depending on your team's available special weapons, you can use your Booyah Bomb during a push to complement whatever other special weapons are available:\n\n- Using Booyah Bomb to turf either one end of a large Splat Zone or one of two Splat Zones can make it easier for a teammate with either Bomb Launcher or Baller or a group of teammates protected by either Ink Armor or Bubble Blower to turf the other end or Zone.\n\n- Opponents already fleeing your teammate's Tenta Missiles become easier targets for your Booyah Bomb — or at least will have difficulty dodging both special weapons.\n\nThe Booyah Bomb is a unique special weapon that enables its user's teammates to directly assist in powering it up. However, there will be times when it is wiser to refrain from charging a teammate's Booyah Bomb, such as if you are…\n\n- …in the middle of a confrontation with an opponent.\n\n- …advanced into the opponents' territory (e.g., while either flanking or sharking) to avoid exposing your position to the opponent.\n\n- Only five weapons in Splatoon 2 – the Aerospray PG, the Kensa .52 Gal, the Kensa Splattershot Pro, the Kensa Dynamo Roller, and the Heavy Splatling Remix – have Booyah Bomb in their kits. If a user of at least one of these weapons is on the opposing team, then regularly watch the HUD to know when an opponent's Booyah Bomb is fully charged, and both watch and listen for when it is activated.\n\n- If an opponent activates a Booyah Bomb in an unsafe position, try attacking them, particularly with bombs and chargers.\n\n- Tenta Missiles can splat a Booyah Bomb user in three direct hits.\n\n- A Splashdown within range can severely damage Booyah Bomb armor if not destroy it outright.\n\n- Whenever an opponent charges a Booyah Bomb, any of their teammates – whether active or splatted – who help in powering up the special might expose their positions. Use this opportunity to locate, call out, and – if possible – splat any active opponents who are powering up their teammate's Booyah Bomb.\n\n- A Booyah Bomb turfs surfaces starting from the center before spreading out. If your weapon has the range to maintain a safe distance from the explosion of an opponent's Booyah Bomb, it is possible to maintain possession of a Splat Zone by turfing the center of where the Bomb landed.[3]\n\n- In Splatoon 3, Ultra Stamps can break a Booyah Bomb's barrier with only one hit, with enough coordination, a player using the Booyah Bomb could be splatted before the release of their special.\n\nThe Booyah Bomb is back in Splatoon 3.\nOver the course of updates, the special weapon has become slightly more effective, requiring fewer \"Booyahs\" to fully charge the ball, and having an extended explosion width."
