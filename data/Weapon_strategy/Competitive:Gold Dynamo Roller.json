    "Like the original Dynamo Roller, the Gold Dynamo Roller takes plenty of time and practice to learn and get acclimated to, due to its slow mobility and firing rate, but can be an intimidating and dominating force when fully mastered. Compared to the other two variants, its kit allows its user to maintain control of highly contested areas of a stage, such as a Splat Zone.",
    "While the turfing ability and kit of the Gold Dynamo Roller suggests it to be a support weapon, its long range allows it to find success as an anchor as well:",
    "Spacing and positioning are critical when wielding the Gold Dynamo Roller, so learn its various effective ranges for both the horizontal and vertical swings — the lethal range (the maximum range at which at least 100 HP of damage is inflicted), the two-hit range (the maximum range at which at least 50 HP of damage is delivered), and the maximum range:",
    "As already mentioned, the Gold Dynamo Roller has a few glaring drawbacks, including its aforementioned lack of mobility and slow fire rate:",
    "The Splat Bomb, a versatile sub weapon in many kits, is the Gold Dynamo Roller user's quickest option in close- to medium-ranged combat:",
    "Ink Armor enables its user's team to either initiate a push, to recapture a Splat Zone for example, or maintain one, such as while locking out the opponent.",
    "The Gold Dynamo Roller has great range and thorough turfing but is lacks mobility while moving or firing and has trouble leading pushes and pursuing opponents. Be sure to include some mobile, shorter-ranged weapons in the team composition. Otherwise, a team with too many longer-ranged weapons will have major drawbacks:[11]",
    "Multiple Ink Armors used by the same team do not stack. Therefore, it would be redundant for a team to have more than two Ink Armor users.[11]",
    "Gear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.",
    "Because bombs are a good countermeasure against an opposing Dynamo user, a Gold Dynamo Roller user can expect to have the opponents' bombs thrown their way. Ever since its introduction in version 4.3.0, Bomb Defense Up DX will not only reduce the damage taken from opposing sub and special weapons that are not one-hit-splat but will also reduce the duration of the tracking effects of certain opponent's sub and special weapons, such as Point Sensors and Ink Mines, allowing the user of this ability to evade detection more easily. Just three ability points, or one sub, offer plenty of utility:[12][13]",
    "Even though a Gold Dynamo Roller user generally keeps their distance from opponents, they can still expect to come in contact with opposing ink on various surfaces, particularly while swimming from one location to another. While in contact with the opponent's ink, Ink Resistance Up both delays the damage taken and partially offsets reduction in running speed and jumping height — including while swinging the weapon.[12][13][14]",
    "Reducing the Gold Dynamo Roller's high ink consumption allows its user to swing it more often before having to refill their ink tank. Not only can this be accomplished this with Ink Saver (Main), it is also one of nineteen weapons in Splatoon 2 that receives a stronger effect from this ability. For example, just three ability points, or one sub, allows a Gold Dynamo Roller user to swing their main weapon with full damage six times instead of the default five. However, it would be wise to invest even more ability points into Ink Saver (Main) to enable more use of the main weapon:[12]",
    "Last-Ditch Effort is a headgear-exclusive ability that, under specific conditions, grants its user 1 to 24 ability points each of the following abilities:",
    "These abilities only begin to take effect under either of the following conditions:",
    "A Gold Dynamo Roller user can potentially benefit greatly from Last-Ditch Effort, particularly from Ink Saver (Main) and Ink Recovery Up, allowing them to more freely use the main weapon during the final moments of a battle or whenever the opposing team has decreased their count a substantial amount.[12] However, a Gold Dynamo Roller user equipped with at least two mains of Ink Saver (Main) will have to decide whether it is worthwhile to sacrifice one full swing of their main weapon from the start of the battle for the possible trade-off of receiving two extra swings – one more than with another Ink Saver (Main) – late in the battle.",
    "Main Power Up increases damage to rollers by up to 15%, slightly increasing the lethal and two-hit ranges of the Gold Dynamo Roller, making it more consistent at inflicting damage.[12]",
    "Quick Super Jump decreases both the \"charge\" time before and the travel time of a Super Jump, allowing its user to escape more quickly. A Gold Dynamo Roller user struggles to escape from rushing opponents and would also have an incentive to maintain valuable special gauge progress for their Ink Armor.[12][13]",
    "Special Charge Up accelerates building up the special gauge for Ink Armor. Since farming Ink Armor is one of a few roles of the Gold Dynamo Roller, constantly having Ink Armor available for teammates ensures more successful pushes and counter-pushes.[12]",
    "Super Jumping to a teammate after respawning carries the risk of getting splatted upon landing, due to the appearance of a Super Jump indicator. A Dynamo Roller is particularly vulnerable upon landing and is not fast enough to splat campers and survive, unlike a Carbon or Splat Roller. When equipped, Stealth Jump better covers this indicator from long-distance opponents, allowing a Gold Dynamo Roller user to more safely return to the front lines and more quickly maintain turfing pressure on and zone out the opponent.[12]",
    "Due to being a heavyweight weapon, the Gold Dynamo Roller inherently slows the swim speed of its user. Swim Speed Up enables them to more quickly return to the site of engagement, more quickly respond to an opponents' push, and better keep their distance from aggressive opponents.[12]",
    "Not recommended. The weapon's white ink frames after attacking reduces the effectiveness of this ability, and is generally outclassed by Last-Ditch Effort.",
    "[15][16]",
    "- Its heavy damage enables it – sometimes with the help from Main Power Up – to destroy certain protective special weapons in one hit, such as Ink Armor and Baller.[2]",
    "- As with other rollers in Splatoon 2, one can now vary how to swing the Gold Dynamo Roller: horizontally when on the ground and vertically when in midair.\nTo perform a horizontal swing while jumping, press  first, then press .\nTo perform a horizontal swing after a jump or drop, wait until you land before pressing .",
    "- The long range of its swings – particularly the vertical swing – can reach over some obstacles, poke at and pressure opponents[5], even swat opposing Inkjet pilots in midair![6]",
    "- It can turf large areas with the horizontal swing and long swaths with the vertical one to create paths to swim along, all while quickly building up the special gauge.",
    "- To perform a horizontal swing while jumping, press  first, then press .",
    "- To perform a horizontal swing after a jump or drop, wait until you land before pressing .",
    "- Without the benefit of Main Power Up, the longer-reaching vertical swing has…\n…a lethal range of 130 DU, exceeding most short-ranged weapons, such as the Splattershot and the N-ZAP '85 (116.99 DU[7]).\n…a two-hit range of about 200 DU, which is much longer than that of the Kensa Splattershot Pro, the H-3 Nozzlenose D, and the Custom Dualie Squelchers (all 160.396 DU[7]) and just longer than that of the Bamboozler 14 Mk I (195.64 DU[7]).\n…a maximum range of about 240 DU, exceeding that of the Heavy Splatling (178.05-218.37 DU[7]) and the Ballpoint Splatling (225.04-237.094 DU[7]).",
    "- While not as long-ranged, the horizontal swing still has…\n…a lethal range of 110 DU, nearly matching that of the Splash-o-matic (110.03 DU[7]).\n…a two-hit range of about 165 DU, longer than that of the L-3 Nozzlenose (141.36 DU[7]) and the Mini Splatling (130.1-154.1 DU[7]).\n…a maximum range of about 185 DU, which is just shy of the burst fire mode of the Squeezer (187.39 DU[7]).",
    "- By increasing the damage output of both swings, Main Power Up can slightly increase these various ranges.",
    "- Because of the Gold Dynamo Roller's low mobility and long lag between swings, it is more effective in both suppressing the opponents' movement and punishing those who overextend than in pursuing them. Thus, it is usually best to remain a distance around the two-hit range from an opponent and only exploit the lethal damage should they come within the lethal range.",
    "- …a lethal range of 130 DU, exceeding most short-ranged weapons, such as the Splattershot and the N-ZAP '85 (116.99 DU[7]).",

    "- …a maximum range of about 185 DU, which is just shy of the burst fire mode of the Squeezer (187.39 DU[7]).",
    "- The heavyweight nature of the Gold Dynamo Roller slows its user down to a run speed of 0.88 DU/f[8], a swim speed of 1.73 DU/f[8], and a run speed of 0.24 DU/f while swinging the weapon, making a Gold Dynamo Roller user an easy target for an opponent wielding a long-ranged weapon, especially a charger.",
    "- The Gold Dynamo Roller is also very slow to wield, taking 65 frames – just over a second – to swing horizontally and 80 frames – 1.33 seconds – to swing vertically.\nThis long lag between swings makes a Gold Dynamo Roller user vulnerable at close range to rapid firing weapons.\nOnce  is pressed, a Gold Dynamo Roller user is committed to swinging their weapon and cannot cancel the swing by any means except by activating Ink Armor, a tactic that has little useful application. Therefore, be aware of your surroundings (i.e. be wary of opposing chargers, flanks, and sharks) and do not swing the weapon without a good purpose.",
    "- The Gold Dynamo Roller also consumes plenty of ink per swing (18% of the ink tank – equal to that of a Splat Charger), only capable of five swings before needing to refill.\nThis makes it dependent on ink-conserving and ink-recovering abilities in order to function optimally.\nCombined with its low mobility and long lag between swings, this also makes the Gold Dynamo Roller user an especially vulnerable target whenever they are surrounded by opposing ink, such as after getting hit by a Burst Bomb or a shot from an Explosher.\nKeep an eye on the ink tank and avoid traveling too far in turf covered by the opponents' ink.",

    "- A Splat Bomb can damage or destroy an opponent's brella shield, Splash Wall, or Baller or the Rainmaker shield, while detonating on contact.\nAny opponents caught within the Splat Bomb's explosion will get damaged or splatted.[9]\nIt will also inflate or pop a teammate's bubbles but deflate or diffuse an opponent's bubbles, while still detonating on contact.[10]",

    "- Time the activation of Ink Armor carefully so that you and your teammates receive its protection before engaging the opponent.",
    "- Try to activate Ink Armor when most or all teammates are active. Slayers, who risk getting splatted more often, benefit from Ink Armor more than anchors do.",
    "- Using Ink Armor also refills the ink tank. While this is particularly beneficial for a Gold Dynamo Roller user, refrain from using Ink Armor solely for this purpose.",
    "- Upon activation, Ink Armor will protect its user and their teammates except for those either carrying the Rainmaker or using either Baller or Booyah Bomb.\nAlso, players protected by Ink Armor lose it upon gaining possession of the Rainmaker.\nA support player, such as a Gold Dynamo Roller user in some compositions, is often expected to carry the Rainmaker while their slayer teammates provide protection up front while turfing a path of ink. Therefore, while Ink Armor will not protect the Rainmaker carrier, it will still benefit their teammates, so cast Ink Armor just before picking up the Rainmaker whenever possible.",

    "- The lack of mobility will make it difficult for such a team to mount a push.",
    "- The reduced ability to battle in close range will make the team vulnerable to a well-timed flank or a well-positioned shark.",
    "- In general, when two Ink Armor-based weapons are on a team, the user of the more aggressive weapon should activate Ink Armor first, freeing them to engage the opponent without potentially losing both a potential Ink Armor and special gauge progress. Because the Gold Dynamo Roller user is often the furthest back member of their team, if another, more mobile Ink Armor-based weapon user fills their special gauge first, the Dynamo user should wait for the latter to activate Ink Armor first then follow up with their Ink Armor as the first one wears off.",
    "- An opponent wielding a Gold Dynamo Roller is a slow moving, slow swinging target that is easy prey for a any long-ranged weapon user to pick off:\nThe Custom Hydra Splatling (203.92-257.68 DU[7]), the Splatterscope (260.37 DU[7]), the E-liter 4K (290.5 DU[7]), and the E-liter 4K Scope (310.5 DU[7]) all outrange the Gold Dynamo Roller and can splat opponents in one hit.\nWhile the Splat Charger has a similar range (240.37 DU[7]) to the maximum range of the Gold Dynamo Roller, it has a one-shot splat and is more mobile thanks to charge storing.\nWhile the Classic Squiffer (167.65 DU[7]), the Bamboozler 14 Mk I, the Jet Squelcher (212.64 DU[7]), the Heavy Splatling, and the Ballpoint Splatling all have shorter ranges than the maximum range of the Gold Dynamo Roller, each one can inflict damage more quickly than a Gold Dynamo Roller can.\nWhile the Explosher has a range (200 DU) and fire rate (70 frames) comparable to those of the Gold Dynamo Roller, the former can turf more quickly and heavily at this range, immobilizing an opposing Gold Dynamo Roller user and leaving them vulnerable for a teammate to splat.\nA pilot of the mobile and long-ranged Inkjet can exploit the Gold Dynamo Roller's lack of mobility but must take care not to get within the range of the opponent's vertical swing. Keep your distance – by hovering over higher ground if possible – and lead your shots.

    "- While the Gold Dynamo Roller has a long lag time between swings that can be exploited by short-ranged, rapid firing weapons, any user worth their salt is more than capable of punishing anyone who attempts to rush it head-on. To exploit this weakness, rely on timely flanking or careful sharking and catch the opposing Gold Dynamo Roller user by surprise. However, watch out for any Splat Bombs they might drop in self-defense.\nAn Inkbrush can normally get an easy splat by either rushing at or flanking a player with a Gold Dynamo Roller, but caution is advised if you rush at a Gold Dynamo Roller head-on, because they might swing their weapon just in time to stop an incoming Inkbrush.",
    "- Throwing bombs or Toxic Mist at an opposing Gold Dynamo Roller user can force them out of position and exploit their low mobility:\nSplat Bombs can be rolled at an opposing Gold Dynamo Roller user when they initiate a swing.
