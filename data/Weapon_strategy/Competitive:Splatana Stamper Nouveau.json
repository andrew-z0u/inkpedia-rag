  "content": "Like Splatana Stamper, Stamper Nouveau fills a similar role to the vanilla kit, however with a slightly less aggressive kit and a lack of a poking bomb, this kit plays more of a supporting role rather than an front-line slayer, switching to a more mid-line slayer/support flex.\n\nUsing the Splatana Stamper Nouveau requires the user to be aware of all of their options, meaning the user must be attentive to the stage, and keep note of their different slashes, sub, and special weapon, so they can use them at the right time for the best outcome.\n\n- There are 4 types of attack that a Stamper can use.\nProjectile tap shots (pressing  from a distance, does 35 damage.)\nDirect tap shots (pressing  right in front an enemy with the blade touching the enemy, does 20 damage, plus the 35 from the projectile, totaling in 55 damage.)\nProjectile charged shots (holding  from a distance until charged and released, does 70 damage.)\nDirect charged shots (holding  right in front an enemy until charged and released, with the blade touching the enemy, does 140 damage, plus the 70 from the projectile, totaling in 210 damage.)\nNote that in rare situations, sometimes only the blade of the weapon will touch the opponent, resulting in only 20 or 140 damage.\n\n- Projectile tap shots (pressing  from a distance, does 35 damage.)\n\n- Direct tap shots (pressing  right in front an enemy with the blade touching the enemy, does 20 damage, plus the 35 from the projectile, totaling in 55 damage.)\n\n- Projectile charged shots (holding  from a distance until charged and released, does 70 damage.)\n\n- Direct charged shots (holding  right in front an enemy until charged and released, with the blade touching the enemy, does 140 damage, plus the 70 from the projectile, totaling in 210 damage.)\nNote that in rare situations, sometimes only the blade of the weapon will touch the opponent, resulting in only 20 or 140 damage.\n\n- Note that in rare situations, sometimes only the blade of the weapon will touch the opponent, resulting in only 20 or 140 damage.\n\n- Projectile tap shots (pressing  from a distance, does 35 damage.)\n\n- Direct tap shots (pressing  right in front an enemy with the blade touching the enemy, does 20 damage, plus the 35 from the projectile, totaling in 55 damage.)\n\n- Projectile charged shots (holding  from a distance until charged and released, does 70 damage.)\n\n- Direct charged shots (holding  right in front an enemy until charged and released, with the blade touching the enemy, does 140 damage, plus the 70 from the projectile, totaling in 210 damage.)\nNote that in rare situations, sometimes only the blade of the weapon will touch the opponent, resulting in only 20 or 140 damage.\n\n- Note that in rare situations, sometimes only the blade of the weapon will touch the opponent, resulting in only 20 or 140 damage.\n\n- Note that in rare situations, sometimes only the blade of the weapon will touch the opponent, resulting in only 20 or 140 damage.\n\n- The Splatana Stamper can variate between horizontal and vertical slashes, along with ally attacks, to make multiple combos.\nThe bread and butter combo [1], a charged projectile and a tap projectile.\nA charged projectile and a shot from any weapon that does over 30 damage per shot. (A few common options in competitive include Splattershot, .52 Gal, Squeezer, Snipewriter, or a Burst Bomb.)\nA tap direct and a shot from any weapon that does over 45 damage (A few common options in competitive include Dread Wringer, a close swing with Carbon Roller, a direct hit with Sloshing Machine, most Blaster class indirects, or a Burst Bomb direct.)\nSome context for a situation like this would be if a Stamper rushed in and got a tap direct, only to be immediately splatted. An ally attack can make their efforts worth it.\nA projectile tap shot, a direct tap shot and a shot from any weapon or sub weapon.\nThe same context applies, but the Stamper managed to get a tap projectile along with the tap direct.\n\n- The bread and butter combo [1], a charged projectile and a tap projectile.\n\n- A charged projectile and a shot from any weapon that does over 30 damage per shot.

It hinders an enemy and for the most part removes all movement or escape options, aside from Super Jumping. It can be used in a variety of ways to assist a team in a push, or to try and stop one.\n\n- Using Toxic Mist in a congested area is a smart decision that can not only help the user, but teammates as well take over mid as well as other areas. This can help trap enemies and help teammates locate them, leading to an easy wipeout.\nEven after ensuring all enemies have left mid, it is a bad choice to assume victory. Checking the HUD at the top of the screen is a smart option to ensure that there are not any backlines or Anchors lingering that could be a threat to the player or their teammates.\n\n- Even after ensuring all enemies have left mid, it is a bad choice to assume victory.

Be mindful however, this also applies to the user when thrown, leaving only enough ink for 2 full vertical slashes.\n\n- Toxic Mist is helpful against backline or ink heavy weapons, as it renders them almost useless due to their ink being drained.

Before being splatted, a Stamper can throw Toxic Mist to prevent their splatter from escaping, allowing a teammate to finish what the Stamper could not.\nIt is not recommended to rely on this strategy, due to Splatana Stamper's high ink consumption.\n\n- It is not recommended to rely on this strategy, due to Splatana Stamper's high ink consumption.\n\n- It is not recommended to rely on this strategy, due to Splatana Stamper's high ink consumption.\n\nCrab Tank is a powerful special that can easily turn the tides in a mid fight, or defend turf from being taken. While it leaves the player vulnerable in some cases, overall it fits Stamper well in playstyle and assists the kit wonderfully.\n\n- Crab Tank is helpful for most Ranked objectives, for example, capping zone, popping the Rainmaker shield, and cheesing Tower Control, by easily preventing enemies from getting on. Even in Clam Blitz, it can help in a push, especially on stages like Inkblot Art Academy, Crableg Capital, and Hammerhead Bridge.\n\n- The Crab Tank has two firing modes, a rapid fire double reticle similar to Douser Dualie shots that speed up as they are held, and an explosive launch mode, similar to Explosher projectiles.\n\n- Crab Tank is a great zoning special, and works well with teammate attacks. Using Crab Tank near high areas with access to mid, like on the stages Barnacle & Dime, Flounder Heights, and Brinewater Springs, is generally advantageous and results in a good outcome.\n\n- While Crab Tank is sometimes used as a panic button, this is not recommended for this weapon in specific, as in many situations where a panic button would be helpful, Splatana Stamper is a better option to simply fight off enemies.\n\nToxic Mist and Crab Tank can also be used together in multiple ways, and using them as such can not only get several splats, but also create push opportunities for teammates as well as the user.\n\n- Using Toxic Mist from a distance on opponents, then using Crab Tank, can make for an easy splat.\nUsing this on multiple opponents is a better option, as to get more value from it.\nFighting long ranged weapons is difficult, but using Toxic Mist as a trap and using Crab Tank can eliminate dangerous threats before they can attack the user or a teammate. That is why this is not recommended for short ranged weapons, as it would be a waste.\n\n- Using this on multiple opponents is a better option, as to get more value from it.\n\n- Fighting long ranged weapons is difficult, but using Toxic Mist as a trap and using Crab Tank can eliminate dangerous threats before they can attack the user or a teammate.

That is why this is not recommended for short ranged weapons, as it would be a waste.\n\n- Using Toxic Mist on a seemingly empty area could catch a sharking weapon, like a Carbon Roller or a Krak-On Splat Roller. Once this is done, they can easily be attacked with the main weapon or Crab Tank.\n\n- While attacking someone with a Crab Tank, if it runs out, a good option is to throw a Toxic Mist at them to prevent them from escaping or approaching you.\nBeware what kind of weapon it is however. If it is a heavy weapon like Hydra Splatling or an easy one hit weapon like Custom Range Blaster, it would be better to let them leave, unless the user has a teammate with them.\n\n- Beware what kind of weapon it is however.

Using Crab Tank when they do can give them a rude awakening, and the user a quick splat.\n\nIf a teammate has a Point Sensor, Angle Shooter, or Wave Breaker, this can be even more helpful as to be able to know where opponents are.\n\nStealth Jump is an essential ability for any front-line weapon. When equipped, Stealth Jump better covers the super jump indicator from long distance opponents, allowing its user to more safely return to the front lines and maintain pressure on the opponent.[1]\n\nThe Splatana Stamper Nouveau's charged slashes consume a lot of ink. Running 2 subs provides an extra charged slash before running out of ink.[1]\n\nSwim speed up can greatly assist with chasing fleeing enemies or escaping from an unfavourable fight, for example it can be useful to get away quickly if a short ranged weapon like Splash-o-matic has closed the distance and could quickly splat the user with its better fire rate up close.[1]\n\nThe Splatana Stamper Nouveau is very ink hungry, and toxic mist consumes 55% of the ink tank. This ability can be used to recover ink faster, allowing the user to spend less time recovering ink and more time to stay in the fight."
