    "While one user of a short-ranged weapon such as the Clear Dapple Dualies might get away with a lack of range, having too many short-ranged weapons on a team without a longer-ranged weapon to provide support fire is often disadvantageous for a number of reasons:[2]",
    "Gear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.",
    "Quick Respawn shortens respawn time after getting splatted (under specific conditions), encouraging a Clear Dapple Dualies user to remain aggressive even after getting splatted.",
    "Super Jumping to a teammate after respawning carries the risk of getting splatted upon landing, due to the appearance of a Super Jump indicator. When equipped, Stealth Jump better covers this indicator from long distance opponents, allowing its user to more safely return to the front lines and maintain pressure on the opponent.",
    "Not recommended, as this ability does not make the Clear Dapple Dualies reach any notable damage threshold such as 49.9 or 99.9.",
    "This will let the player get to longer ranged weapons and sub strafing can be useful.",

    "- Clear Dapple Dualies are a pure slayer's weapon, having high DPS, fire rate, and mobility at the cost of having short range and low accuracy.\nTry to get opponents as close as possible to maximize the Clear Dapple Dualies' power.\nThe weapon is lightweight, being able to get back to the battlefield quicker than others.\nBecause of its low accuracy, shots may miss the opponent giving the opponent the chance to escape or even splat the user.",
    "- The main advantage of the Clear Dapple Dualies is its fast dodge rolls, giving it more mobility than the Splat Dualies.\nThe dodge rolls of the Clear Dapple Dualies are fast and may get the user out of danger in a pinch.\nThe dodge rolls are helpful when super jumping, as the speed can get the user out without getting splatted.\nThe cost of the quick dodge rolls is the short distance traveled, costing the user if trying to escape.",
    "- Torpedo can be used to pressure opponents that are out of your range.\nTo deal massive amounts of pressure, you can throw a Torpedo at someone who is in range, and while it activates, attack the opponent. This will make the opponent have two targets, and as long as you hit them at least once, they will most likely get splatted.\nIf damage is dealt to an opponent with a Splashdown but is not splatted, skip a Torpedo across the ground in their direction. If the explosion from the torpedo hits the opponent, the combined damage should splat the opponent.\nThis will not work on Autobombs, because then the opponents will still have one target.",
    "- The Splashdown can either turn the tide of a battle or be canceled quite easily.\nThe Splashdown can create combos of splash damage with the hits from the main weapon.\nThe safest way to execute a Splashdown is by super jumping to a teammate.\nUsing Super Jump can be a surprise for opponents that are not aware of the UI that indicates specials ready from the opponent team.\nMost weapons can cancel the special mid-Splashdown, so it is best to make sure that the opponent you are confronting has a weapon that takes multiple shots for a splat or has low range.\nThe Splashdown can cancel formation of Bubbles making it a quick and fast way of removing them.\nThe Splashdown can be used from higher ledges making it more powerful and extending its radius of splash damage.\nThe worst scenario for a Splashdown is when used as a panic button to get out from a sticky situation, as it can be predicted and aimed for it to be canceled.",

    "- Clear Dapple Dualies have an extremely high DPS but short range.\nTo counter this, use a slayer with more range than Clear Dapple Dualies, such as Kensa Splattershot Pro. Weapons like Kensa Splattershot won't work as well because Clear Dapple Dualies can roll into range.",
    "- Keep an eye on the HUD to know when an opposing Clear Dapple Dualies user has Splashdown ready to avoid getting caught by surprise, especially from a Splashdown after a super jump:\nIf an opposing Clear Dapple Dualies user activates a Splashdown in an unsafe position, it can be canceled quite easily from fast firing weapons and chargers.\nThe opposing Clear Dapple Dualies user might go for risky plays if they know they have the Splashdown ready as a safety net. It is possible to bait them to take control of an open space and surprise them with a teammate to force a mid-Splashdown situation and cancel it.",
