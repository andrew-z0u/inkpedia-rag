The role of each Infobox shows its current status. Thank you for taking the time to look at this, and don't forget to Stay Fresh!\n\nP.S. Please note that images for Splatoon (the first game in the series) will be using the icons from Splatnet, available in the gallery for the weapon. (on it's respective page)"
