    "This special is useful in very narrow stages including Hammerhead Bridge and Port Mackerel, this is because of the killer wail's large width and length. even though the killer wail does not give off any ink, unlike the Sting Ray, the only way to give off any ink is if it splats anybody, which will get your team about 1-15 percent of turf. In Tower Control you can use killer wail to force opponents off the tower, giving your team the chance to push."
