  "paragraphs": [
    "Debuting in Splatoon 3 at the beginning of Drizzle Season 2023, the Heavy Edit Splatling is based on the Mini Splatling, having a longer charge time and less damage per shot in exchange for a very rapid fire rate when fully charged and longer range while still maintaining high mobility while charging and firing. These traits make this weapon flexible enough to play either aggressively or supportively and fit in a wide variety of team compositions.[1][2][3]",
    "The Heavy Edit Splatling features a supportive weapon set that boosts its already high mobility, further enhancing its high versatility.",
    "While the Heavy Edit Splatling's turfing and Tacticooler make it primarily a supportive anchor, its mobility and damage output enable it to also make more aggressive plays as necessary:[1][2][3]",
    "The Heavy Edit Splatling has two notable weaknesses:[1][2]",
    "The Curling Bomb offers a few practical uses for a Heavy Edit Splatling user:",
    "If deployed properly, the Tacticooler can enhance a team's lockout or push, or counter the opponents' push:[9]",
    "Besides turfing and Tacticooler, the Heavy Edit Splatling has flexibility thanks to its high fire rate, object damage, and mobility, allowing it to sometimes play more aggressively than a typical anchor. However, its relative lack of range versus true anchors (and some longer-ranged skirmishers and slayers) will need to be accounted for when forming a composition, and a displacement special weapon and throwable bombs will also need to be included:[11][12]",
    "An opposing Heavy Edit Splatling user provides firepower, turfing, and Tacticooler to both support their team and occasionally join the fray. Their elimination will reduce their team's ability to make pushes, but splatting them will not be easy without a longer-ranged weapon and a clear sightline.",
    "Like other splatling users, a Heavy Edit Splatling user spends a longer amount of time out of their ink running than do users of most other weapon classes. Thus, they tend to devote a good portion of their gear abilities toward improving their mobility while running and firing and charging.[3][14]",
    "Already a valuable utility sub for most players, Ink Resistance Up is even more valuable for splatling users due to their extended time out of their ink. It delays the time when damage is taken from contact with opposing ink and partially offsets the reduction in mobility, the latter trait being useful when pursuing opponents or escaping unfavorable situations.[6]",
    "Like most splatlings and other automatic fire weapons, the Heavy Edit Splatling suffers from increased shot spread after jumping. Intensify Action is a utility sub that greatly reduces the shot spread after jumping even with just one or two subs. Even with Tacticooler equipped (which would fully reduce the jumping shot spread to match that of the grounded shot spread), permanently reducing their jumping shot spread would permit a Heavy Edit Splatling user to extend their range and fire at overhead targets by jumping without losing too much of their accuracy:[6]",
    "There will likely be moments when a Heavy Edit Splatling user will be forced to Super Jump to flee from rushing opponents. Quick Super Jump shortens the vulnerability time at the start of performing a Super Jump, increasing their likelihood of escape.[6]",
    "Like other splatling users, a Heavy Edit Splatling user generally remains out of their ink relatively longer than other weapon users do, strafing while firing and ducking behind cover while charging. Run Speed Up increases their already great mobility, even when Tacticooler is not active:[6]",
    "While the Heavy Edit Splatling's great turfing and moderate special gauge requirement ensure a steady Tacticooler supply, increasing its output can sustain longer pushes. Having even a little Special Charge Up can effectively reduce the special gauge requirement by a modest amount:[6]",
    "Whenever your team is enhanced with Tacticooler, opponents might attempt to stall your push with longer-ranged main weapons, bombs, or certain special weapons, such as Crab Tank. Special Power Up serves as a utility sub for Tacticooler-equipped weapons, including the Heavy Edit Splatling, increasing the duration of Tacticooler's effects:[6]",
    "Heavy Edit Splatling users who play more aggressively to exploit their weapon's firepower and mobility can use Special Saver to lower the special gauge lost upon getting splatted. Special Saver can also reduce the impact of an opponent's Respawn Punisher as well:[6]",
    "An essential ability for most players, Stealth Jump better covers the Super Jump landing marker from distant opponents, allowing a Heavy Edit Splatling user to more safely return to the front lines and continue to provide crossfire, turfing, and Tacticooler for their teammates.",
    "Shorter-ranged opponents often target Heavy Edit Splatling users with bombs. Sub Resistance Up reduces the amount of damage taken from splash damage (but not direct hits) by lethal bombs and both direct hits and splash damage by nonlethal bombs, such as Burst Bombs:[6]",
    "Upon its introduction at the start of Drizzle Season 2023, the Heavy Edit Splatling's high fire rate, great turfing, high mobility, and synergistic kit made good first impressions, earning it consideration for the best new weapon of the season. The few concerns that were raised were its lack of range compared to true anchor weapons, its longer charge time, and its Tacticooler output versus other Tacticooler-equipped weapons, particularly the N-ZAP '85 and the Snipewriter 5H.[15][16][17]",
    "Thanks to a turfing buff in version 6.0.0 (which was slightly toned back in 9.0.0), the Heavy Edit Splatling's Tacticooler output increased, allowing it to match or even surpass that of some other Tacticooler-equipped weapons. While this did not address the range and charge time issues, its mobility and improved turfing made it an attractive option for teams looking for more mobile compositions, allowing it to potentially catch up with other Tacticooler options.[18] By version 8.1.0, the Heavy Edit Splatling was treated by most western competitive players as a substitute for the Snipewriter 5H in similar team compositions, particularly on stages whose geometry offer players more cover against an opposing charger user, such as Undertow Spillway and Flounder Heights.[19]",
    "In the five months following version 9.0.0 in Japan, the Heavy Edit Splatling was seen as on par with the Snipewriter 5H due to both the former's strengths and the latter receiving turfing nerfs (versions 9.0.0 and 9.3.0) and special gauge requirement increases (versions 7.2.0 and 9.3.0). By version 9.3.0, western competitive opinion on the viability of the Heavy Edit Splatling caught up with that of Japan. While the Snipewriter 5H is still considered the better, more stable option for anchor and Tacticooler provider in the west, the Heavy Edit Splatling is praised for its higher flexibility and better synergy with certain special weapons, namely Big Bubbler and Crab Tank.[1][11][20]",

    "- If fully charged, it has the quickest fire rate in the game at one shot per 3 frames or 20 shots per second—tied with that of the Ballpoint Splatling's first stage, giving it one of the fastest splatting times at about 12 frames or 0.2 seconds. This enables an accurate Heavy Edit Splatling user to splat an opposing Zipcaster user flying towards them.[4]\nIf partially charged, it fires at one shot per 4 frames or 15 shots per second—equal to that of most other splatlings.\nWhile not benefiting from any damage multipliers, the Heavy Edit Splatling's very rapid fire rate allows it to quickly destroy opponents' objects, including Crab Tanks, Big Bubblers, even Booyah Bomb armor.[5]\nUnlike users of chargers and other line of sight weapons, a Heavy Edit Splatling user can damage and splat opponents hiding behind obstacles with falloff damage by raising the angle of their shots over said obstacles. This makes the main weapon more flexible on stages that provide numerous forms of cover, such as Humpback Pump Track.\nIts very rapid fire rate also enables its user to quickly turf their surroundings to take or maintain map control, contest or capture Splat Zones, and farm Tacticooler.",
    "- It also features great ink efficiency to offset its long charge time (see below), allowing its user to refill their ink tank less often and maintain uptime longer.",
    "- It enables its user to run very quickly while shooting (0.86 units per frame) and charging (0.72 units per frame), equal to those of the Mini Splatling.[6] This allows them to quickly retreat behind cover to recharge their weapon, aggressively pursue opponents, and dodge opposing fire—even dissuading Splatana Stamper users from using charged slashes.[7]\nUsing cover will provide not only time and space to charge your weapon but also protection from line of sight weapons, such as splatanas.",

    "- Its main concern is its relative lack of range (just shy of that of a Nautilus) compared to longer-ranged opponents, especially other anchors:\nThe most threatening matchup a Heavy Edit Splatling user could face is against opposing charger users, all of which outrange the Heavy Edit Splatling—typically by a wide margin. Avoid an opposing charger user's sightlines and refrain from challenging them unless you can either flank them or catch them out of position.\nWhile the Squeezer, the Splatana Stamper, and the Decavitator all can outrange the Heavy Edit Splatling, the latter provides faster strafe speed:[6]",

    "- If an opponent is suspected to be ledge-camping, a Curling Bomb (charged if necessary) can flush them out, but be wary of the opponent's attacks (e.g., area of effect, or AoE).",
    "- Depending on the surface geometry, it can sometimes be used to poke at the opponent's position:\nParticularly in narrow or closed areas, a Curling Bomb ricocheting off of walls can be a useful distraction to force an opponent to move in a certain direction.\nOn some stages, it can be thrown over certain walls and ledges by standing very close it then throwing it over at maximum jump height.[8]",

    "- On some stages, it can be thrown over certain walls and ledges by standing very close it then throwing it over at maximum jump height.[8]",
    "- It is recommended to deploy your Tacticooler just before engaging the opposing team if at least two team members (including yourself) can collect a drink.",
    "- In general, the most optimal Tacticooler location is either around the area your team is staging a lockout or along the objective's path through which your team is pushing.\nAs a Heavy Edit Splatling user, remember that you tend to be positioned behind your teammates, so move closer to the frontline before deploying your Tacticooler.[10]",
    "- While the cooler itself can be used as a temporary shield against opposing fire, its presence might invite opponents to fire sub or special weapons at its location.",
    "- Do not forget to grab a drink for yourself! While aggressive weapon users tend to benefit the most from Tacticooler, a Heavy Edit Splatling user also has much to gain from it:\nThe Ink Resistance allows you to move through opposing ink with almost no penalty, discouraging opponents from shooting near you to trap you and allowing you to take more aggressive positions without needing to turf for yourself first.\nBoth Run Speed Up and Swim Speed Up enhance your already good mobility, allowing you to more quickly strafe around opposing fire and pursue targets. However, since it does not stack with your existing gear, it won't be as powerful as one might expect.\nA maxed out Quick Super Jump ability helps you nearly instantly escape from bad situations or advance forward much faster.",

    "- To avoid getting grossly outranged by an opponent's composition, at least one teammate should wield a weapon with longer range than the Heavy Edit Splatling:\nFrontline weapons that fit this category include the Squeezer and the Splatana Stamper. While the former offers tools that directly deal with longer-ranged anchors (Splash Wall to limit their range, Trizooka to splat them outright), the latter has even longer range and Burst Bombs to combo with the Heavy Edit Splatling.\nLike the Heavy Edit Splatling, the Flingza Roller is self-sufficient against short-ranged, rushdown opponents, making the pair (accompanied by two mid-ranged aggressive weapons) great at countering dive compositions. Its Tenta Missiles are also a great displacement tool, especially against opposing longer-ranged anchors.[13]\nBoth the Rapid Blaster Pro Deco and (less commonly) the Custom Explosher can occupy the anchor position and provide useful chip damage from afar, while the Heavy Edit Splatling slots in support.",
    "- Including at least one other weapon that is efficient at turfing will lighten the turfing and map control load for the Heavy Edit Splatling user and give the team the freedom to include a turf-negative weapon, such as a blaster.",
    "- Having at least one throwable bomb provides the team more reliable poking, spacing, combo potential, and active area denial than the Heavy Edit Splatling's Curling Bomb.",
    "- The Heavy Edit Splatling's ability to play aggressively avoids overlapping with other weapons with Crab Tank (such as Splash-o-matic or Splat Dualies), which can temporarily play the role of anchor while riding the Crab Tank.",
    "- Since Heavy Edit Splatling needs cover in order to charge up safely, a Big Bubbler can be very useful for allowing it to take space in more open areas. It also protects the Heavy Edit Splatling from chargers and other long-range anchors.",

However, should they ever flank you and get within their range, their mobility and firepower give them the advantage.\nSome longer-ranged skirmisher and slayer weapons (Squeezer, Stamper, and Decavitator) outrange an opposing Heavy Edit Splatling user. However, the latter's mobility can make them a harder target to hit, requiring precise tap shots to splat.[7]",
    "- Shorter-ranged weapon users should rely more on flanking or sharking to pick off an opposing Heavy Edit Splatling user.\nLike with other splatlings, the closer you are to an opposing Heavy Edit Splatling user, the harder it will be for them to track you to maintain sustained fire on you.",
    "- An AoE-style weapon user (e.g., blasters, sloshers) can exploit cover, such as a ledge, to not only avoid the opposing Heavy Edit Splatling user's line of sight but also damage their opponent without having to expose themselves. However, be aware that the opposing Heavy Edit Splatling user can still rely on falloff damage.",
    "- With its high amount of HP, a Splash Wall or a Tenta Brella's shield can stall an opposing Heavy Edit Splatling user and limit their range of influence.",
    "- Bombs and displacement special weapons launched at an opposing Heavy Edit Splatling user can briefly force them out of position and throw off their aim and charges.",
    "- If an opponent's Curling Bomb travels nearby, immediately turf the trail it leaves behind to both cut off lanes of attack and flush out any opponents. Even if an opposing Heavy Edit Splatling user does not swim on this trail, their more aggressive teammates might do so to move about the stage.",
    "- Keep an eye on the HUD to know when an opposing Heavy Edit Splatling user has their Tacticooler ready, and both watch for when it is deployed and listen to its jingle.\nIf you can splat–or at least trade with–the opposing Heavy Edit Splatling user just before they have their Tacticooler ready, then you could relieve your team of the pressure it would otherwise face from a fully enhanced opposing team.\nCertain sub and special weapons can temporarily deny your opponents access to their Tacticooler (or splat them as they attempt to collect a drink) if it is ever misplaced.\nSharking around their cooler can also provide an opportunity to pick off opponents and remove their enhancements.\nIf positioned carefully, a Crab Tank or Big Bubbler can help stall an opposing Tacticooler push, which can buy time for your team to respawn or prepare a counter-push.\nIf your team does not have a Tacticooler ready (or has no Tacticoolers in its composition) when your opponents are under the effects of Tacticooler, then your team will need to win the first overall team fight outright, then win or trade the second overall team fight to prevent your opponents from sustaining a long lockout or push.",

    "- While every player is recommended to have at least one sub (3 AP) of Quick Super Jump, a Heavy Edit Splatling player might be more inclined to have two subs (6 AP) to increase their survivability, which better ensures that their team will have turfing, mid-range firepower, and a constant Tacticooler supply."
