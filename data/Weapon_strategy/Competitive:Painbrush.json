  "content": "The Painbrush is a weapon that was introduced in Sizzle Season 2023 and is in the class of brushes. The weapon has the ability to fling ink and slide across a stage. It plays a hybrid of the support and slayer roles as it can kill at a distance and also paint well. Unlike the other members of its class, the Painbrush's range means it can pose a threat at a distance.\n\n- 1 Splatoon 3\n\n1.1 Use\n1.2 Synergy\n1.3 Countermeasures\n1.4 Gear abilities[1]\n\n- 1.1 Use\n\n- 1.2 Synergy\n\n- 1.3 Countermeasures\n\n- 1.4 Gear abilities[1]\n\n- 2 References\n\n- 1.1 Use\n\n- 1.2 Synergy\n\n- 1.3 Countermeasures\n\n- 1.4 Gear abilities[1]\n\nThe Painbrush is a brush that has two main mechanics: flinging ink and sliding. These two mechanics are similar to those of its class, except the Painbrush has the highest damage and range in its class.\n\n- The flinging attack can splat an enemy after 2-4 hits pointed at the player making it the most reliable brush for combo damage.\n\n- Ink consumption while sliding for Painbrush is 10.8% per second; to compare, the Octobrush consumes 9% ink per second while sliding and the Inkbrush consumes 7.5% per second.\n\n- Painbrush sliding is the second fastest brush (with the Inkbrush coming in first).\n\n- The weapon has a 23 frame delay when the ZR button is pressed, after which it can be swung every 13 frames (4.62 times per second) to compare the Inkbrush can be swung every 6 frames (10 per second) and the Octobrush can be swung every 10 frames (6 per second).\n\n- The brush deals a base damage of 60 and minimum damage of 31. In comparison, the Octobrush deals a base damage of 40 and the Inkbrush deals a base damage of 30.\n\n- The Painbrush is similar to the Sloshing Machine with its range and damage so competitive Sloshing Machine tips may also apply.\n\n- The Painbrush has high fall off damage.\n\nCompared to the Inkbrush and Octobrush, the Painbrush requires much more ink and has a slower overall speed, but deals almost double the damage. It can be seen as the brush equivalent of the Dynamo Roller.\n\n- The Curling Bomb can help the Painbrush as a mobility tool and to poke at enemies from a distance in the manner that the Splat Roller does. However, it consumes a lot of ink, which makes it hard to use with the main weapon, but swimming through the ink of the Curling Bomb refills the ink tank. It can be used to go around un-inked areas or enemy ink.\n\n- Wave Breaker can help it to combo up close and locate enemies. It can also act as an ink refill tool as ink is refilled upon using special weapons.\n\n- Because the Painbrush is a slow weapon with high damage, it is good to sneak up on players whilst distracted or injured, as they may take too long to fight back.\n\n- Painbrush's range is similar to that of a Splattershot. This should be kept in mind when fighting opponents.\n\n- The Painbrush's range and high damage makes it good for popping the Rainmaker's shield.\n\n- The weapon can be somewhat effective for attacking targets at height or behind an obstacle, as it can still deal damage while its shots are falling (albeit less).\n\n- The Painbrush consumes a lot of ink, so it would not have much ink left after using a Curling Bomb. Attempting to splat one when it has less ink to fight with is more favorable compared to rushing it head on while it still has a full tank. If the player has more range, they can try to splat the Painbrush at a distance so it cannot damage them.\n\n- The Painbrush's reaction is also very slow; if a player wields a quicker weapon, they'll have a higher chance at survival compared to a slower weapon.\n\n- The Painbrush takes a long time to start rolling, because of the windup; if a Painbrush is trying to back away and run, that is one of the best times to attempt to splat it.\n\n- When the Painbrush begins swinging, its strafing speed is extremely slow. Backline weapons should try to attack it, such as weapons like the E-liter 4K or its scoped variant; the brush will be an easy splat.\n\nHelps combat the main weapon's low ink efficiency.\n\nHelps combat the sub weapon's low ink efficiency. While it is not needed as much ever since Version 5.1.0, it can still be very useful.\n\nHelps recover ink quicker, which is especially helpful considering the white-ink frames that come from using a Curling Bomb.\n\nPairs well with Curling Bomb, increases mobility. Also allows you to move into other parts of the map quickly to help with things like objective and enemy control.\n\nAllows for being more aggressive without risk of wasting time in case of an attack failure.\n\nMakes it easier to sneak up on enemies, and also allows you to move into sharking positions without being noticed.\n\nStealth Jump helps with stealth, will help prevent immediate attacks upon landing from a Super Jump, as the Painbrush has a long windup time before it can swing and cannot defend itself easily.\n\n- https://youtube.com/watch?v=fYYKsdkk4Qk&pp=ygUVc3BsYXRvb24gMyBwYWludGJydXNo"
