    "The REEF-LUX 450 is both a support and slayer-type weapon, part of the Stringer class. Similar to the Tri-Stringer, this weapon launches a trio of ink bullets that can immediately splat enemies if charged long enough. Dissimilarly, this weapon charges faster, can hold a full charge in swim form, but cannot fire exploding projectiles.",
    "The REEF-LUX has three different options of fire that best suit different situations.",
    "The Splash Wall has a couple of uses.",
    "Reefslider also has a variety of uses.",
    "This is a list of abilities that are generally good for the REEF-LUX.",
    "Opening Gambit is good for the REEF-LUX because of its ability to swiftly splat opponents. Since its bullets diffuse and have a good chance to hit an opponent, it can also assist teammates in splatting opponents to keep the ability going. The effects of the ability are very useful, too. It increases movement speed, which the REEF-LUX can utilize well.",
    "Special Charge Up is also popular because of the REEF-LUX's ability to spam Reefslider. Getting Reefslider faster and more often will help it be more aggressive. This is also useful in Splat Zones, where Reefsliders can take the Splat Zone quickly.",
    "Swim Speed Up helps the REEF-LUX be more mobile. Swim Speed Up helps it get to places quicker and makes it more unpredictable while fighting, because it can hold a charge.",
    "If the player decides to play REEF-LUX aggressively, Quick Respawn can help the REEF-LUX respawn quicker and have less downtime after being splatted.",
    "Quick Super Jump can help the player get back in the game quicker after respawning and escape quicker when being pursued.",
    "When playing aggressively, Special Saver decreases the amount of special lost after respawning. This works well because the REEF-LUX can get splatted a lot, and can help the player regain the special charge they had before getting splatted.",
    "Comeback increases the mobility of the REEF-LUX for a short time after spawning. As stated earlier, extra mobility can help the REEF-LUX a lot. And if playing aggressive, the REEF-LUX can get splatted a lot.",
    "Special Power Up can help the REEF-LUX 450 deco. Special Power Up increases the radius of the Reefslider explosion, making it more likely that a zone will be instantly captured or an enemy instantly splatted.",
    "The REEF-LUX does not paint the player's feet well and is vulnerable while charging, so stepping in enemy ink is nearly unavoidable in fights. Ink Resistance Up helps the REEF-LUX retain some of its mobility while fighting and decreases the rate at which the player takes damage in enemy ink.",
    "Run Speed Up amplifies the REEF-LUX's fast charging speed. This is useful for avoiding enemy fire in combat and help it advance faster.",
    "Currently, the REEF-LUX 450 Deco does not see much use outside of Splat Zones, where it can cheese the Splat Zone with Reefslider often. The existence of its other kit, the REEF-LUX 450, also makes the REEF-LUX Deco obsolete, as its other version is considered stronger.",

    "- The REEF-LUX 450 is a support weapon because:\nIts fast fire rate and excellent turfing ability allows it to provide map control for teammates.\nIts diffusion of bullets can chip away at enemies so teammates can easily splat them.",
    "- The REEF-LUX is a slayer weapon because:\nIt can charge its fatal ink bullets almost instantly.\nIts charge speed in the air also matches its charge speed on the ground, similar to the Squiffer. This allows the weapon to jump repeatedly to avoid enemy fire without a charge speed penalty.\nIt can hold its charge, allowing it to quickly move around into better positions.",

    "- Tap shots are used to paint the map and charge the special meter.",
    "- Partial charges are used for close range enemies for swift splats.",
    "- Full charges are used for sniping from longer ranges.",
    "- Placing a splash wall can protect the REEF-LUX while sniping at longer ranges.",
    "- The REEF-LUX can shower with the Splash Wall in close range combat to protect itself.\nHowever, be careful of incoming Splat Bombs and other exploding sub weapons as they explode immediately on contact with the Splash Wall, which can end up fatal if you are not careful.",
    "- Throwing a Splash Wall against a corner can protect you completely from enemy fire, which can protect a super jump into a safer position.",
    "- However, be careful of incoming Splat Bombs and other exploding sub weapons as they explode immediately on contact with the Splash Wall, which can end up fatal if you are not careful.",
    "- The Reefslider can be used to clear the way for pushes into enemy turf.",
    "- The Reefslider can also be used to stop enemy pushes into your turf.",
    "- If enemies are huddled together, Reefslider can quickly disperse or splat them.",
    "- If enemies happen to avoid the lethal explosion, the outer explosion radius deals 70 damage, which can combo with the REEF-LUX's charge shots.",
    "- Try quickly aiming at enemies before using the Reefslider. The rails paint a path which can hinder enemies' movement, decreasing their odds of avoiding the lethal explosion.",
    "- The painting radius of the Reefslider also makes it very useful for taking the Splat Zone quickly.\nKeep in mind that the Reefslider is very vulnerable after exploding, so any mistake can end up fatal. Generally only use the Reefslider when you are sure it will succeed.",
    "- Keep in mind that the Reefslider is very vulnerable after exploding, so any mistake can end up fatal. Generally only use the Reefslider when you are sure it will succeed.",
    "- As a slayer, this weapon does well with backup from frontline slayers and/or supporting fire from other support weapons, as this weapon is not as independent as others.",
    "- In Tacticooler comps, the REEF-LUX does well. Tacticooler's effects increase the mobility of the REEF-LUX further. It especially helps with the Reefslider special, which can easily be punished. The Tacticooler's Quick Respawn effects can help the REEF-LUX recover quickly.",
    "- The REEF-LUX also has great painting capabilities, so pairing it with weapons that can't paint as well, such as the Custom Range Blaster, can provide aid to non-painting weapons so they can move freely without having to worry about turf control.",
    "- The REEF-LUX takes time to charge its bullets, so weapons that can rush it down before it can charge them-such as the Splattershot-can take care of REEF-LUX users with some ease.",
    "- The REEF-LUX's bullets have slight diffusion, so weapons with high mobility that can avoid its one-shot such as the Heavy Edit Splatling can avoid getting splatted.",
    "- The REEF-LUX also has a shorter range compared to some other slayers, so zoning it out with weapons such as the Splatana Stamper can splat it while being safe from its fast-charging snipes.\\\\"
