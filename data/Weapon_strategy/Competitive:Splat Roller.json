  "content": "Ever since debuting at the launch of the original Splatoon, the Splat Roller has been the epitome of a sharking weapon due to its reliable one-hit-splat and proficient ledge-camping. Compared to the Splattershot and other short-ranged shooters, it boasts higher damage and a larger hitbox and turfs with large swaths of ink at the cost of range and fire rate, requiring the rest of the team composition to be built around it. Since Splatoon 2, its user can swing it vertically as well as horizontally, not only enhancing its splatting and ledge-camping but also enabling its user to poke at and space out opponents.[1][2][3][4]\n\n- 1 Splatoon 2\n\n1.1 Use\n1.2 Synergy\n1.3 Countermeasures\n1.4 Gear abilities\n\n- 1.1 Use\n\n- 1.2 Synergy\n\n- 1.3 Countermeasures\n\n- 1.4 Gear abilities\n\n- 2 Splatoon 3\n\n2.1 Use\n2.2 Gear abilities\n\n- 2.1 Use\n\n- 2.2 Gear abilities\n\n- 3 References\n\n- 1.1 Use\n\n- 1.2 Synergy\n\n- 1.3 Countermeasures\n\n- 1.4 Gear abilities\n\n- 2.1 Use\n\n- 2.2 Gear abilities\n\nThe Splat Roller (along with the Hero Roller Replica) comes with the Curling Bomb, a new sub weapon that greatly enhances its user's mobility, whether reaching the frontlines or escaping unfavorable situations. However, while its new special weapon, Splashdown, could be impactful to its user's surroundings, it has limited application and can be countered by opponents.\n\nWhile the Splat Roller is a slayer's weapon, it is used differently from other, more conventional slayer's weapons, such as a Splattershot or a Slosher.\n\n- In Splatoon 2, the Splat Roller can be used in three different ways:\nTapping  while on the ground will swing the weapon horizontally, which flings a wide splash of ink. The horizontal swing is suitable for splatting opponents at close range and turfing areas that are slightly out of reach.\nTo swing horizontally while airborne, press  before pressing  to jump.\nTapping  while in midair will swing the weapon vertically, which flings a longer, narrower swath of ink. The vertical swing can poke at opponents who are either further back or up above and turf lanes through which to potentially travel.\nHolding down  while tilting  will push the Splat Roller along the ground, spreading ink along a wide area and damaging any opponents hit by it.\nWhile this is a thorough means of turfing, it is also slower than swimming (1.32 DU/f, or distance units per frame, versus 1.92 DU/f). For this reason, it is also not recommended to rely mainly on rolling to splat opponents. Use either the vertical swing or Curling Bombs (see below) to travel more quickly.\n\n- Tapping  while on the ground will swing the weapon horizontally, which flings a wide splash of ink.

For this reason, it is also not recommended to rely mainly on rolling to splat opponents. Use either the vertical swing or Curling Bombs (see below) to travel more quickly.\n\n- The damage inflicted by either the horizontal or vertical swing of any roller, including the Splat Roller depends on (1) which roller is being used, (2) the amount of Main Power Up equipped, and (3) the distance between the roller wielder and their target — the closer the target is, the more damage it will take.\n\n- Both the horizontal and vertical swings of each roller has three ranges: the lethal range, or the maximum range at which at least 100 HP of damage is inflicted; the two-hit range, which is the maximum range at which at least 50 HP of damage is delivered; and the maximum range, the absolute maximum range at which the roller can deal any damage.\nWith no Main Power Up equipped, the Splat Roller's horizontal swing has…\n…a lethal range of 80 DU, or slightly more than 1.5 distance lines away in the test range. This range is shorter than that of most other short-ranged weapons, such as both the Splattershot and the N-ZAP '85 (116.99 DU), the Splash-o-matic (110.03 DU), and even the Splattershot Jr. (103.89 DU).[9]\n…a two-hit range of about 100 DU, which is still shorter than the ranges of the other weapons listed above.\n…a maximum range of about 110 DU, at which a minimum damage of 35 HP is inflicted.\nInk flung from an angle greater than 30 degrees to either the left or right will lose damage starting from 28 DU and reach its minimum value at 100 DU. Therefore, aiming is still important when using the Splat Roller.\nDamage will suffer falloff to as little as 17.5 HP if the flung ink falls below the Splat Roller wielder. Thus, targets who are below a Splat Roller user will take less damage than those either above or on the same level.\nLikewise, the Splat Roller's vertical swing with no Main Power Up has…\n…a lethal range of 90 DU, or just shy of two distance lines away in the Shooting Range.\n…a two-hit range of about 120 DU, which is shorter than that of the .52 Gal (124.944 DU) and the Dark Tetra Dualies (132.5 DU).[9]\n…a maximum range of 155 DU – comparable to that of the Mini Splatling (130.1-154.1 DU),[9] at which the minimum damage is 40 HP.\nDamage will suffer falloff to as little as 20 HP if the flung ink falls below the Splat Roller user. Because a vertical swing requires a roller user to jump, falloff tends to affect the vertical swing more often than it affects the horizontal swing.\n\n- With no Main Power Up equipped, the Splat Roller's horizontal swing has…\n…a lethal range of 80 DU, or slightly more than 1.5 distance lines away in the test range.

Because a vertical swing requires a roller user to jump, falloff tends to affect the vertical swing more often than it affects the horizontal swing.\n\n- Because of its overall short range, slower fire rate than a shooter, and specific style of attacks, a Splat Roller user cannot expect to rush their opponents head-on and not get punished. Therefore, they will need to rely on both flanking and sharking more than a Splattershot user would.\nThe most ideal position a Splat Roller user can shark around is often just below the opponents' perch, where the Splat Roller user can hide, splat opponents who either drop down or get too close to the ledge, and poke at opponents atop the perch.\nWhile splatting an opponent or two is ideal during a flank attack, your main objective as a Splat Roller user flanking the opponent is to divert the opponents' collective attention away from the objective (e.g. the Splat Zone or the Tower and your teammates for as long as possible. Avoid getting splatted by hiding either within friendly ink or behind or underneath obstacles, such as a bumper, and ambush any opponents who fall within your range.\n\n- The most ideal position a Splat Roller user can shark around is often just below the opponents' perch, where the Splat Roller user can hide, splat opponents who either drop down or get too close to the ledge, and poke at opponents atop the perch.\n\n- While splatting an opponent or two is ideal during a flank attack, your main objective as a Splat Roller user flanking the opponent is to divert the opponents' collective attention away from the objective (e.g. the Splat Zone or the Tower and your teammates for as long as possible.

Avoid getting splatted by hiding either within friendly ink or behind or underneath obstacles, such as a bumper, and ambush any opponents who fall within your range.\n\nNew to Splatoon 2, the Curling Bomb adopts the sliding and ink trail-forming traits of the Seeker:\n\n- When it travels along any inkable non-vertical surface, it leaves a trail of ink behind, providing a quick avenue to either attack or escape. This trait enables a Vanilla Splat Roller user to be more mobile than users of other variants.\n\n- Keep opponents guessing by sending Curling Bombs towards the opponent without swimming in its trail. Either Ninja Squid or swimming slowly can help avoid detection while swimming in the ink trail.\n\n- It further assists the main weapon in turfing from a safe distance.\n\n- When charged, or \"cooked\" long enough, it can be used to lay insidious bomb traps to hold off pursuers or flush out sharks.\n\n- Particularly in narrow or closed areas, a Curling Bomb ricocheting off of walls can be a useful distraction to force an opponent to move in a certain direction.\n\nThe Splashdown can either turn the tide of a battle or be canceled quite easily.\n\n- The Splashdown can create combos of splash damage with the hits from the main weapon.\n\n- The safest way to execute a Splashdown is by super jumping to a teammate.\nUsing Super Jump can be a surprise for opponents that are not aware of the UI that indicates specials ready from the opponent team.\n\n- Using Super Jump can be a surprise for opponents that are not aware of the UI that indicates specials ready from the opponent team.\n\n- Most weapons can cancel the special mid-Splashdown, so it is best to make sure that the opponent you are confronting has a weapon that takes multiple shots for a splat or has low range.\n\n- The Splashdown can cancel formation of Bubbles making it a quick and fast way of removing them.\n\n- The Splashdown can be used from higher ledges making it more powerful and extending its radius of splash damage.\n\n- The worst scenario for a Splashdown is when used as a panic button to get out from a sticky situation, as it can be predicted and aimed for it to be canceled.\n\n- Using Super Jump can be a surprise for opponents that are not aware of the UI that indicates specials ready from the opponent team.\n\n- The lack of range of the Splat Roller prevents its wielder from effectively engaging opponents head-on. Therefore, the other three members of their team will each have to use weapons with enough range to contest and preoccupy opponents so that the Splat Roller user can catch them by surprise.\n\n- While Ink Armor can support almost any teammate, it will make players affected by it more visible within their ink. If a teammate has a build that includes Ink Armor, pay attention to the HUD to know when to expect an Ink Armor. Then, when the teammate activates it, play more aggressively than stealthily. Once the Ink Armor has ether worn off or been broken, revert to sharking tactics.\n\n- Any weapon with an effective range longer than the lethal range of the Splat Roller can counter an opposing Splat Roller wielder who attempts to challenge opponents head-on. However, most Splat Roller users worth their salt will rely more on flanking and sharking, so anyone facing a team with an opposing Splat Roller wielder must take a few proactive measures to avoid getting flanked or sharked:\nKeep track of all four members of the opposing team – which ones are present, which ones are splatted, and which ones are back at their spawn point.\nCheck the map periodically for opposing ink forming around flanks to anticipate a flanking attack.\nTo prevent sharking, check suspicious puddles of the opponents' ink, preferably with a thrown sub weapon.\nWeapons that track opponents, such as Point Sensors, temporarily prevent an opponent from sharking and makes them an easier target for long-ranged teammates to pick off.\nTry to confront an opposing Splat Roller user in a more open area, not only to have more space to avoid the lethal range of the Splat Roller but also to reduce the risk of getting splatted by any ricocheting Curling Bombs.\n\n- Keep track of all four members of the opposing team – which ones are present, which ones are splatted, and which ones are back at their spawn point.\n\n- Check the map periodically for opposing ink forming around flanks to anticipate a flanking attack.\n\n- To prevent sharking, check suspicious puddles of the opponents' ink, preferably with a thrown sub weapon.\n\n- Weapons that track opponents, such as Point Sensors, temporarily prevent an opponent from sharking and makes them an easier target for long-ranged teammates to pick off.\n\n- Try to confront an opposing Splat Roller user in a more open area, not only to have more space to avoid the lethal range of the Splat Roller but also to reduce the risk of getting splatted by any ricocheting Curling Bombs.\n\n- Keep an eye on the HUD to know when an opposing Splat Roller user has Splashdown ready to avoid getting caught by surprise, especially from a Splashdown after a super jump:\nIf an opposing Splat Roller user activates a Splashdown in an unsafe position, it can be canceled quite easily from fast firing weapons and chargers.\nThe opposing Splat Roller user might go for risky plays if they know they have the Splashdown ready as a safety net. It is possible to bait them to take control of an open space and surprise them with a teammate to force a mid-Splashdown situation and cancel it.\n\n- If an opposing Splat Roller user activates a Splashdown in an unsafe position, it can be canceled quite easily from fast firing weapons and chargers.\n\n- The opposing Splat Roller user might go for risky plays if they know they have the Splashdown ready as a safety net.

This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.\n\nAs a short-ranged slayer's weapon, the Splat Roller requires its user to be in close quarters with the opponent, who might be inclined to use bombs for zoning out the Splat Roller user. Ever since its introduction in version 4.3.0, Bomb Defense Up DX will not only reduce the damage taken from opposing sub and special weapons that are not one-hit-splat but will also reduce the duration of the tracking effects of certain opponent's sub and special weapons, such as Point Sensors and Ink Mines, allowing the user of this ability to evade detection more easily.\n\n- 3 ability points - one sub - has a lot of utility. This includes, but is not limited to:\nInk Armor will not break due to splash damage from bombs and other explosives that do 30 damage.\nTwo near-misses from Inkjet, two bumps from a Baller, and splash damage from two bubbles from Bubble Blower will not splat the user.\nGetting hit by splash damage from a bomb will not make the user visible on the map.\n\n- Ink Armor will not break due to splash damage from bombs and other explosives that do 30 damage.\n\n- Two near-misses from Inkjet, two bumps from a Baller, and splash damage from two bubbles from Bubble Blower will not splat the user.\n\n- Getting hit by splash damage from a bomb will not make the user visible on the map.\n\n- Ink Armor will not break due to splash damage from bombs and other explosives that do 30 damage.\n\n- Two near-misses from Inkjet, two bumps from a Baller, and splash damage from two bubbles from Bubble Blower will not splat the user.\n\n- Getting hit by splash damage from a bomb will not make the user visible on the map.\n\nAny good user of a short-ranged weapon like the Splat Roller is expected to come in contact with the opponent's ink on various surfaces, which can both be damaging and reduce mobility. Ink Resistance Up not only partially offsets the reduction in mobility but also delays the damage taken from contact with opposing ink.\n\nMain Power Up increases damage for the Splat Roller, improving consistency when it comes to splatting.\n\nAs a short-ranged weapon that excels at flanking, the Splat Roller greatly benefits if it is able to swim faster. Swim Speed Up enables its user to more quickly close the distance towards an opponent, more quickly respond to an opponents' push, or even escape unfavorable situations.\n\n- Swim Speed Up can reduce the swim speed penalty from Ninja Squid. However, it takes at least 20 ability points – two mains – of Swim Speed Up to fully offset the swimming speed penalty of Ninja Squid.[10]\n\n- Therefore, a Splat Roller user with Ninja Squid will have to decide between either having fewer ability points available for other abilities or swimming at less than the base maximum speed. For example, just 10 ability points – one main – are enough to restore the swim speed of a Splat Roller user with Ninja Squid to 1.83 units per frame.[10]\n\nNinja Squid reduces detection by opponents while swimming on non-vertical surfaces. It allows its user to swim at full speed undetected at the cost of about 20% of the maximum swimming speed as of version 3.0.0. Because a Splat Roller user has difficulty attacking most opponents head-on, Ninja Squid can make it easier for its user to shark and more safely approach opponents.\n\n- As of version 3.0.0, Ninja Squid reduces the maximum swim speed of the Splat Roller from 1.92 units per frame to 1.73 units per frame.[10]\n\nSuper Jumping to a teammate after respawning carries the risk of getting splatted upon landing, due to the appearance of a Super Jump indicator. When equipped, Stealth Jump better covers this indicator from long distance opponents, allowing its user to more safely return to the front lines and maintain pressure on the opponent.\n\nQuick Respawn shortens respawn time after getting splatted (under specific conditions), encouraging a Splat Roller user to remain aggressive even after getting splatted.\n\n- 26 ability points – two mains and two subs – are enough to reduce the respawn time from 8.5 seconds to 5.8 seconds.[10]\n\nReduces ink consumption for Curling Bombs, which are the Splat Roller's main approach tool.\n\nNot recommended. Due to the Splat Roller's sharking playstyle, it will spend a sizable amount of time swimming in ink - which refills the ink tank. Ink Saver (Sub) should be invested into instead.\n\nNot recommended, as Splashdown is already 170p and not worth investing into.\n[11]\n\nThe Splat Roller (and the Order Roller Replica) keeps the Curling Bomb from its Splatoon 2 weapon set as a movement tool. Its new special weapon, Big Bubbler, synergizes very well with the main weapon's wide, lethal hitbox, enabling its user to deny their opponents turf for a considerable amount of time.\n\nWhile mostly renowned as a sharking slayer thanks to its one-hit-splat, wide hitbox, and great ledge-camping, the Splat Roller also has the tools to flex into a skirmisher:[1][2][3][4]\n\n- The horizontal swing (tap  while on the ground) is lethal at short range (within 7.2 distance units, or DU), has a wide hitbox, and flings a wide splash of ink:\nWhile its hitbox is wider than that of the vertical one, the portions that are over 16° off center are less damaging. Therefore, keep your targets directly in front of you as you swing the Splat Roller.\nFor maximum damage against targets at your elevation, aim the Splat Roller slightly downward.\nTo hit targets that are either just above you or behind an obstacle, aim the Splat Roller upward.\nTapping  then  allows you to swing the Splat Roller horizontally while airborne. This adds another movement option, gives your shots a better trajectory, and further improves your ledge camping.\n\n- While its hitbox is wider than that of the vertical one, the portions that are over 16° off center are less damaging.

This adds another movement option, gives your shots a better trajectory, and further improves your ledge camping.\n\n- The vertical swing (tap  then ) has a longer range (including a longer lethal range at 8.2 DU) at the cost of a slower speed and a narrower hitbox:\nIts range exceeds that of some short-ranged shooters, allowing you to poke at and space out some opponents.\nThe extra range also extends the reach of the Splat Roller's already great ledge-camping.\n\n- Its range exceeds that of some short-ranged shooters, allowing you to poke at and space out some opponents.\n\n- The extra range also extends the reach of the Splat Roller's already great ledge-camping.\n\n- Rolling (hold  while tilting ) is less reliable at splatting, turfing, or movement, but it has a few niche uses:\nIf you are right next to an opponent after swinging (e.g., after a miss), rolling can finish them off, particularly if your are short on either time or ink.\nRolling is a Splat Roller user's most effective way to punish Super Jumpers, especially dualie users (who can dodge roll) and users equipped with Drop Roll.\nRolling is also effective at splatting opponents using certain special weapons, such as Ink Vac and Ultra Stamp. While this might get you splatted, trading out these opponents could save the rest of your team.\nRolling is another movement option when your ink tank is too low for either a Curling Bomb or another swing, especially when being poked at by an opposing area of effect- (AoE-) style weapon user down a ledge or around a corner.\nIt is also possible to squid roll after rolling, adding yet another movement option to escape danger.\nJumping while rolling next to an inkable wall will ink it, offering a quick means of climbing some obstacles.\n\n- If you are right next to an opponent after swinging (e.g., after a miss), rolling can finish them off, particularly if your are short on either time or ink.\n\n- Rolling is a Splat Roller user's most effective way to punish Super Jumpers, especially dualie users (who can dodge roll) and users equipped with Drop Roll.\n\n- Rolling is also effective at splatting opponents using certain special weapons, such as Ink Vac and Ultra Stamp.

Rely on flanking as well as sharking to approach opponents outside of their visual field.\n\n- Its slow fire rate enables many of its user's opponents to splat them in about the same amount of time or less (table below). To ensure a clean splat (instead of a trade), generally attack opponents who are distracted and strike them quickly before they can fire a shot at you.\n\n- While capable of turfing enough to capture or retain a Splat Zone (with the aid of a Big Bubbler, see below), the Splat Roller's low ink efficiency contributes to a longer downtime than that of most shooters and dualies and fewer opportunities to use Curling Bombs—particularly as an escape option.\n\nWhile the Curling Bomb is primarily a movement tool for a Splat Roller user, it has a few other practical uses:[1][2][12]\n\n- It quickly paves an ink path through which its user can travel, whether to advance, flank, or retreat.\nIts instant deployment (in contrast to the slow windup of the main weapon) can offset its higher ink consumption.\nYou can use it with Ninja Squid to play mind games with opponents over whether and when you follow its ink trail for a quick splat. This is more effective against opponents using poor-turfing weapons, such as blasters.\n\n- Its instant deployment (in contrast to the slow windup of the main weapon) can offset its higher ink consumption.\n\n- You can use it with Ninja Squid to play mind games with opponents over whether and when you follow its ink trail for a quick splat. This is more effective against opponents using poor-turfing weapons, such as blasters.\n\n- Its damage upon contact (20 HP), while low, can finish off nearby opponents weakened by an off-center horizontal swing (if the required ink is available).\n\n- If an opponent is suspected to be ledge-camping, a Curling Bomb (charged if necessary) can flush them out, but be wary of the opponent's attacks (e.g., AoE).\n\n- Depending on the surface geometry, it can sometimes be used to poke at the opponent's position:\nParticularly in narrow or closed areas, a Curling Bomb ricocheting off of walls can be a useful distraction to force an opponent to move in a certain direction.\nWhile ledge-camping, you can throw a Curling Bomb over certain walls and ledges by standing very close it then throwing it over at maximum jump height.[13]\n\n- Particularly in narrow or closed areas, a Curling Bomb ricocheting off of walls can be a useful distraction to force an opponent to move in a certain direction.\n\n- While ledge-camping, you can throw a Curling Bomb over certain walls and ledges by standing very close it then throwing it over at maximum jump height.[13]\n\n- Both the ink trail and the resulting explosion provide turf for farming Tacticooler.\nA Curling Bomb can also ink a spot on a wall more quickly than swinging the main weapon, helping to quickly climb some walls.\n\n- A Curling Bomb can also ink a spot on a wall more quickly than swinging the main weapon, helping to quickly climb some walls.\n\n- Its instant deployment (in contrast to the slow windup of the main weapon) can offset its higher ink consumption.\n\n- You can use it with Ninja Squid to play mind games with opponents over whether and when you follow its ink trail for a quick splat.

Just take care not to get splatted by opposing fire before the Bubbler activates.\nPlanting the Big Bubbler so that the generator on top is positioned behind an obstacle can better protect it from opposing fire. Just be mindful of any ceilings above, which can prevent the barrier from reaching full size.\nThe Splat Roller's wide hitbox ensures its user that few opponents can enter their Big Bubbler and challenge them, so long as no opponents are flanking or sharking.\n\n- A Curling Bomb can help a Splat Roller user set up their Big Bubbler further forward.

Reefslider can also instantly destroy a Big Bubbler by running over it.\nA Big Bubbler cannot block the opponents' Booyah Bomb explosion, Wave Breaker shockwaves, Killer Wail 5.1, or Triple Inkstrike, so be aware if the opponent has them.\n\n- Opponents using Zipcaster, Ultra Stamp's swing mode, Reefslider, and Kraken Royale can cross the barrier and splat a Big Bubbler user.

Remember that your teammates can also benefit from it:\nTeammates within the Big Bubbler, especially splatling users, have less to fear from opposing charger users and some other long-ranged threats, such as Trizookas.\nEven though the Big Bubbler cannot move, it can be placed onto the Tower itself and can move as the Tower moves and clears checkpoints. Note that the durations of special weapons on the Tower are cut in half, so it is best to activate Big Bubbler just before opponents open fire on the Tower.\nPlanting a Big Bubbler in front of an opponents' Rainmaker pedestal (checkpoint or goal) or clam basket better ensures that a teammate can safely bring the objective there.\n\n- Teammates within the Big Bubbler, especially splatling users, have less to fear from opposing charger users and some other long-ranged threats, such as Trizookas.\n\n- Even though the Big Bubbler cannot move, it can be placed onto the Tower itself and can move as the Tower moves and clears checkpoints.

If its user or a teammate stands inside of it, they will be immune to direct damage, similar to showering beneath one's own Splash Wall in the original Splatoon. However, splash damage might still be damaging.\n\n- A Curling Bomb can help a Splat Roller user set up their Big Bubbler further forward.

The ability allows the Splat Roller to escape dire situations, quickly reposition, and stay alive, offsetting the weapon's poor mobility.[18]\n\n- 19 AP, or a main and three subs, reduces the startup time of a Super Jump from 80 frames to 34 frames, or just over half a second, and reduces the overall Super Jump time from 3.633 seconds to 2.767 seconds."
