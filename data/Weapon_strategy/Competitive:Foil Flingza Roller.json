  "content": "Like the Flingza Roller, the Foil Flingza Roller combines a long-range vertical swing akin to that of the Dynamo Roller with a short-range horizontal swing similar to that of the Splat Roller. However, the cost of this flexibility is a lack of damage potential, meaning that, just like its Vanilla variant, it needs to be played differently than other rollers.\n\nThe Foil Flingza Roller's traits and kit make it suitable for a support role:\n\n- Like other rollers in Splatoon 2, it has a horizontal and a vertical swing. However, unlike other rollers, both variants of the Flingza Roller have a quick (42 frames), short-ranged horizontal swing and a slow (70 frames), long-ranged vertical swing:\nWithout assistance from Main Power Up, the horizontal swing has…\n…a lethal range of 80 DU,…\n…a two-hit range of about 100 DU,…\n…and a maximum range of about 110 DU, at which the minimum damage is 30 HP.\nInk flung from an angle greater than 25 degrees to either the left or right will lose damage starting from 28 DU and reach its minimum value at 90 DU. Even more so than with the Splat Roller, aiming is important when using a Flingza Roller.\nAs with other rollers, damage will suffer falloff to as little as 15 HP if the flung ink falls below the Flingza Roller wielder. Thus, targets who are below a Flingza Roller user will take less damage than those either above or on the same level.\nOverall, the Flingza Roller's horizontal swing is less consistent in delivering damage than the Splat Roller. While it can be used with similar tactics as those intended for a Splat Roller, such as sharking just below the opponents' perch, note that it will not be as reliable in splatting opponents.\nIn contrast, the vertical swing has…\n…a lethal range of 105 DU,…\n…a two-hit range of 145 DU,…\n…and a maximum range of 205, at which the minimum damage is 40.\nDamage will suffer falloff to as little as 20 HP if the flung ink falls below the Flingza Roller user. Because a vertical swing requires a roller user to jump, falloff tends to affect the vertical swing more often than it affects the horizontal swing.\nBecause all of these ranges pale in comparison to those of the Dynamo Roller (130 DU, 200 DU, and 240 DU), a Flingza Roller's vertical swing is not as capable of suppressing the opponents' movement or punishing over-extension. It can still turf large swaths of territory to create lanes or build up the special gauge and provide support fire for teammates from afar.\n\n- Without assistance from Main Power Up, the horizontal swing has…\n…a lethal range of 80 DU,…\n…a two-hit range of about 100 DU,…\n…and a maximum range of about 110 DU, at which the minimum damage is 30 HP.\nInk flung from an angle greater than 25 degrees to either the left or right will lose damage starting from 28 DU and reach its minimum value at 90 DU.

It can still turf large swaths of territory to create lanes or build up the special gauge and provide support fire for teammates from afar.\n\n- Besides less consistent damage, the other weakness of the Foil Fingza Roller is its relative lack of mobility:\nWhile it possesses a useful and versatile sub weapon in Suction Bombs (see below), they do not boost their user's mobility as do Burst Bombs (with the Carbon Roller Deco), Curling Bombs (with the Splat Roller), or Fizzy Bombs.\nThe Foil Flingza Roller's most reliable means of turfing is through its slow, high ink consuming vertical swing, which can be a problem if an opponent were to rush you down. Avoid getting surrounded by opposing ink and know when it is time to flee via Super Jumping.\n\n- While it possesses a useful and versatile sub weapon in Suction Bombs (see below), they do not boost their user's mobility as do Burst Bombs (with the Carbon Roller Deco), Curling Bombs (with the Splat Roller), or Fizzy Bombs.\n\n- The Foil Flingza Roller's most reliable means of turfing is through its slow, high ink consuming vertical swing, which can be a problem if an opponent were to rush you down.

Avoid getting surrounded by opposing ink and know when it is time to flee via Super Jumping.\n\nSuction Bombs can be used in a similar fashion to Splat Bombs, with a few differences:\n\n- They can attach to surfaces, which both allows more room for error when aiming and enables the planting of craftier traps, such as underneath a grate.\n\n- They take two seconds after attaching to a surface to detonate, as opposed to one second for a Splat Bomb, so plant Suction Bombs earlier than usual.\n\n- They inflict more damage from a direct hit (220 HP) and have a larger overall radius of damage (80 DU).\n\n- They can be thrown to lead a push into a Splat Zone or any other important area of the stage, such as the opponents' street or platform.\n\n- They can also flush out opposing anchors from perches and clear other critical areas, such as the Tower.[3]\n\n- They can also be used to poke at and zone out opponents during the neutral phase, stall an opponent's push, or provide space to escape.\n\n- A Suction Bomb can damage or destroy an opponent's brella shield, Splash Wall, or Baller or the Rainmaker shield, while detonating on contact.\nAny opponents caught within the Suction Bomb's explosion will get damaged or splatted.[4]\nIt will also inflate or pop a teammate's bubbles but deflate or diffuse an opponent's bubbles, while still detonating on contact.[5]\n\n- Any opponents caught within the Suction Bomb's explosion will get damaged or splatted.[4]\n\n- It will also inflate or pop a teammate's bubbles but deflate or diffuse an opponent's bubbles, while still detonating on contact.[5]\n\n- An opponent's Splashdown or Booyah Bomb will defuse any Suction Bombs it touches, so hold off throwing them until after the special weapon finishes.\n\n- Any opponents caught within the Suction Bomb's explosion will get damaged or splatted.[4]\n\n- It will also inflate or pop a teammate's bubbles but deflate or diffuse an opponent's bubbles, while still detonating on contact.[5]\n\nTenta Missiles can be used to locate and pressure opponents and force them out of position without having to commit too far forward:\n\n- It is recommended to only activate the Tenta Missiles at a safe distance from opponents, not only because a Tenta Missile user is vulnerable to close-range attacks but also because opponents who are further back are easier to track and home missiles on.\n\n- Sometimes, it may be more beneficial to target a specific opponent or two instead of all of them, based on their weapons, location, and situation:[6]\nOpponents wielding heavy, slow firing weapons will have a harder time escaping the missiles.\nOpponents who are bunched together are more likely to cause their teammates to receive collateral damage than those who are spread apart.\nTenta Missiles are also a reliable means of forcing opposing anchors to cede their ground and lose focus while aiming.[7] Sometimes, this is the only reliable means to push back into a zone or another important area of the stage.\nTenta Missiles can counter an opponent's Sting Ray or Booyah Bomb if anticipated early enough; an opponent will be forced to either delay or interrupt it to avoid getting splatted by the missiles, throwing off their aim.[8]\n\n- Opponents wielding heavy, slow firing weapons will have a harder time escaping the missiles.\n\n- Opponents who are bunched together are more likely to cause their teammates to receive collateral damage than those who are spread apart.\n\n- Tenta Missiles are also a reliable means of forcing opposing anchors to cede their ground and lose focus while aiming.[7] Sometimes, this is the only reliable means to push back into a zone or another important area of the stage.\n\n- Tenta Missiles can counter an opponent's Sting Ray or Booyah Bomb if anticipated early enough; an opponent will be forced to either delay or interrupt it to avoid getting splatted by the missiles, throwing off their aim.[8]\n\n- Opponents wielding heavy, slow firing weapons will have a harder time escaping the missiles.\n\n- Opponents who are bunched together are more likely to cause their teammates to receive collateral damage than those who are spread apart.\n\n- Tenta Missiles are also a reliable means of forcing opposing anchors to cede their ground and lose focus while aiming.[7] Sometimes, this is the only reliable means to push back into a zone or another important area of the stage.\n\n- Tenta Missiles can counter an opponent's Sting Ray or Booyah Bomb if anticipated early enough; an opponent will be forced to either delay or interrupt it to avoid getting splatted by the missiles, throwing off their aim.[8]\n\nWhile the Foil Flingza Roller has a means of attacking from long range, it is not reliable enough to be treated as a long-ranged weapon. It is more effective at close range when its user has to splat opponents and should be treated as a short-ranged weapon. While a team might get away with having one or two users of short-ranged weapons, having a team composition with too many short-ranged weapons and no longer-ranged weapons to provide support fire is often disadvantageous for a number of reasons:[9]\n\n- An opponent with a long-ranged weapon can more aggressively position themselves to zone out the entire shorter-ranged team.\n\n- The opposing slayers can play more aggressively, knowing that there is no long-ranged threat to pick them off from afar.\n\nWhile having multiple players on the same team launching Tenta Missiles might seem like a fun and easy means to cause opponents to scramble for cover, having too many players equipped with them – no more than one or two – can reduce the effectiveness of a team composition:[9]\n\n- Other special weapons, such as Inkjet or Sting Ray, are intended for splatting opponents and more capable at this than are Tenta Missiles.\n\n- Tenta Missiles cannot reliably turf highly contested areas of the stage as well as certain other special weapons, such as Bomb Launcher or Ink Storm.\n\nCoordinating with your teammates can greatly increase the Tenta Missiles' effect during a battle:\n\n- Launching Tenta Missiles just before a push can cause opponents to scatter, giving your team opportunities to pick off any opponents caught fleeing the Missiles.\n\n- Firing Tenta Missiles on defense can help stall an opponent's push, but make sure that your teammates are nearby the front lines to follow the Missiles up.\n\n- Launching Tenta Missiles while a teammate is using a special designed to splat opponents, such as Sting Ray or Inkjet, can limit the opponents' escape options and even prevent them from Super Jumping to safety.\n\n- Bomb Defense Up DX reduces the splash damage from both Suction Bombs (from 30 HP to 28.6 HP) and Tenta Missiles (from 50 HP to 48.3 HP),[10] improving its user's survivability against both the sub and special weapons of an opposing Slosher user.[11][12]\n\n- Any weapon with an effective range longer than the lethal range of the Foil Flingza Roller can counter an opposing Foil Flingza wielder who attempts to challenge opponents head-on. However, if an aggressive Foil Flingza user relies on flanking or sharking, take a few proactive measures to avoid getting caught unaware:\nKeep track of all four members of the opposing team – which ones are present, which ones are splatted, and which ones are back at their spawn point.\nCheck the map periodically for opposing ink forming around flanks to anticipate a flanking attack.\nTo prevent sharking, check suspicious puddles of the opponents' ink, preferably with a thrown sub weapon.\nWeapons that track opponents, such as Point Sensors, temporarily prevent an opponent from sharking and makes them an easier target for long-ranged teammates to pick off.\nTry to confront an opposing Foil Flingza Roller user in a more open area to have more space to avoid their lethal range.\n\n- Keep track of all four members of the opposing team – which ones are present, which ones are splatted, and which ones are back at their spawn point.\n\n- Check the map periodically for opposing ink forming around flanks to anticipate a flanking attack.\n\n- To prevent sharking, check suspicious puddles of the opponents' ink, preferably with a thrown sub weapon.\n\n- Weapons that track opponents, such as Point Sensors, temporarily prevent an opponent from sharking and makes them an easier target for long-ranged teammates to pick off.\n\n- Try to confront an opposing Foil Flingza Roller user in a more open area to have more space to avoid their lethal range.\n\n- Be mindful of both when the opponent has Tenta Missiles ready and when the missiles are launched:\nIf an opponent attempts to launch them when nearby you, splat them quickly to reduce or even cancel their deployment.\nWhen the opponent deploys their Tenta Missiles, avoid getting close to teammates - even when not targeted, as a targeted player crossing paths with a teammate might cause the other to get injured or splatted.\nWhenever targeted by opposing Tenta Missiles, unless actively engaging an opponent, only move enough to avoid damage and reduce the amount of turfing by the Missiles.[13]\n\n- If an opponent attempts to launch them when nearby you, splat them quickly to reduce or even cancel their deployment.\n\n- When the opponent deploys their Tenta Missiles, avoid getting close to teammates - even when not targeted, as a targeted player crossing paths with a teammate might cause the other to get injured or splatted.\n\n- Whenever targeted by opposing Tenta Missiles, unless actively engaging an opponent, only move enough to avoid damage and reduce the amount of turfing by the Missiles.[13]\n\n- Keep track of all four members of the opposing team – which ones are present, which ones are splatted, and which ones are back at their spawn point.\n\n- Check the map periodically for opposing ink forming around flanks to anticipate a flanking attack.\n\n- To prevent sharking, check suspicious puddles of the opponents' ink, preferably with a thrown sub weapon.\n\n- Weapons that track opponents, such as Point Sensors, temporarily prevent an opponent from sharking and makes them an easier target for long-ranged teammates to pick off.\n\n- Try to confront an opposing Foil Flingza Roller user in a more open area to have more space to avoid their lethal range.\n\n- If an opponent attempts to launch them when nearby you, splat them quickly to reduce or even cancel their deployment.\n\n- When the opponent deploys their Tenta Missiles, avoid getting close to teammates - even when not targeted, as a targeted player crossing paths with a teammate might cause the other to get injured or splatted.\n\n- Whenever targeted by opposing Tenta Missiles, unless actively engaging an opponent, only move enough to avoid damage and reduce the amount of turfing by the Missiles.[13]\n\nGear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.\n\nThe Foil Flingza Roller uses a large portion of the ink tank per swing. Ink Saver (Main) not only allows its user to swing more often per ink tank but also conserves ink for Suction Bomb use.[11]\n\n- Six ability points, or two subs, of Ink Saver (Main) are enough to increase both the number of horizontal swings from 12.5 to 13.66 and the number of vertical swings from 8.33 to 9.1.\n\n- Thirteen ability points, or one main and one sub, increases the number of horizontal swings to 15.11 and vertical swings to 10.07.[14]\n\nInk Saver (Sub) allows more frequent use of Suction Bombs and saves ink for the main weapon after each Suction Bomb used. Having the ability to use Suction Bombs more often allows a Foil Flingza Roller user to more reliably slow the opponents' push.[11] For example, constantly tossing Suction Bombs onto the Tower can force opponents off of it, delaying their Tower push.\n\n- 13 ability points, or one main and one sub, reduces the ink requirement per Suction Bomb to just above 60.6% for a Foil Flingza Roller user.\n\nLast-Ditch Effort is a headgear-exclusive ability that, under specific conditions, grants its user 1 to 24 ability points each of the following abilities:\n\n- Ink Saver (Main)\n\n- Ink Saver (Sub)\n\n- Ink Recovery Up\n\nThese abilities only begin to take effect under either of the following conditions:\n\n- There are at most 30 seconds remaining on the game clock, or Overtime has begun in a Ranked Battle, at which the maximum 24 ability points will be granted for each of the above abilities.\n\n- In a Ranked Battle, the opposing team's countdown has at most 50 points remaining. The effects of Last-Ditch Effort increase as the opposing team's countdown decreases from 50 to 30 points remaining, starting with 1 ability point for each ability and maxing out to 24 ability points.\n\nA Foil Flingza Roller user benefits from both the overall reduced ink consumption and quicker ink recovery, allowing them to more freely use either the main weapon or Suction Bombs during either a crucial defensive stand or a late attempt to reclaim the lead.[11]\n\nIntroduced in version 4.3.0, Main Power Up increases the damage output of the Foil Flingza Roller by up to 15%. While the Foil Flingza Roller does not benefit as greatly from Main Power Up as do some other weapons — notably the Splattershot Pro and its variants, it can improve both its damage consistency and effective ranges with a little investment in this ability.[11]\n\n- Nine ability points – achievable with either three subs or one main – increases the damage output of a Foil Flingza Roller by at least 7.05%.\n\n- Fifteen ability points – achievable with either five subs or one main and two subs – increases the damage output by at least 9.21%.\n\nQuick Super Jump decreases both the \"charge\" time before and the travel time of a Super Jump. A Foil Flingza Roller user will benefit since Quick Super Jump allows them to escape unfavorable situations more easily to preserve special gauge progress.[11][12]\n\n- One sub, or 3 ability points, of Quick Super Jump decreases the \"charge\" time by 22 frames, or 0.36 seconds.[14]\n\nSpecial Charge Up accelerates building up the special gauge for Tenta Missiles. As one of the quickest weapons at farming Tenta Missiles, constantly having them available to pressure opponents ensures more successful pushes and counter-pushes.[11]\n\n- 16 ability points – one main and two subs – are enough to reduce the special gauge requirement to below 160p.[14]\n\nWhen splatted, half of the special gauge progress is lost. For example, a player with 120p of special gauge out of 180p upon getting splatted will lose 60p of the special gauge. Special Saver allows its user to keep more of their special gauge progress whenever they are splatted. This allows a Foil Flingza Roller user to more quickly build up Tenta Missiles after respawning.[11][12]\n\n- 6 ability points – two subs – are enough to increase the amount of special gauge progress saved from 50% to 64.6%.[14]\n\nThe Foil Flingza Roller is both short-ranged and lacks mobility, so any improvements to its swimming speed will help its user tremendously. Swim Speed Up enables its user to more quickly close the distance towards an opponent, more quickly respond to an opponents' push, and – most importantly for the Foil Flingza Roller user – escape unfavorable situations.[11]\n\n- 16 ability points – one main and two subs – increase the swim speed from 1.92 to 2.14 units per frame.\n\n- Swim Speed Up can reduce the swim speed penalty from Ninja Squid. However, it takes at least 20 ability points – two mains – of Swim Speed Up to fully offset the swimming speed penalty of Ninja Squid.\n\n- Therefore, a Foil Flingza Roller user with Ninja Squid will have to decide between either having fewer ability points available for other abilities or swimming at less than the base maximum speed. For example, just 10 ability points – one main – are enough to restore the swim speed of a Foil Flingza Roller user with Ninja Squid to 1.83 units per frame.[14][15]"
