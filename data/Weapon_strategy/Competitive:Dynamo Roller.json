Compared to the other two variants, its kit allows for a more defensive playstyle with a Sting Ray almost always readily available to stop an enemy push.\n\nWhile the turfing ability of the Dynamo Roller suggests it to be a support weapon, its long range allows it to find success as an anchor as well:\n\n- Its heavy damage enables it – sometimes with the help from Main Power Up – to destroy certain protective special weapons in one hit, such as Ink Armor and Baller.[2]\n\n- As with other rollers in Splatoon 2, one can now vary how to swing the Dynamo Roller: horizontally when on the ground and vertically when in midair.\nTo perform a horizontal swing while jumping, press  first, then press .\nTo perform a horizontal swing after a jump or drop, wait until you land before pressing .\n\n- To perform a horizontal swing while jumping, press  first, then press .\n\n- To perform a horizontal swing after a jump or drop, wait until you land before pressing .\n\n- The long range of its swings – particularly the vertical swing – can reach over some obstacles, poke at and pressure opponents[5], even swat opposing Inkjet pilots in midair![6]\n\n- It can turf large areas with the horizontal swing and long swaths with the vertical one to create paths to swim along, all while quickly building up the special gauge.\n\n- To perform a horizontal swing while jumping, press  first, then press .\n\n- To perform a horizontal swing after a jump or drop, wait until you land before pressing .\n\nSpacing and positioning are critical when wielding the Dynamo Roller, so learn its various effective ranges for both the horizontal and vertical swings — the lethal range (the maximum range at which at least 100 HP of damage is inflicted), the two-hit range (the maximum range at which at least 50 HP of damage is delivered), and the maximum range:\n\n- Without the benefit of Main Power Up, the longer-reaching vertical swing has…\n…a lethal range of 130 DU, exceeding most short-ranged weapons, such as the Splattershot and the N-ZAP '85 (116.99 DU[7]).\n…a two-hit range of about 200 DU, which is much longer than that of the Kensa Splattershot Pro, the H-3 Nozzlenose D, and the Custom Dualie Squelchers (all 160.396 DU[7]) and just longer than that of the Bamboozler 14 Mk I (195.64 DU[7]).\n…a maximum range of about 240 DU, exceeding that of the Heavy Splatling (178.05-218.37 DU[7]) and the Ballpoint Splatling (225.04-237.094 DU[7]).\n\n- …a lethal range of 130 DU, exceeding most short-ranged weapons, such as the Splattershot and the N-ZAP '85 (116.99 DU[7]).\n\n- …a two-hit range of about 200 DU, which is much longer than that of the Kensa Splattershot Pro, the H-3 Nozzlenose D, and the Custom Dualie Squelchers (all 160.396 DU[7]) and just longer than that of the Bamboozler 14 Mk I (195.64 DU[7]).\n\n- …a maximum range of about 240 DU, exceeding that of the Heavy Splatling (178.05-218.37 DU[7]) and the Ballpoint Splatling (225.04-237.094 DU[7]).\n\n- While not as long-ranged, the horizontal swing still has…\n…a lethal range of 110 DU, nearly matching that of the Splash-o-matic (110.03 DU[7]).\n…a two-hit range of about 165 DU, longer than that of the L-3 Nozzlenose (141.36 DU[7]) and the Mini Splatling (130.1-154.1 DU[7]).\n…a maximum range of about 185 DU, which is just shy of the burst fire mode of the Squeezer (187.39 DU[7]).\n\n- …a lethal range of 110 DU, nearly matching that of the Splash-o-matic (110.03 DU[7]).\n\n- …a two-hit range of about 165 DU, longer than that of the L-3 Nozzlenose (141.36 DU[7]) and the Mini Splatling (130.1-154.1 DU[7]).\n\n- …a maximum range of about 185 DU, which is just shy of the burst fire mode of the Squeezer (187.39 DU[7]).\n\n- By increasing the damage output of both swings, Main Power Up can slightly increase these various ranges.\n\n- Because of the Dynamo Roller's low mobility and long lag between swings, it is more effective in both suppressing the opponents' movement and punishing those who overextend than in pursuing them. Thus, it is usually best to remain a distance around the two-hit range from an opponent and only exploit the lethal damage should they come within the lethal range.\n\n- …a lethal range of 130 DU, exceeding most short-ranged weapons, such as the Splattershot and the N-ZAP '85 (116.99 DU[7]).\n\n- …a two-hit range of about 200 DU, which is much longer than that of the Kensa Splattershot Pro, the H-3 Nozzlenose D, and the Custom Dualie Squelchers (all 160.396 DU[7]) and just longer than that of the Bamboozler 14 Mk I (195.64 DU[7]).\n\n- …a maximum range of about 240 DU, exceeding that of the Heavy Splatling (178.05-218.37 DU[7]) and the Ballpoint Splatling (225.04-237.094 DU[7]).\n\n- …a lethal range of 110 DU, nearly matching that of the Splash-o-matic (110.03 DU[7]).\n\n- …a two-hit range of about 165 DU, longer than that of the L-3 Nozzlenose (141.36 DU[7]) and the Mini Splatling (130.1-154.1 DU[7]).\n\n- …a maximum range of about 185 DU, which is just shy of the burst fire mode of the Squeezer (187.39 DU[7]).\n\nAs already mentioned, the Dynamo Roller has a few glaring drawbacks, including its aforementioned lack of mobility and slow fire rate:\n\n- The heavyweight nature of the Dynamo Roller slows its user down to a run speed of 0.88 DU/f[8], a swim speed of 1.73 DU/f[8], and a run speed of 0.24 DU/f while swinging the weapon, making a Dynamo Roller user an easy target for an opponent wielding a long-ranged weapon, especially a charger.\n\n- The Dynamo Roller is also very slow to wield, taking 65 frames – just over a second – to swing horizontally and 80 frames – 1.33 seconds – to swing vertically.\nThis long lag between swings makes a Dynamo Roller user vulnerable at close range to rapid firing weapons.\nOnce  is pressed, a Dynamo Roller user is committed to swinging their weapon and cannot cancel the swing by any means except for Super Jumping. Therefore, be aware of your surroundings (i.e. be wary of opposing chargers, flanks, and sharks) and do not swing the weapon without a good purpose.\n\n- This long lag between swings makes a Dynamo Roller user vulnerable at close range to rapid firing weapons.\n\n- Once  is pressed, a Dynamo Roller user is committed to swinging their weapon and cannot cancel the swing by any means except for Super Jumping. Therefore, be aware of your surroundings (i.e. be wary of opposing chargers, flanks, and sharks) and do not swing the weapon without a good purpose.\n\n- The Dynamo Roller also consumes plenty of ink per swing (18% – equal to that of a Splat Charger), only capable of five swings before needing to refill.\nThis makes it dependent on ink-conserving and ink-recovering abilities in order to function optimally.\nCombined with its low mobility and long lag between swings, this also makes the Dynamo Roller user an especially vulnerable target whenever they are surrounded by opposing ink, such as after getting hit by a Burst Bomb or a shot from an Explosher.\nKeep an eye on the ink tank and avoid traveling too far in turf covered by the opponents' ink.\n\n- This makes it dependent on ink-conserving and ink-recovering abilities in order to function optimally.\n\n- Combined with its low mobility and long lag between swings, this also makes the Dynamo Roller user an especially vulnerable target whenever they are surrounded by opposing ink, such as after getting hit by a Burst Bomb or a shot from an Explosher.\n\n- Keep an eye on the ink tank and avoid traveling too far in turf covered by the opponents' ink.\n\n- This long lag between swings makes a Dynamo Roller user vulnerable at close range to rapid firing weapons.\n\n- Once  is pressed, a Dynamo Roller user is committed to swinging their weapon and cannot cancel the swing by any means except for Super Jumping.

This makes them useful to place on flank routes as it will be easier to see them coming.\n\n- Ink Mines also deal damage to nearby opponents when triggered, doing either 45 damage when the opponent is near or 35 damage in other cases. Placing them in areas with heavy traffic will deal some damage to the opponents, softening them up for easier splats.\nThis is also particularly useful for the Dynamo Roller, allowing it to splat opponents from farther away due to the added damage the Ink Mines deal.\n\n- This is also particularly useful for the Dynamo Roller, allowing it to splat opponents from farther away due to the added damage the Ink Mines deal.\n\n- They can be placed on the objective, most notably a Splat Zone, to stall any opponents trying to recapture it for a short time. Opponents trying to paint over the zone will detonate the mine, meaning they have to spend more time painting it. If the opponent manages to recapture the zone without triggering any Ink Mines, they will still explode, which can potentially neutralize it.\n\n- This is also particularly useful for the Dynamo Roller, allowing it to splat opponents from farther away due to the added damage the Ink Mines deal.\n\nThe Sting Ray is an infinitely long distance weapon that can penetrate obstacles and damage opponents from afar:\n\n- It can limit the opponents' mobility when used in coordination with teammates, making it easier for teammates to splat them.\n\n- The Dynamo Roller has the lowest special gauge requirement (180p) among all other Sting Ray-based weapons, along with the Custom Jet Squelcher. Combined with its solid turfing, a Dynamo Roller user will often have Sting Ray available compared to other Sting Ray-based weapons.\n\n- Before starting the Sting Ray, it is advised to keep a safe distance from battles, as firing a Sting Ray too close to an opponent can leave one vulnerable to attack.\n\n- When firing the Sting Ray, if an opponent escapes from the ray, bring up the map with . An opponent who has taken any damage will be visible on the map until completely healed. Redirect the Sting Ray until the popping sound is heard.\n\n- When fired at certain objectives in Ranked Battle — namely the Tower, the Rainmaker, or an opponent's Power Clam, Sting Ray can help stall the opponents' push. However, it often pays to wait for teammates to be nearby the objective to secure it before firing the Sting Ray.\n\n- While thought of as a defensive, or stalling special weapon, Sting Ray can also be used to great effect on offense:\nRestraining or eliminating opponents who attempt to attack your teammate tasked with the objective (Tower, Rainmaker, Power Clam).\nEliminating or distracting the opposing anchor, preventing them from providing support fire on defense.\n\n- Restraining or eliminating opponents who attempt to attack your teammate tasked with the objective (Tower, Rainmaker, Power Clam).\n\n- Eliminating or distracting the opposing anchor, preventing them from providing support fire on defense.\n\n- Restraining or eliminating opponents who attempt to attack your teammate tasked with the objective (Tower, Rainmaker, Power Clam).\n\n- Eliminating or distracting the opposing anchor, preventing them from providing support fire on defense.\n\nThe Dynamo Roller has great range and thorough turfing but is lacks mobility while moving or firing and has trouble leading pushes and pursuing opponents. Be sure to include some mobile, shorter-ranged weapons in the team composition. Otherwise, a team with too many longer-ranged weapons will have major drawbacks:[9]\n\n- The lack of mobility will make it difficult for such a team to mount a push.\n\n- The reduced ability to battle in close range will make the team vulnerable to a well-timed flank or a well-positioned shark.\n\n- For these same reasons, having more than one Sting Ray in a team composition is usually redundant because Sting Ray generally requires its user to remain far from the main battle to be effective.\n\n- An opponent wielding a Dynamo Roller is a slow moving, slow swinging target that is easy prey for a any long-ranged weapon user to pick off:\nThe Custom Hydra Splatling (203.92-257.68 DU[7]), the Splatterscope (260.37 DU[7]), the E-liter 4K (290.5 DU[7]), and the E-liter 4K Scope (310.5 DU[7]) all outrange the Dynamo Roller and can splat opponents in one hit.\nWhile the Splat Charger has a similar range (240.37 DU[7]) to the maximum range of the Dynamo Roller, it has a one-shot splat and is more mobile thanks to charge storing.\nWhile the Classic Squiffer (167.65 DU[7]), the Bamboozler 14 Mk I, the Jet Squelcher (212.64 DU[7]), the Heavy Splatling, and the Ballpoint Splatling all have shorter ranges than the maximum range of the Dynamo Roller, each one can inflict damage more quickly than a Dynamo Roller can.\nWhile the Explosher has a range (200 DU) and fire rate (70 frames) comparable to those of the Dynamo Roller, the former can turf more quickly and heavily at this range, immobilizing an opposing Dynamo Roller user and leaving them vulnerable for a teammate to splat.\nA pilot of the mobile and long-ranged Inkjet can exploit the Dynamo Roller's lack of mobility but must take care not to get within the range of the opponent's vertical swing. Keep your distance – by hovering over higher ground if possible – and lead your shots. Even near misses will inflict splash damage and ink the turf surrounding the opposing Dynamo Roller user, further immobilizing them.\nAn opposing Dynamo Roller user will have a harder time than others to escape a Sting Ray, an Ink Storm or a Booyah Bomb.\n\n- The Custom Hydra Splatling (203.92-257.68 DU[7]), the Splatterscope (260.37 DU[7]), the E-liter 4K (290.5 DU[7]), and the E-liter 4K Scope (310.5 DU[7]) all outrange the Dynamo Roller and can splat opponents in one hit.\n\n- While the Splat Charger has a similar range (240.37 DU[7]) to the maximum range of the Dynamo Roller, it has a one-shot splat and is more mobile thanks to charge storing.\n\n- While the Classic Squiffer (167.65 DU[7]), the Bamboozler 14 Mk I, the Jet Squelcher (212.64 DU[7]), the Heavy Splatling, and the Ballpoint Splatling all have shorter ranges than the maximum range of the Dynamo Roller, each one can inflict damage more quickly than a Dynamo Roller can.\n\n- While the Explosher has a range (200 DU) and fire rate (70 frames) comparable to those of the Dynamo Roller, the former can turf more quickly and heavily at this range, immobilizing an opposing Dynamo Roller user and leaving them vulnerable for a teammate to splat.\n\n- A pilot of the mobile and long-ranged Inkjet can exploit the Dynamo Roller's lack of mobility but must take care not to get within the range of the opponent's vertical swing.

To exploit this weakness, rely on timely flanking or careful sharking and catch the opposing Dynamo Roller user by surprise.\nAn Inkbrush can normally get an easy splat by either rushing at or flanking a player with a Dynamo Roller, but caution is advised if you rush at a Dynamo Roller head-on, because they might swing their weapon just in time to stop an incoming Inkbrush.\n\n- An Inkbrush can normally get an easy splat by either rushing at or flanking a player with a Dynamo Roller, but caution is advised if you rush at a Dynamo Roller head-on, because they might swing their weapon just in time to stop an incoming Inkbrush.\n\n- Throwing bombs or Toxic Mist at an opposing Dynamo Roller user can force them out of position and exploit their low mobility:\nSplat Bombs can be rolled at an opposing Dynamo Roller user when they initiate a swing.

This is a useful tactic in Tower Control to maintain a Tower push.\n\nGear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.\n\nAs a heavy consumer of ink, the Dynamo Roller can be swung more often if its user can refill their ink tank at a faster rate. A valuable utility ability for almost any weapon, Ink Recovery Up is invaluable for a Dynamo Roller user.[10][11]\n\n- Six ability points, or two subs, decreases the time needed to fully refill an empty ink while submerged in friendly ink from 180 frames, or 3 seconds, to 169 frames, or 2.82 seconds[8], effectively increasing the refill rate from 33.33%/s (percent per second) to 35.46%/s.\n\nEven though a Dynamo Roller user generally keeps their distance from opponents, they can still expect to come in contact with opposing ink on various surfaces, particularly while swimming from one location to another. While in contact with the opponent's ink, Ink Resistance Up both delays the damage taken and partially offsets reduction in running speed and jumping height — including while swinging the weapon.[10][11][12]\n\n- Just three ability points, or one sub,…\n…delays the damage taken from opposing ink by 10 frames.\n…reduces the damage taken from 0.3 HP/f (health points per frame) to 0.2 HP/f.\n…lowers the limit on the amount of damage opposing ink on surfaces can inflict from 40 HP to 38 HP.\n…increases the normal running speed in opposing ink from 0.24 DU/f to 0.33 DU/f.[8]\n…increases the jumping height in opposing ink from 0.8 to 0.854.[12]\n\n- …delays the damage taken from opposing ink by 10 frames.\n\n- …reduces the damage taken from 0.3 HP/f (health points per frame) to 0.2 HP/f.\n\n- …lowers the limit on the amount of damage opposing ink on surfaces can inflict from 40 HP to 38 HP.\n\n- …increases the normal running speed in opposing ink from 0.24 DU/f to 0.33 DU/f.[8]\n\n- …increases the jumping height in opposing ink from 0.8 to 0.854.[12]\n\n- Six ability points, or two subs,…\n…delays the damage taken from opposing ink by 15 frames.\n…reduces the damage taken to 0.2 HP/f.\n…lowers the damage limit of opposing ink to 36.2 HP.\n…increases the normal running speed in opposing ink to 0.39 DU/f.[8]\n…increases the jumping height in opposing ink to 0.888.[12]\n\n- …delays the damage taken from opposing ink by 15 frames.\n\n- …reduces the damage taken to 0.2 HP/f.\n\n- …lowers the damage limit of opposing ink to 36.2 HP.\n\n- …increases the normal running speed in opposing ink to 0.39 DU/f.[8]\n\n- …increases the jumping height in opposing ink to 0.888.[12]\n\n- …delays the damage taken from opposing ink by 10 frames.\n\n- …reduces the damage taken from 0.3 HP/f (health points per frame) to 0.2 HP/f.\n\n- …lowers the limit on the amount of damage opposing ink on surfaces can inflict from 40 HP to 38 HP.\n\n- …increases the normal running speed in opposing ink from 0.24 DU/f to 0.33 DU/f.[8]\n\n- …increases the jumping height in opposing ink from 0.8 to 0.854.[12]\n\n- …delays the damage taken from opposing ink by 15 frames.\n\n- …reduces the damage taken to 0.2 HP/f.\n\n- …lowers the damage limit of opposing ink to 36.2 HP.\n\n- …increases the normal running speed in opposing ink to 0.39 DU/f.[8]\n\n- …increases the jumping height in opposing ink to 0.888.[12]\n\nReducing the Dynamo Roller's high ink consumption allows its user to swing it more often before having to refill their ink tank. Not only can this be accomplished this with Ink Saver (Main), it is also one of nineteen weapons in Splatoon 2 that receives a stronger effect from this ability. For example, just three ability points, or one sub, allows a Dynamo Roller user to swing their main weapon with full damage six times instead of the default five. However, it would be wise to invest even more ability points into Ink Saver (Main) to enable more use of the main weapon:[10]\n\n- Ten ability points, or one main, increases the number of fully damaging swings to seven.\n\n- Nineteen ability points, or a pure — one main and three subs, increases the number of swings further to eight.\n\n- 28 ability points – achievable with one main and six subs, two mains and three subs, or three mains – further increases the number of swings to nine.\n\nLast-Ditch Effort is a headgear-exclusive ability that, under specific conditions, grants its user 1 to 24 ability points each of the following abilities:\n\n- Ink Saver (Main)\n\n- Ink Saver (Sub)\n\n- Ink Recovery Up\n\nThese abilities only begin to take effect under either of the following conditions:\n\n- There are at most 30 seconds remaining on the game clock, or Overtime has begun in a Ranked Battle, at which the maximum 24 ability points will be granted for each of the above abilities.\n\n- In a Ranked Battle, the opposing team's countdown has at most 50 points remaining. The effects of Last-Ditch Effort increase as the opposing team's countdown decreases from 50 to 30 points remaining, starting with 1 ability point for each ability and maxing out to 24 ability points.\n\nA Dynamo Roller user can potentially benefit greatly from Last-Ditch Effort, particularly from Ink Saver (Main) and Ink Recovery Up, allowing them to more freely use the main weapon during the final moments of a battle or whenever the opposing team has decreased their count a substantial amount.[10] However, a Dynamo Roller user equipped with at least two mains of Ink Saver (Main) will have to decide whether it is worthwhile to sacrifice one full swing of their main weapon from the start of the battle for the possible trade-off of receiving two extra swings – one more than with another Ink Saver (Main) – late in the battle.\n\nMain Power Up increases damage to rollers by up to 15%, slightly increasing the lethal and two-hit ranges of the Dynamo Roller, making it more consistent at inflicting damage.[10]\n\nQuick Super Jump decreases both the \"charge\" time before and the travel time of a Super Jump, allowing its user to escape more quickly. A Dynamo Roller user struggles to escape from rushing opponents and would also have an incentive to maintain valuable special gauge progress for their Sting Ray.[10][11]\n\n- Six ability points, or two subs, of Quick Super Jump decreases the \"charge\" time by 30 frames, or 0.5 seconds.[8]\n\nSpecial Charge Up accelerates building up the special gauge for Sting Ray. Since farming Sting Ray is one of a few roles of the Dynamo Roller, constantly having Sting Ray available ensures more successful pushes and counter-pushes.[10]\n\n- Ten ability points – one main – are enough to reduce the special gauge requirement to 166p.[8]\n\nDue to being a heavyweight weapon, the Dynamo Roller inherently slows the swim speed of its user. Swim Speed Up enables them to more quickly return to the site of engagement, more quickly respond to an opponents' push, and better keep their distance from aggressive opponents.[10]\n\n- Just three ability points, or one sub, will increase the Dynamo's swim speed to 1.88 units per frame - which is roughly the same as a middleweight weapon without any Swim Speed Up, at 1.92 units per frame.\n\n- Nine ability points, or three subs, will allow the user to swim just slightly faster than a lightweight weapon without any Swim Speed Up at 2.02 units per frame.[8]\n\n[13]"
