    "The Suction Bomb is one of four lethal bombs available in Splatoon 2, having the largest blast radius and, from version 4.7.0 onwards, the highest damage available. Its versatility makes its both similar to and reliable as Splat Bombs, although its differences allow it to be used in a few unique ways.",
    "Suction Bombs have a few key differences from Splat Bombs that affect how they can be used:",
    "- They can attach to surfaces, which offers two advantages over Splat Bombs:\nIt allows more room for error when aiming, such as when throwing onto the Tower, whereas a Splat Bomb user has to account for any rolling or bounces.\nThe ability to adhere to surfaces either sideways or upside down allows the planting of craftier traps, such as underneath a grate.",
    "- They take two seconds after attaching to a surface to detonate, as opposed to one second for a Splat Bomb, so plant Suction Bombs earlier than usual, particularly when wielding a longer-ranged weapon – such as an H-3 Nozzlenose D or a Fresh Squiffer – and being rushed down by an opponent.",
    "- They inflict more damage from a direct hit and have a larger overall radius of damage.\nTargets within 50 DU – one distance line away in the test range – will receive 220 damage — more than enough to splat most opponents.\nTargets between 50 DU and 80 DU – a little over 1.5 distance lines away – will receive 30 damage, which is sometimes enough to splat weakened opponents.",
    "Otherwise, Suction Bombs can be used in a similar fashion as can Splat Bombs:",
    "- Throw a Suction Bomb forward to lead pushes into a Splat Zone or any other important area of the stage, such as the opponents' street or platform.",
    "- They can also flush out opposing anchors from perches and clear other critical areas, such as the Tower.\nUnless a Suction Bomb is perfectly upright on the stake atop the Tower, an opponent riding the Tower can use this stake to take cover from the blast radius. Therefore, to stall or slow down the Tower's progress, throw a Suction Bomb onto one side of the Tower and fire upon the other side.[2]",
    "- They can also be used to poke at and zone out opponents during the neutral phase, stall an opponent's push, or provide space to escape.",
    "- A Suction Bomb can damage or destroy an opponent's brella shield, Splash Wall, or Baller or the Rainmaker shield, while detonating on contact.\nAny opponents caught within the Suction Bomb's explosion will get damaged or splatted.[3]\nIt will also inflate or pop a teammate's bubbles but deflate or diffuse an opponent's bubbles, while still detonating on contact.[4]",
    "- An opponent's Splashdown or Booyah Bomb will defuse any Suction Bombs it touches, so hold off throwing them until after the special weapon finishes.",
    "Lethal bombs – particularly either Splat or Suction Bombs – provide its user's team many advantages over another team that has no lethal bombs in its composition:[5]",
    "- Their one-hit-splat offers its user's team chances of instantly gaining a numbers advantage, from which a game-winning push can arise.",
    "- Their lethal explosion provides space for its user's team to either push into an area held by the opponent or stall an opponent's push.",
    "- The turf inked by the resulting explosion contributes to both maintaining map control and building up the special gauge.",
    "A player with Suction Bombs in their weapon's kit – especially one whose main weapon lacks either range or damage – can provide valuable support for any teammate:",
    "- If using a short-ranged main weapon, cooperate with the teammate using primarily Suction Bombs when engaging an opponent: attack from different angles, or force the opponent to come within range of the teammate's weapon.",
    "- If your teammate gets splatted and an opponent is still present, then determine whether you can easily finish them off. If your weapon is either too weak or too short-ranged or if the opponent either is too healthy or has a teammate, then strongly consider retreating instead of risking getting splatted.",
    "- When attacking the Tower with a teammate, attack from a different angle from your teammate and throw a Suction Bomb onto the side of the Tower opposite from your teammate, who can directly assault the other side to dislodge the opposing Tower rider.[6]",
    "- While the lethal damage of the Suction Bomb can only be avoided by dodging, its splash damage of 30 HP can be reduced by equipping Bomb Defense Up DX. Just three ability points, or one sub, offer good utility against Suction Bombs:[7][8][9]\nA player who has taken at least 30 HP of damage from the opponent (thus, has no more than 70 HP) will be visible on the opponents' map. Bomb Defense Up DX prevents its user from being exposed by the splash damage of a single Suction Bomb.\nInk Armor will not break due to splash damage from a single bomb whose splash damage normally inflicts 30 HP of damage.[7] With Ink Armor still intact, its wearer will only suffer a maximum of 80 HP of damage from a single hit, allowing them to withstand a single powerful attack, such as that from a Splat Charger.",
    "- Because a Suction Bomb takes two seconds to detonate, one can ignore it for about a second before moving. However, take into account its larger blast radius.",
    "- If an opponent throws a Suction Bomb onto the Tower while you are riding it, you can move to the other side of the Tower and use the stake for cover from the blast. However, be ready to fend off any opponents – including the one who threw the Suction Bomb – who attempt to attack this other side.[10]",
    "- Be aware of your opponents' locations before using a brella shield, Splash Wall, Baller, or Bubble Blower, as an opponent's Suction Bombs will detonate upon impact with any of these, potentially splatting you or your teammates if caught within their lethal radius.",
    "- Certain special weapons, such as Splashdown and Booyah Bomb, can negate any of the opponents' Suction Bombs."
