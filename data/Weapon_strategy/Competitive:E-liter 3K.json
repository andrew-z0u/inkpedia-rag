    "The E-liter has a slow charge paired with a long range and deadly percussion. A popular strategy for charger users is to perch at high points, and pick off opponents while their teammates ink the stage. E-liter 3K users can utilize Burst Bombs to force opponents out of ink and track them with Echolocator."
