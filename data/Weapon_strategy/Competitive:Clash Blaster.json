    "The Clash Blaster is an aggressive weapon capable of quickly splatting opposing forces and assisting with weakened enemies. Its ability to stay mobile helps the user to dodge oncoming strikes while sneaking in attacks of its own.",
    "The Clash Blaster is a fast slayer weapon. Its large blast radius can help it with chip damage in battle. Its kit, Splat Bomb and Trizooka, is good for both offense and defense.",
    "TBA",
    "The Clash Blaster is usually in the middle of fights, whether Sharking or finishing off damaged opponents:",
    "- As with most blasters, getting too close to an opponent results in an awkward position where the user cannot easily find their target. Still, a close range is ideal for the Clash Blaster, as it has a range of 95 DU, compared to the Splattershot, with 116.99 DU.\nIts sub, Splat Bomb, has reasonable range, which can be used to pick off enemies from a safer distance. They can also be used right before engaging in a fight to possibly deal an extra 30 damage to finish off the opponent faster. Its Trizooka complements the main, with range that allows it to attack enemy anchors, such as E-liter 4K and Hydra Splatling.\nAs a Trick Skirmisher, it is critical to always take note of the terrain. Being directly beneath low ledges often gives a great advantage for this blaster, allowing the user to hit opponents above them while staying generally protected. Being on the same level as the enemy can offer risk, as a splat can take up to four hits (each indirect hit does about 30 damage, direct hits do 60), giving the opponent a chance. When above, it is best to wait for enemies to be close by beneath for easy reach, while sending splat bombs at further opponents.",
    "- While jump RNG still exists on the Clash Blaster, it is not as much of a problem as its blast radius is the largest in the game. This, combined with its fire rate of one shot every 20 frames, (three per second), makes the need for direct hits less necessary, though still helpful. The weapon often relies on its mobility and large blasts to fulfill its slayer role.",
    "- In Turf War, the Clash Blaster's role does not change. The user's goal is to keep the opponents out of the way, relying on their team for turf. Thus, this weapon should always be in the front, mainly fighting the battles.",
    "- In Anarchy or X Battles, it should always keep track of the objective, as all weapons generally should. However, aggression is still important, and getting splats is usually the goal.\nIn Rainmaker, it is best to stay far in front of the Rainmaker when on the user's side, or to hang back in choke points when the Rainmaker is in the possession of the opposing team. This gives an opportunity to quickly stop the advancing team, especially once at a closer range.\nIn Splat Zones, staying around the edges of the Zone gives an advantage to the blaster, being able to swiftly move in and stop any enemies attempting to claim the Zone from ground level or above.\nTower Control is possibly the best mode for Clash Blaster, as the objective is a small area in which the blast radius can completely cover. So, a few blasts can easily stop the tower in its tracks, and allow the player's team to take it back.\nClam Blitz is a tricky mode to play with this weapon, as the player must decide between aggression or defense. Therefore, they must keep track of all enemy players and slip between sides depending on the immediate need.",
    "- Because the Clash Blaster can jump into a battle so quickly, it excels at immediately assisting a teammate in a fight or finishing off fleeing opponents. Be sure to keep track of enemy players whenever possible, and be able to fire into the midst of the fight by already being there.",
    "- Like all blasters, Clash Blaster has a hard time dealing with weapons to close or to far away, so moving closer may be better than trying to run from its large blast radius and possible Trizooka.",
    "- Despite the Trizooka, hiding behind cover is not as useful as other weapons, as Clash Blaster, like other blasters, can hit around corners.",
    "- Rushing down or sharking the weapon can be especially useful with its slow kill time even with two direct hits.",
    "Gear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.",
    "These two movement abilities allow you to keep opponents in your effective range when they try to run or get closer.",
    "Normal utility subs for most weapons, only one sub is recommended.",
    "Clash Blaster may be better at turfing than other blasters, but still not as good as other weapons. This ability can shorten the long time it can take to get your Trizooka.",
    "Because Clash Blaster is a slayer and can't turf that well, one or two subs of Special Saver can be useful for getting your Trizooka more often.",
    "Special Power Up increases the duration and explosion radius of your Trizooka, making it overall a good ability to have one or two subs of.",
    "Throwing a Splat Bomb only leaves you only 7 Clash Blaster shots, so Ink Saver (Sub) can prove very useful if you need to fight after throwing a Splat Bomb.",
    "Despite Clash Blaster's good ink efficiency per shot, its fast fire rate can deplete your ink tank faster than expected.",
    "Either ability will work. Stealth Jump will get you safer Super Jumps, and Drop Roller will give you movement buffs, which are useful for Clash Blaster.",
    "Clash Blaster is a slayer will get splatted more than some other weapons, causing Comeback to activate a lot. However Last-Ditch Effort is a good ability for its ink-saving capabilities, especially in Anarchy Battle where it can activate for longer periods of time."
