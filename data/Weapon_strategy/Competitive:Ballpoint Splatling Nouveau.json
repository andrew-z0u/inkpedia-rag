  "content": "Unique to the weapon and its vanilla variant, The Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau has two different stages of firing, each functioning differently. In addition, it can also recharge while firing. Unlike the vanilla variant, the Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau's kit works with the weapon's anchor role.\n\nThe Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau's long range best suit the weapon for an anchor role.\n\n- Like other splatlings, the Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau needs to charge before firing.\nThe charge time, while shorter than the Hydra Splatling, is longer than the rest of the splatlings, taking 50 frames to charge the first ring, and 100 frames to charge the maximum amount.\nUnlike other splatlings, the Ballpoint's range does not decreases if it does not have a full charge, it only decreases the time shots are fired.\nThe Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau, with its mobility and fire rate of the first charge, does not need to be hidden behind a wall while charging as it can deal with opponents charging in.\nWhile firing, the weapon can recharge itself, which can be useful for keeping the Ballpoint in one mode.\n\n- The charge time, while shorter than the Hydra Splatling, is longer than the rest of the splatlings, taking 50 frames to charge the first ring, and 100 frames to charge the maximum amount.\n\n- Unlike other splatlings, the Ballpoint's range does not decreases if it does not have a full charge, it only decreases the time shots are fired.\n\n- The Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau, with its mobility and fire rate of the first charge, does not need to be hidden behind a wall while charging as it can deal with opponents charging in.\n\n- While firing, the weapon can recharge itself, which can be useful for keeping the Ballpoint in one mode.\n\n- The charge time, while shorter than the Hydra Splatling, is longer than the rest of the splatlings, taking 50 frames to charge the first ring, and 100 frames to charge the maximum amount.\n\n- Unlike other splatlings, the Ballpoint's range does not decreases if it does not have a full charge, it only decreases the time shots are fired.\n\n- The Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau, with its mobility and fire rate of the first charge, does not need to be hidden behind a wall while charging as it can deal with opponents charging in.\n\n- While firing, the weapon can recharge itself, which can be useful for keeping the Ballpoint in one mode.\n\nThe unique trait of the Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau that separates it from other splatlings is its two modes\n\n- The first ring of charge gives the user a mode where shots spread, lower damage, shorter range, but faster fire rate and higher mobility.\nThis mode is generally better at dealing with close range opponents, as it outranges shorter ranged weapons such as the Sploosh-o-matic 7 or Neo Splash-o-matic\nThis mode also is better at turfing with the shot spread covering more turf than its second mode.\n\n- This mode is generally better at dealing with close range opponents, as it outranges shorter ranged weapons such as the Sploosh-o-matic 7 or Neo Splash-o-matic\n\n- This mode also is better at turfing with the shot spread covering more turf than its second mode.\n\n- The second ring of charge gives the user perfect accuracy, higher damage, and range close enough to the Hydra Splatling, at the cost of lower mobility and slower shot velocity.\nThis mode can oppose other splatlings and even longer ranged shooters such as the Jet Squelcher with its range without sacrificing too much mobility.\nWhile it can still oppose a Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau, an unaware Custom Hydra Splatling or chargers can still be picked off by the user.\nTo keep the long ranged mode consistent, once the long ranged mode ends, charge again a slight amount then fire again. If performed correctly, the long range should still be active and it will even give the user slightly more mobility while charging.\n\n- This mode can oppose other splatlings and even longer ranged shooters such as the Jet Squelcher with its range without sacrificing too much mobility.\n\n- While it can still oppose a Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau, an unaware Custom Hydra Splatling or chargers can still be picked off by the user.\n\n- To keep the long ranged mode consistent, once the long ranged mode ends, charge again a slight amount then fire again. If performed correctly, the long range should still be active and it will even give the user slightly more mobility while charging.\n\n- This mode is generally better at dealing with close range opponents, as it outranges shorter ranged weapons such as the Sploosh-o-matic 7 or Neo Splash-o-matic\n\n- This mode also is better at turfing with the shot spread covering more turf than its second mode.\n\n- This mode can oppose other splatlings and even longer ranged shooters such as the Jet Squelcher with its range without sacrificing too much mobility.\n\n- While it can still oppose a Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau, an unaware Custom Hydra Splatling or chargers can still be picked off by the user.\n\n- To keep the long ranged mode consistent, once the long ranged mode ends, charge again a slight amount then fire again. If performed correctly, the long range should still be active and it will even give the user slightly more mobility while charging.\n\nThe Squid Beakon, while not useful for attacking, can provide other uses:\n\n- The main purpose of the Squid Beakon is to provide a place for teammates and the player to Super Jump to. Place Squid Beakons in hidden places as the enemy team can destroy the Beakon by shooting at it.\nSquid Beakons can allow for a wiped team to get back into the front lines.\nThey also can give a teammate a better spot to jump to if the rest of the opponents are in danger.\n\n- Squid Beakons can allow for a wiped team to get back into the front lines.\n\n- They also can give a teammate a better spot to jump to if the rest of the opponents are in danger.\n\n- The Squid Beakon can also be used as a temporary shield. If under fire, place a Squid Beakon and the shots will be blocked until the Beakon breaks\n\n- The Squid Beakon can be used as bait. Hide in ink near the Beakon, and when an opponent comes close to it, quickly splat them.\nNote that this may not work if the opponent has a long range weapon.\nBe careful not to waste too much time around the Beakon.\n\n- Note that this may not work if the opponent has a long range weapon.\n\n- Be careful not to waste too much time around the Beakon.\n\n- Unlike shorter ranged weapons with Squid Beakon, longer ranged weapons, such as the Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau benefit most from Squid Beakon as they do not need bombs to poke at longer range.[1]\n\n- Squid Beakons can allow for a wiped team to get back into the front lines.\n\n- They also can give a teammate a better spot to jump to if the rest of the opponents are in danger.\n\n- Note that this may not work if the opponent has a long range weapon.\n\n- Be careful not to waste too much time around the Beakon.\n\nInk Storm is an area of effect (AoE) special weapon that can alter the battle if activated in the right location and direction:\n\n- Immediately upon activating the special, its user will be holding the Ink Storm device and be vulnerable to attack. Therefore, do not activate the special while being attacked, and make sure to throw it onto a surface before an opponent gets the opportunity to splat you.\n\n- Slower, less mobile opponents – especially Rainmaker carriers – are less capable of escaping Ink Storm's area of effect and, thus, are more adversely affected.\n\n- Its gradual damage makes it a good counter against Ink Armor, especially when paired with Object Shredder.\n\n- Ink Storm's damage on the opponent becomes more effective whenever the opponent has less space to maneuver around, such as in an alley or on the Tower.\n\n- Defensively, Ink Storm can slow or disrupt the opponents' push by either altering their intended attack routes or weakening any opponents within the storm.\n\n- Offensively, Ink Storm can soften opposing defenses by forcing opponents out of optimal positions and inflicting chip damage onto those caught in the ink rain.\n\n- Besides potentially damaging opponents, Ink Storm also gradually turfs any non-vertical surface it travels over:\nThe damaging and turfing effects of Ink Storm are slower and more gradual than those of a Bomb Launcher but are automatic and does not require its user to risk endangering themselves.\n\n- The damaging and turfing effects of Ink Storm are slower and more gradual than those of a Bomb Launcher but are automatic and does not require its user to risk endangering themselves.\n\n- An Ink Storm above the Rainmaker can either weaken its shield to pop it or prevent the opponent from popping it.\n\n- Special weapons are also free ink tank refills, allowing a Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau user to launch Ink Storm and immediately attack opponents fleeing it.\n\n- The damaging and turfing effects of Ink Storm are slower and more gradual than those of a Bomb Launcher but are automatic and does not require its user to risk endangering themselves.\n\nThe Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau is a \"jack-of-all-trades\" weapon with a decent close-up turfing mode and longer ranged mode. Combined with the mobility, the weapon does not have many of the disadvantages most splatlings need a team for.\n\nThe Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau's lack of lethal bombs can also be a liability to a team composition. Lethal bombs – particularly either Splat or Suction Bombs – provide their user's team a couple advantages over another team that has no lethal bombs in its composition:[2]\n\n- Their one-hit-splat offers its user's team chances of instantly gaining a numbers advantage, from which a game-winning push can arise.\n\n- Their lethal explosion provides space for its user's team to either push into an area held by the opponent or stall an opponent's push.\n\nInk Storm is intended for either contesting territory, such as Splat Zones, or stalling opponents' pushes but is not as reliable at splatting opponents who actively avoid the Storm. Therefore, it is advised to have other special weapons available to complement Ink Storm, as having too many users of any combination of Ink Storm and Bomb Launcher (no more than two) in a team composition will limit a team's arsenal of weapons:\n\n- Ink Storm provides no direct means of protection, meaning that opponents can still fire or throw sub weapons into the Storm.\n\n- Other special weapons, such as Inkjet or Sting Ray, are intended for splatting opponents and more capable at this than is Ink Storm.\n\nCombining Ink Storm with other specials can bolster a team's ability to either make a push or counter the opponents' push:\n\n- Ink Armor and other protective special weapons, such as Baller and Bubble Blower, can increase the survivability of a team as they push into contested territory.\n\n- After launching Ink Storm, a teammate who is using a special weapon designed for splat opponents, such as Sting Ray or Inkjet, can further limit the opponents' escape options or splat them as they scatter.\n\n- If using a short-ranged weapon, try to either get behind them without getting noticed or shark until they come close enough for you to exploit their low mobility and long charge time.\nTenta Missiles and Booyah Bomb are both great ways to disrupt a Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau if they are charging.\n\n- Tenta Missiles and Booyah Bomb are both great ways to disrupt a Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau if they are charging.\n\n- Users of other anchor's weapons have different advantages and disadvantages against an opposing Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau user:\nCertain chargers – all variants of the Splatterscope, the E-liter 4K, and the E-liter 4K Scope – can hard-counter an opposing Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau user due to their superior range and one-shot-splat potential and the latter's lack of mobility while on the second mode.\nVariants of the Splat Charger have the ability to store a charge and one-shot-splat capability give them the advantage.\n\n- Certain chargers – all variants of the Splatterscope, the E-liter 4K, and the E-liter 4K Scope – can hard-counter an opposing Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau user due to their superior range and one-shot-splat potential and the latter's lack of mobility while on the second mode.\n\n- Variants of the Splat Charger have the ability to store a charge and one-shot-splat capability give them the advantage.\n\n- The Custom Jet Squelcher, the Bamboozler 14 Mk I, the Heavy Splatling Remix, and both the Fresh Squiffer and the Nautilus 79 can more easily farm their respective special weapons – Sting Ray at 190p, Tenta Missiles at 200p, Booyah Bomb at 190p, and Inkjet at 180p – and use them to dislodge the Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau.\n\n- When facing an opposing Ink Storm, assess where is a safe place to either reroute an attack or reposition on defense:\nIn general, avoid getting caught under an opponent's Ink Storm for an extended time, but also be wary of opponents waiting to pick off anyone fleeing the Storm.\n\n- In general, avoid getting caught under an opponent's Ink Storm for an extended time, but also be wary of opponents waiting to pick off anyone fleeing the Storm.\n\n- When facing a team who possesses both Ink Storm and main weapons whose damage is increased with Main Power Up, pay extra attention to where the Main Power Up-boosted opponents are at whenever they launch their Ink Storm.\nIf you must travel under an opponent's Ink Storm, avoid moving in the same direction that the Storm is traveling to minimize damage.\nEven while avoiding an opponent's Ink Storm, it is still possible to turf or otherwise influence the area underneath. Long-ranged weapons, thrown sub weapons, and other special weapons (such as a counter-Ink Storm or Bomb Launcher) can splat opponents or dissuade them from occupying the turf underneath.\n\n- If you must travel under an opponent's Ink Storm, avoid moving in the same direction that the Storm is traveling to minimize damage.\n\n- Even while avoiding an opponent's Ink Storm, it is still possible to turf or otherwise influence the area underneath.

This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.\n\nEver since its introduction in version 4.3.0, Bomb Defense Up DX will not only reduce the damage taken from opposing sub and special weapons that are not one-hit-splat but will also reduce the duration of the tracking effects of certain opponent's sub and special weapons, such as Point Sensors and Ink Mines, allowing the user of this ability to evade detection more easily. Since the Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau is prone to being attacked by bombs and Tenta Missiles due to it being an anchor, having this ability is great for improving its survivability - especially considering how slow it is in its second mode. Just three ability points, or one sub, offer plenty of utility:[3][4]\n\n- The splash damage of most bombs is reduced from 30 HP to 28.6 HP. This reduction in damage provides two benefits:\nIt prevents its user from being exposed on their opponents' map by the splash damage of most single bombs.\nInk Armor will not break due to splash damage from a single bomb whose splash damage normally inflicts 30 HP of damage.\n\n- It prevents its user from being exposed on their opponents' map by the splash damage of most single bombs.\n\n- Ink Armor will not break due to splash damage from a single bomb whose splash damage normally inflicts 30 HP of damage.\n\n- The splash damage of near-misses from either Tenta Missiles or Inkjet, the minimum splash damage of bubbles, and the collision damage from Baller are all reduced from 50 HP to 48.3 HP[5] enabling one to survive two hits from any of these specific means of special weapon damage.\n\n- It prevents its user from being exposed on their opponents' map by the splash damage of most single bombs.\n\n- Ink Armor will not break due to splash damage from a single bomb whose splash damage normally inflicts 30 HP of damage.\n\nA Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau user can expect to come in contact with the opponent's ink on various surfaces, which can both be damaging and reduce mobility - especially since this weapon has poor turfing ability. Ink Resistance Up not only partially offsets the reduction in mobility but also delays the damage taken from contact with opposing ink.\n\n- Just three ability points, or one sub,…\n…delays the damage taken from opposing ink by 10 frames.\n…reduces the damage taken from 0.3 HP/f (health points per frame) to 0.2 HP/f.\n…lowers the limit on the amount of damage opposing ink on surfaces can inflict from 40 HP to 38 HP.\n…increases the normal running speed in opposing ink from 0.24 DU/f to 0.33 DU/f.[6]\n…increases the jumping height in opposing ink from 0.8 to 0.854.\n\n- …delays the damage taken from opposing ink by 10 frames.\n\n- …reduces the damage taken from 0.3 HP/f (health points per frame) to 0.2 HP/f.\n\n- …lowers the limit on the amount of damage opposing ink on surfaces can inflict from 40 HP to 38 HP.\n\n- …increases the normal running speed in opposing ink from 0.24 DU/f to 0.33 DU/f.[6]\n\n- …increases the jumping height in opposing ink from 0.8 to 0.854.\n\n- Six ability points, or two subs,…\n…delays the damage taken from opposing ink by 15 frames.\n…reduces the damage taken to 0.2 HP/f.\n…lowers the damage limit of opposing ink to 36.2 HP.\n…increases the normal running speed in opposing ink to 0.39 DU/f.\n…increases the jumping height in opposing ink to 0.888.\n\n- …delays the damage taken from opposing ink by 15 frames.\n\n- …reduces the damage taken to 0.2 HP/f.\n\n- …lowers the damage limit of opposing ink to 36.2 HP.\n\n- …increases the normal running speed in opposing ink to 0.39 DU/f.\n\n- …increases the jumping height in opposing ink to 0.888.\n\n- …delays the damage taken from opposing ink by 10 frames.\n\n- …reduces the damage taken from 0.3 HP/f (health points per frame) to 0.2 HP/f.\n\n- …lowers the limit on the amount of damage opposing ink on surfaces can inflict from 40 HP to 38 HP.\n\n- …increases the normal running speed in opposing ink from 0.24 DU/f to 0.33 DU/f.[6]\n\n- …increases the jumping height in opposing ink from 0.8 to 0.854.\n\n- …delays the damage taken from opposing ink by 15 frames.\n\n- …reduces the damage taken to 0.2 HP/f.\n\n- …lowers the damage limit of opposing ink to 36.2 HP.\n\n- …increases the normal running speed in opposing ink to 0.39 DU/f.\n\n- …increases the jumping height in opposing ink to 0.888.\n\nAn ability exclusive to shoes, Object Shredder provides a Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau user three specific benefits:\n\n- It increases their damage dealt to bubbles – both friendly and opposing – by 30%, allowing for quicker growing and popping of bubbles.\n\n- It triples the amount of damage inflicted onto armored opponents, allowing a Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau to break an opponent's Ink Armor in one hit. Falloff damage can often occur due to the weapon's long range, which can prevent Ink Armor from being broken easily as long range mode does 30 damage. Short range mode also benefits from this as it doesn't do enough damage by default. Finally, its Ink Storm will also be potent against Ink Armor.\n\n- It enables them to pop the Rainmaker shield more quickly with either their main weapon or Suction Bombs, allowing their team to start or restart a push more quickly while gaining a large amount of turf control in the immediate area.\n\nThe Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau benefits most from the second buff, allowing it to consistently break Ink Armor in one hit.[7]\n\nQuick Super Jump decreases both the \"charge\" time before and the travel time of a Super Jump, allowing its user to escape more quickly. A Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau user is usually vulnerable in close quarters and would also have an incentive to maintain valuable special gauge progress for their Ink Storm.\n\n- Six ability points, or two subs, of Quick Super Jump decreases the \"charge\" time by 30 frames, or 0.5 seconds.\n\nBecause a Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau user spends comparatively more time in humanoid form charging and firing their weapon, they can be easier targets for opponents to splat. Run Speed Up increases the running speed of a Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau user, including while charging and firing.\n\nSub Power Up decreases the time it takes to Super Jump to a Squid Beakon. Sub Power Up can help a Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau user benefit from Squid Beakons more and allow their team to get back to the battlefield quickly to push.\n[8]"
