  "content": "The Painbrush BRN-Z is a weapon that was introduced in the Splatlands Collection update of Splatoon 3. It is a Painbrush with a different kit. Like the original version, this weapon has the ability to fling ink and slide across a stage and can pose a threat at a distance unlike other brushes. This weapon can be considered as a Slayer due to its ability to lead an offensive, thanks to the main weapon at close range, and the Trizooka at longer distance.\n\n- 1 Splatoon 3\n\n1.1 Use\n1.2 Synergy\n1.3 Countermeasures\n1.4 Gear abilities[1]\n\n- 1.1 Use\n\n- 1.2 Synergy\n\n- 1.3 Countermeasures\n\n- 1.4 Gear abilities[1]\n\n- 2 References\n\n- 1.1 Use\n\n- 1.2 Synergy\n\n- 1.3 Countermeasures\n\n- 1.4 Gear abilities[1]\n\nTDA\n\nTDA\n\nTDA\n\nHelps combat the main weapon's low ink efficiency.\n\nHelps combat the sub weapon's low ink efficiency.\n\nIncreases mobility.
