    "The Painbrush BRN-Z is a weapon that was introduced in the Splatlands Collection update of Splatoon 3. It is a Painbrush with a different kit. Like the original version, this weapon has the ability to fling ink and slide across a stage and can pose a threat at a distance unlike other brushes. This weapon can be considered as a Slayer due to its ability to lead an offensive, thanks to the main weapon at close range, and the Trizooka at longer distance.",
    "TDA",
    "Helps combat the main weapon's low ink efficiency.",
    "Helps combat the sub weapon's low ink efficiency.",
    "Increases mobility. Also allows you to move into other parts of the map quickly to help with things like objective and enemy control.",
    "Allows for being more aggressive without risk of wasting time in case of an attack failure.",
    "Makes it easier to sneak up on enemies, and also allows you to move into sharking positions without being noticed.",
    "Stealth Jump helps with stealth, will help prevent immediate attacks upon landing from a Super Jump, as the Painbrush has a long windup time before it can swing and cannot defend itself easily."
