Its kit includes Splat Bomb and Bomb Rush.\n\nThe weapon can be used aggressively against other weapons at close range. It is possible to take the enemy by surprise using a Splat Bomb, or spam them with the included Bomb Rush. The weapon does not, however, have a real long-range attack method.\n\nLike the original Luna Blaster, the Luna Blaster Neo is effective in close combat, thanks to its large explosions and higher rate of fire than a standard Blaster. Its short range forces it however to get close to the opponent.\nThe Splat Bomb can be used to combo or finish off an opponent slightly too far away to be hit by the primary weapon. Since Bomb Rush costs a small amount of turfed ground to use (180p), this special weapon can be used to harass opponents with many Splat Bombs.\n\nUnlike the original Luna Blaster, the Luna Blaster Neo does not have an Inkzooka or other ranged attack option. Its short range can be exploited with a weapon with more range. Using a Splat Bomb is expensive for the Luna Blaster Neo in ink, so be sure to attack it then.\n\nTBA.\n\nThe Luna Blaster Neo returns in Splatoon 2 on February 24, 2018. Its kit contains Ink Mine and Suction-Bomb Launcher.\nThe main weapon has undergone changes since the previous game.\n\nSee the Luna Blaster page for details of the changes: Competitive: Luna Blaster\n\nThe Luna Blaster Neo is a rarely seen weapon. Its kit offers almost no ranged attack possibilities. It can be used in Rainmaker thanks to its kit.\n\nThe Ink Mine does not help the main weapon to carry out attacks or compensate for its short range. However, it can be used in strategic locations such as the \npedestal in Rainmaker or around the basket in Clam Blitz. But otherwise, its use is very limited. The Suction-Bomb Launcher can be used to harass the opponent with bombs or force them to move out of a particular area. However, its use is inconsistent, as it is not always available when needed, and Suction Bombs are slower and more predictable than Splat Bombs. Furthermore, compared to the Bomb Rush of the Splatoon's Luna Blaster Neo, the Bomb Launcher in Splatoon 2 launches bombs less far, except when holding down the R button, which makes successive bomb launches much slower.\n\nThis weapon can be countered by any weapon with more range. You just have to avoid getting too close and be wary of at least the Ink Mines placed on the ground in case the enemy Luna Blaster Neo escapes.\n\nTBA."
