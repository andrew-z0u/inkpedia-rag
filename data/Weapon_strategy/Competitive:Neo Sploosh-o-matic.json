    "The Neo Sploosh-o-matic functions differently than in the second game.",
    "While unable to inflict any damage onto opponents, the Point Sensor can aid its user and their teammates if used wisely:",
    "Kraken is a powerful special weapon that can easily turn the tide of battle:",
    "Point Sensors lack certain advantages offered by lethal bombs — particularly either Splat or Suction Bombs, which provide their user's team a couple advantages over another team that has no lethal bombs in its composition:",
    "While a powerful special that can favor its user, Kraken may not benefit a team as much if multiple teammates have Kraken for a few reasons:",
    "Gear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.",
    "Cold Blooded is an ability that shortens the duration of position-tracking to 50% of normal tracking time. As a stealthy, mobile weapon, Cold Blooded is immensely useful for the Neo Sploosh-o-matic, enhancing its sneakiness, facilitating ambushes, preventing enemy ambushes, enabling more mobility, and preventing chargers from quickly splatting players.",
    "Swim Speed Up increases movement speed while in squid form, allowing the user to charge into situations and to escape. This also affects the movement speed of the Kraken, which can improve its performance.",
    "Quick Respawn always shortens the time taken to respawn, allow a Neo Sploosh-o-matic user to be aggressive without much consequences.",
    "The Neo Sploosh-o-matic is a weapon with a very different playstyle than its other variants. Instead of being an aggressive slayer, its kit forces it into a very passive support role, spamming Tenta Missiles and typically avoiding direct confrontation with the other team.[4]",
    "While the Neo Sploosh-o-matic is a slayer's weapon, its lack of range and accuracy forces it to be played differently from how typical slayer's weapons are played:",
    "The Squid Beakon, while not useful for attacking, the Squid Beakon has many uses:",
    "Tenta Missiles can be used to locate and pressure opponents and force them out of position without having to commit too far forward:",
    "While one user of a short-ranged weapon such as the Neo Sploosh-o-matic might get away with a lack of range, having too many short-ranged weapons on a team without a longer-ranged weapon to provide support fire is often disadvantageous for a number of reasons:[9]",
    "The Neo Sploosh-o-matic's rapid turfing and Tenta Missile means that a fellow slayer does not necessarily need to turf or build up their specials as often, freeing them to use other complementary weapons:",
    "While having multiple players on the same team launching Tenta Missiles might seem like a fun and easy means to cause opponents to scramble for cover, having too many players equipped with them – no more than one or two – can reduce the effectiveness of a team composition:",
    "The very short range of the Neo Sploosh-o-matic makes it easy for opponents to zone it out with most other main weapons and bombs.",
    "A competent Neo Sploosh-o-matic user is more likely to attack via flanking or sharking:",
    "Coordinating with your teammates can greatly increase the Tenta Missiles' effect during a battle:",
    "Gear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.",
    "Ninja Squid reduces detection by opponents while swimming on non-vertical surfaces. It allows its user to swim at full speed undetected at the cost of about 20% of the maximum swimming speed as of version 3.0.0. Because a Neo Sploosh-o-matic user has difficulty attacking most opponents head-on, Ninja Squid can make it easier for its user to shark and more safely approach opponents.",
    "Special Charge Up accelerates building up the special gauge for Tenta Missiles. As one of it's main advantages being able to spam Tenta Missiles, constantly having Tenta Missiles available can help for pushes and pressuring opponents.",
    "Sub Power Up decreases the time it takes to Super Jump to a Squid Beakon. Sub Power Up can help a Neo Sploosh-o-matic user benefit from Squid Beakons more and allow their team to get back to the battlefield quickly to push.",
    "As a short-ranged weapon that excels at flanking, the Neo Sploosh-o-matic greatly benefits if it is able to swim faster. Swim Speed Up enables its user to more quickly close the distance towards an opponent, more quickly respond to an opponents' push, or even escape unfavorable situations.",
    "[11][12]",
    "- The weapon is middleweight instead of lightweight.",
    "- Ink consumption is slightly lower, consuming 0.7% of the ink tank than 0.8%",
    "- The chance to shoot towards the outer reticle is 10% than 2% in the Splatoon 2, meaning the weapon is slightly less accurate.",
    "- In Splatoon 2 the time it takes to reach maximum swim speed is lower than in Splatoon, making the weapon less mobile than in Splatoon 2",
    "- It temporarily makes an opponent an easier target for more mobile teammates to pursue.",
    "- It can check around corners for flanking opponents and scan behind obstacles or within suspicious puddles of the opponents' ink for any sharking opponents.",
    "- If you are about to get splatted, or if you fall into any unwinnable situation, tagging the opponent with a Point Sensor will track your would-be splatter, providing your teammates the opportunity for a revenge splat.",
    "- Point Sensors will only locate opponents that are directly in the radius upon hitting the ground, so be sure to throw the Point Sensor directly at an opponent.",
    "- The Kraken will grant the user instant invincibility for five seconds when activated, making it a useful panic option when you are cornered or otherwise about to get splatted - or even hit by a Disruptor, which in most cases means you are about to get splatted anyway. Kraken will keep you alive in these situations and allow you to either escape or counterattack.[1]",
    "- Jumping into opponents will splat them in one hit. However, some weapons are difficult to engage head-on as their quick fire rate will push you back.",
    "- Keep in mind that Krakens can not go over grates - on some maps, attempting to go over a grate while in Kraken form will lead to you splatting yourself by falling off the map.",
    "- It is possible to use Kraken while riding the Tower in Tower Control to squeeze out a few more points. However, you may get knocked off if the opponent shoots from the right angle.",
    "- When Kraken expires, you cannot move for a brief period of time - around 0.75 seconds. Either escape to a safe area before the special ends, or find a way to quickly finish off nearby opponents.",
    "- Super Jumping to a teammate in trouble and activating Kraken can be a funny way to assist them or otherwise get a revenge splat. This is particularly effective when you have Stealth Jump equipped.[1]",
    "- Their one-hit-splat offers its user's team chances of instantly gaining a numbers advantage, from which a game-winning push can arise.",
    "- Their lethal explosion provides space for its user's team to either push into an area held by the opponent or stall an opponent's push.",
    "- Kraken cannot inflict damage on longer ranged opponents, such as a Killer Wail or Inkstrike can.",
    "- Kraken are inefficient at turfing due leaving only a thin trail of ink, meaning the user will have a harder time taking back turf",
    "- When tagged with an opponent's Point Sensor, either briefly keep a distance from opponents to avoid getting splatted or lure the opponents away from the objective or an important area of the stage, allowing teammates to reclaim turf, push the objective, or ambush opponents.",
    "- Be mindful of both when the opponent has a Kraken ready and when it is used:\nSometimes it may be preferable to force out a Kraken from a Neo Sploosh-o-matic user early, so that when you fight them they do not have a Kraken at their disposal to quickly reverse the situation.\nSome weapons with a high fire rate can attempt to \"tame\" the Kraken by repeatedly attacking it when it rushes at you, keeping it at bay.\nStanding on a grate will protect you from a Kraken, but make sure to stay far enough away that the Kraken cannot simply jump at you to splat you if there is solid ground underneath the grate.\nSometimes, swimming away and stalling from a Kraken can be effective, as once the Neo Sploosh-o-matic user runs out of time, they will not be able to flee or fight back for a brief period.",

    "- Sometimes, swimming away and stalling from a Kraken can be effective, as once the Neo Sploosh-o-matic user runs out of time, they will not be able to flee or fight back for a brief period.",
    "- Its effective range of 75.64 DU[5] is shorter than that of almost every other weapon in the game, meaning that most other main weapons and bombs can zone out the Neo Sploosh-o-matic. Therefore, attempting to attack competent opponents head-on with this weapon will usually lead to a one way trip back to the spawn point.",
    "- Its poor accuracy, combined with its very short range, makes the Neo Sploosh-o-matic ineffective at hitting targets from a distance, particularly at an upward angle.",
    "- The most effective means a Neo Sploosh-o-matic user can splat opponents with the main weapon is through either timely flanking or careful sharking.",
    "- One advantage that the Neo Sploosh-o-matic has over most other weapons is its extremely high mobility, which is due to both its high movement speed while firing (0.80 DU/f) and very short lag after firing (2 frames), enabling it to move and react more rapidly.",
    "- The Neo Sploosh-o-matic is also very quick and thorough at turfing, allowing it to easily maintain map control and to spam Tenta Missiles.",
    "- The main purpose of the Squid Beakon is to provide a place for teammates and the player to Super Jump to. Place Squid Beakons in hidden places as the enemy team can destroy the Beakon by shooting at it.",
    "- The Squid Beakon can also be used as a temporary shield. If under fire, place a Squid Beakon and the shots will be blocked until the Beakon breaks.",
    "- It is recommended to only activate the Tenta Missiles at a safe distance from opponents, not only because a Tenta Missile user is vulnerable to close-range attacks but also because opponents who are further back are easier to track and home missiles on.",
    "- Sometimes, it may be more beneficial to target a specific opponent or two instead of all of them, based on their weapons, location, and situation:[6]\nOpponents wielding heavy, slow firing weapons will have a harder time escaping the missiles.\nOpponents who are bunched together are more likely to cause their teammates to receive collateral damage than those who are spread apart.\nTenta Missiles are also a reliable means of forcing opposing anchors to cede their ground and lose focus while aiming.[7] Sometimes, this is the only reliable means to push back into a zone or another important area of the stage.\nTenta Missiles can counter an opponent's Sting Ray or Booyah Bomb if anticipated early enough; an opponent will be forced to either delay or interrupt it to avoid getting splatted by the missiles, throwing off their aim.[8]",

    "- An opponent with a long-ranged weapon can more aggressively position themselves to zone out the entire shorter-ranged team.",
    "- The opposing slayers can play more aggressively, knowing that there is no long-ranged threat to pick them off from afar.",
    "- Weapons that trade turfing for range, such as the Splattershot Pro or medium- to long-ranged blasters, can complement a Neo Sploosh-o-matic very well.",
    "- Users of slayer's weapons with high special gauge requirements, such as the Kensa Splattershot Pro or the Soda Slosher (both 210p), can rely more on their main and sub weapons, knowing that their Neo Sploosh-o-matic teammate will often have Tenta Missiles ready.",
    "- Other special weapons, such as Inkjet or Sting Ray, are intended for splatting opponents and more capable at this than are Tenta Missiles.",
    "- Tenta Missiles cannot reliably turf highly contested areas of the stage as well as certain other special weapons, such as Bomb Launcher or Ink Storm.",
    "- If under attack by a Neo Sploosh-o-matic, try to get out of their range. Because a Neo Sploosh-o-matic has no bomb and Tenta Missiles, they will get splatted or either be forced to retreat.",
    "- Keep track of all four members of the opposing team – which ones are present, which ones are splatted, and which ones are back at their spawn point.",
    "- Check the map periodically for opposing ink forming around flanks to anticipate a flanking attack.",
    "- To prevent sharking, check suspicious puddles of the opponents' ink, preferably with a thrown sub weapon.",
    "- Launching Tenta Missiles just before a push can cause opponents to scatter, giving your team opportunities to pick off any opponents caught fleeing the Missiles.",
    "- Firing Tenta Missiles on defense can help stall an opponent's push, but make sure that your teammates are nearby the front lines to follow the Missiles up.",
    "- Launching Tenta Missiles while a teammate is using a special designed to splat opponents, such as Sting Ray or Inkjet, can limit the opponents' escape options and even prevent them from Super Jumping to safety.",
    "- As of version 3.0.0, Ninja Squid reduces the maximum swim speed of the Neo Sploosh-o-matic from 2.02 units per frame to 1.81 units per frame.",
    "- 16 ability points – one main and two subs – increase the swim speed from 2.02 to 2.19 units per frame.",
    "- Swim Speed Up can reduce the swim speed penalty from Ninja Squid. However, it takes at least 28 ability points – either one main and six subs or about two mains and three subs – of Swim Speed Up to fully offset the swimming speed penalty of Ninja Squid.",
    "- Therefore, a Neo Sploosh-o-matic user with Ninja Squid will have to decide between either having fewer ability points available for other abilities or swimming at less than the base maximum speed. For example, just 13 ability points – one main and one sub – are enough to restore the swim speed of a Neo Sploosh-o-matic user with Ninja Squid to 1.92 units per frame."
