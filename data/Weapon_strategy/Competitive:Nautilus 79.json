    "The Nautilus 79, like its silver counterpart, the Nautilus 47, is a unique splatling with its defining trait being able to store any amount of charge for an extended time, similarly to a Goo Tuber.",
    "The many unique traits of the Nautilus 79 make it a slayer:",
    "Suction Bombs can be used in a similar fashion to Splat Bombs, with a few differences:",
    "If piloted properly, the Inkjet can pressure opponents – particularly anchors – more directly than most other slayer's special weapons, such as Tenta Missiles:",
    "While a Nautilus 79 is capable of turfing, it spends most of its time holding on to a charge, so its user will have to rely on their teammates to maintain map control for them to move about the map to remain an effective player. Not having enough turfing ability presents its own set of problems:[8]",
    "Inkjet is particularly vulnerable while flying, due to its larger hitbox and slow air speed. Having a teammate with Ink Armor will increase the Inkjet's survivability and allow them to play more aggressively.",
    "Gear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.",
    "Ever since its introduction in version 4.3.0, Bomb Defense Up DX will not only reduce the damage taken from opposing sub and special weapons that are not one-hit-splat but will also reduce the duration of the tracking effects of certain opponent's sub and special weapons, such as Point Sensors and Ink Mines, allowing the user of this ability to evade detection more easily. Just three ability points, or one sub, offer plenty of utility:[11][12]",
    "A Nautilus 79 user is expected to come in contact with the opponent's ink on various surfaces, which can both be damaging and reduce mobility. Ink Resistance Up not only partially offsets the reduction in mobility but also delays the damage taken from contact with opposing ink.[11][12]",
    "Although the Nautilus 79 can recharge while firing, having some extra bullets in the charge can make a difference when it comes to finishing off opponents. Main Power Up will increase the firing duration of the Nautilus 79 by up to 30%, giving it more bullets to fire in the charge and also making it more ink efficient, as the ink consumption remains the same despite firing more bullets.",
    "Quick Super Jump decreases both the \"charge\" time before and the travel time of a Super Jump. Both aggressive and supportive Nautilus 79 users will benefit since Quick Super Jump allows them to both return to the front lines more quickly and escape unfavorable situations more easily to preserve special gauge progress.[11][12]",
    "While Run Speed Up is the bread and butter of most splatling builds, the Nautilus 79 does not need as much compared to others due to its ability to store a charge.[3] Nonetheless, some Run Speed Up will still benefit the user, mostly due to its increased mobility while firing.",
    "Being able to store a charge while swimming is the biggest part of the Nautilus 79's gameplay. Swim Speed Up enables its user to more quickly close the distance towards an opponent, more quickly respond to an opponents' push, or even escape unfavorable situations.",
    "Not recommended. Ninja Squid does not hide the glow from a held charge.\n[15]",
    "When Nautilus 79 released until the 5.0s, the Mini Splatling and Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau were considered better splatlings than it and the weapon had a very small playerbase at the time.",
    "When the latter weapons were nerfed, Inket's potential to be chained with Ink armor was found thanks to the L-3 Nozzlenose D in version 5.0.0, L-3 itself was nerfed the following patch, and more players started using it. Nautilus 79 started being used as the far and away second best Inkjet weapon.",
    "As the L-3 Nozzlenose D was getting pushed out of the meta with the rise of the endgame meta that started around version 5.4.0, the Nautilus 79 took its place as the main Inkjet weapon due to its ability to play around its kit to get high special output, solid mobility with its charge hold, and ability to shred through the short range shooters with its high shot velocity and fast fire rate along with inkjet to get rid of or displace the Jet Squelcher and Foil Squeezer.",
    "Post-Splatoon 2, the weapon's complexity makes it unpopular among Splatoon 2's remaining players. However for any Ranked Battles or League Battles found which have players able to handle its complexity, its very popular.",
    "- Just like every splatling, the Nautilus 79 has to charge before it can fire.\nUnlike most charging weapons, the Nautilus 79's range is always the same regardless of charge.\nCharging takes 38 frames (about 0.63 seconds) to reach the first full level and an additional 38 frames (another 0.63 seconds) to reach the second level.\nWhile charging, the user's running speed is set to 0.4 units per frame, which is as slow as a Custom Hydra Splatling. However, this issue doesn't matter as much since this weapon can store its charge while swimming.\nLike the Ballpoint Splatling, the Nautilus 79 can recharge while in the middle of firing.",
    "- Once charged, the Nautilus 79's high firing rate (one shot every 4 frames = 15 shots per second), moderate damage (32 health points, or HP), and extremely high bullet velocity (44.333 units per frame) allow it to mow down opponents near and far:\nWhile the Nautilus 79's firepower is devastating up close, it is still recommended to keep shorter ranged opponents from getting too close, where their potentially faster time to splat will allow them to either trade or win a confrontation outright.\nUnlike other splatlings, the accuracy remains the same even while jumping, allowing it to jump and dodge enemy fire without sacrificing its splatting power.",
    "- The most important tool of the Nautilus 79 is its ability to store charges, both full and partial, for 3.33 seconds.\nMake sure to keep an eye on both the ink tank and your charge level before committing to a fight to ensure that you have enough ink and bullets to splat an opponent.\nWhile most splatlings would hide behind an obstacle to charge and strafe out while firing, the Nautilus 79 can instead swim out and fire, offsetting its low running speed while charging and is also faster than most splatlings.[3]\nSince ink does not recover while storing a charge, sometimes it is best to drop the charge and let the ink tank refill, especially since the Nautilus 79 charges five times slower when out of ink.",

    "- They can attach to surfaces, which both allows more room for error when aiming and enables the planting of craftier traps, such as underneath a grate.",
    "- They take two seconds after attaching to a surface to detonate, as opposed to one second for a Splat Bomb, so plant Suction Bombs earlier than usual.",
    "- They inflict more damage from a direct hit (220 HP) and have a larger overall radius of damage (80 DU).",
    "- They can be thrown to lead a push into a Splat Zone or any other important area of the stage, such as the opponents' street or platform.",
    "- They can also flush out opposing anchors from perches and clear other critical areas, such as the Tower.[4]",
    "- They can also be used to poke at and zone out opponents during the neutral phase, stall an opponent's push, or provide space to escape.",
    "- A Suction Bomb can damage or destroy an opponent's brella shield, Splash Wall, or Baller or the Rainmaker shield, while detonating on contact.\nAny opponents caught within the Suction Bomb's explosion will get damaged or splatted.[5]\nIt will also inflate or pop a teammate's bubbles but deflate or diffuse an opponent's bubbles, while still detonating on contact.[6]",
    "- An opponent's Splashdown or Booyah Bomb will defuse any Suction Bombs it touches, so hold off throwing them until after the special weapon finishes.",
    "- Note that due to the playstyle of the Nautilus 79, which often involves holding onto a charge, Suction Bombs may not be used as frequently compared to other weapons.[7]",
    "- Any opponents caught within the Suction Bomb's explosion will get damaged or splatted.[5]",
    "- It will also inflate or pop a teammate's bubbles but deflate or diffuse an opponent's bubbles, while still detonating on contact.[6]",
    "- Upon activation, its launching point is marked for all players – teammates and opponents – to see and, as of version 3.2.0, also indicates when its user will return via Super Jump, allowing an opponent to camp or shark there. Therefore, it is advised to launch the Inkjet from a less visible and better-protected area.\nDrop Roller allows its user to better dodge either a potential Inkjet punish or a simple super jump punish, providing a safer landing.\nSpecials are also free ink reloads, allowing the Nautilus 79 user to drop a Suction Bomb upon landing after the special ends.",
    "- Its movement speed is determined by both the Nautilus 79's strafing speed and the number of Run Speed Up ability points equipped.",
    "- It is also possible to morph into squid/octopus form and swim (in friendly ink) while the special is active. This provides some key benefits:\nMorphing will halt the jets to enable the pilot to descend, making them a less predictable target.\nSwimming is faster than flying, enabling an Inkjet pilot to activate the special at a farther distance from opponents and more quickly pursue them.",
    "- Its altitude depends on the elevation of the surface it is hovering above, enabling it to either fly very high over an elevated structure, such as the glass roof in Shellendorf Institute, or hover high enough to challenge an opponent on a perch.\nHowever, the Inkjet cannot achieve thrust off of grates or mesh, causing its pilot to merely walk on them. Avoid hovering over them to maintain altitude.\nPressing the  button will provide a temporary extra thrust. Mastery of both boosting and descending (see above) is necessary for Inkjet pilots to become less predictable for long-ranged opponents to track and pick off.",
    "- Its mobility enables it to reach areas that are otherwise not easily accessible — or even inaccessible, such as over the glass enclosures in Kelp Dome.",
    "- The Inkjet's cannon fires long-ranged, Rainmaker-like bursts of ink that splat opponents in one direct hit or two to four indirect hits:\nLead the Inkjet's shots to compensate for their slightly slower travel speed, especially when positioned farther from an intended target.\nIts splash damage can splat opponents positioned behind obstacles, varying from 30 to 50 damage; the closer the shot to the opponent, the more damage it deals.",
    "- If an Inkjet falls out of bounds, such as into the water, its pilot will land back onto the location of launch — or the most previous point of solid ground. Therefore, the Inkjet can save a player from an out-of-bounds splat in a pinch. You can also use this to your advantage. When being pressured by the enemy team, going into water can save you from being splatted.",
    "- Drop Roller allows its user to better dodge either a potential Inkjet punish or a simple super jump punish, providing a safer landing.",

    "- Its splash damage can splat opponents positioned behind obstacles, varying from 30 to 50 damage; the closer the shot to the opponent, the more damage it deals.",
    "- A team whose composition lacks enough turfing ability can be rendered immobile if the other team dominates map control.",
    "- A lack of turfing also makes it difficult to alter the course of a game, even after wiping out the other team.",
    "- The Nautilus 79 does not like to deal with Burst Bombs, as the instant explosion of ink reduces their mobility. However, weapons with Splash Wall, particularly the Kensa .52 Gal, can mitigate this weakness.[1]",
    "- Since approaching a Nautilus 79 head-on results in quickly being shredded by its high bullet velocity, flanking it and catching it off guard is the safer option.",
    "- A long-ranged weapon, such as a charger or most splatlings, can attack a Nautilus 79 from long distance with impunity. However, once the Nautilus gets close, the tables are turned, as it can outdraw its less mobile, slower firing opponent.",
    "- The Nautilus 79 requires friendly ink to function. Since it lacks range when compared to other splatlings, it needs to use its unique held charge mechanic to swim up and get into range to fire. Maintaining map control and painting over areas will hinder its ability to get picks.",
    "- When pursuing an opposing Nautilus 79, be wary of any Suction Bomb traps the opponent may have planted, such as around a corner or under a grate.",
    "- If an opposing Nautilus 79 user throws a Suction Bomb onto the Tower while you are riding it, you can move to the other side of the Tower and use the stake for cover from the blast. However, be ready to fend off any opponents – including the opposing Nautilus 79 user – who attempt to attack this other side.[9]",
    "- Bomb Defense Up DX reduces the splash damage from both Suction Bombs (from 30 HP to 28.6 HP) and Inkjet shots (near misses go from 50 HP to 48.3 HP and splash damage goes from 30 HP to 29 HP),[10] improving its user's survivability against both the sub and special weapons of an opposing Nautilus 79 user.[11][12]",
    "- Inkjet pilots are easy targets for long-ranged weapons such as splatlings and especially chargers, due to their low mobility and larger hitbox.[13]",
    "- The splash damage of most bombs is reduced from 30 HP to 28.6 HP. This reduction in damage provides two benefits:\nIt prevents its user from being exposed on their opponents' map by the splash damage of most single bombs.\nInk Armor will not break due to splash damage from a single bomb whose splash damage normally inflicts 30 HP of damage.",
    "- The splash damage of near-misses from either Tenta Missiles or Inkjet, the minimum splash damage of bubbles, and the collision damage from Baller are all reduced from 50 HP to 48.3 HP,[10] enabling one to survive two hits from any of these specific means of special weapon damage.",
    "- It prevents its user from being exposed on their opponents' map by the splash damage of most single bombs.",
