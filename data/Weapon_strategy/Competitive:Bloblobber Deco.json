    "The Bloblobber Deco is the only variant of the Bloblobber. The weapon itself with its long range is great for the anchor role while the kit can also help provide a supportive role.",
    "The Bloblobber Deco is a long-ranged weapon with high damage, making it a quick splat if all bubbles land.",
    "The Sprinkler can be used in a variety of ways to help its user:",
    "When used at the right time, the Suction-Bomb Launcher can turn the tide of a battle:",
    "The Bloblobber Deco is best paired with slayers with short range like Kensa Splattershot or Clear Dapple Dualies to help deal pressure and maybe deal damage.",
    "The Bloblobber Deco's lack of lethal bombs – particularly either Splat or Suction Bombs – generally necessitates its user's teammates to equip weapons that include them. Lethal bombs provide their user's team a couple advantages over another team that has no lethal bombs in its composition:",
    "The Suction-Bomb Launcher is very effective at contesting territory, such as Splat Zones, but is not as reliable at splatting opponents who actively avoid the bombs. Attempting to pursue certain opponents with Suction-Bomb Launcher active further risks getting splatted. Therefore, it is advised to have other special weapons available to complement Suction-Bomb Launcher, as having too many users of any Bomb Launcher variant (no more than two) in a team composition will limit a team's arsenal of weapons:",
    "Coordinating with your teammates can greatly increase the Suction-Bomb Launcher's effect during a battle:",
    "Gear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.",
    "Ever since its introduction in Version 4.3.0, Bomb Defense Up DX will not only reduce the damage taken from opposing sub and special weapons that are not one-hit-splat but will also reduce the duration of the tracking effects of certain opponent's sub and special weapons, such as Point Sensors and Ink Mines, allowing the user of this ability to evade detection more easily. Because the Bloblobber Deco has such a low strafing speed, it's likely to get caught in the splash damage radius of most bombs, and so its user can greatly benefit from reducing the damage taken from said bombs. Just three ability points, or one sub, offer plenty of utility:",
    "The Bloblobber Deco consumes 8% of its ink per slosh, which uses up its ink tank quickly. Ink Saver (Main) can be used to help maintain ink levels:",
    "Last-Ditch Effort is a Headgear-exclusive ability that, under specific conditions, grants its user 1 to 24 ability points each of the following abilities:",
    "These abilities only begin to take effect under either of the following conditions:",
    "The Bloblobber Deco consumes ink rapidly, and Sprinklers use 60% of the ink tank. A Bloblobber Deco user will benefit a lot from Last-Ditch Effort to allow themselves to continually turf with a reduced risk of being caught without ink.",
    "This ability will increase the weapon's ink coverage, which makes the paint of the Bloblobber Deco's projectiles more consistent. This improvement is quite helpful, as it increases the user's efficiency when turfing and can contribute to the charging of your special. [7]",
    "Special Charge Up accelerates building up the special gauge for the Suction Bomb Launcher. In order for a Bloblobber Deco to help support its teammates, Special Charge Up can be used to ensure its Bomb Launcher special is ready more often.",
    "When splatted, half of the special gauge progress is lost. For example, a player with a fully charged 190p special will lose 95p of special gauge upon being splatted. Special Saver allows its user to save more of their special gauge progress whenever they are splatted. This allows a Bloblobber Deco user to more quickly rebuild its Suction Bomb Launcher after respawning.",
    "The blobs from the Bloblobber Deco travel far and remain on the stage for a decent period of time. Opponents will often run into stray blobs without getting splatted, or a volley of blobs directed at an opponent will only land one hit. Thermal Ink can make use of this and locate opponents who only mostly avoid or get randomly hit by the weapon's blobs.",
    "- Like other sloshers, tapping the  will allow the user to launch a trail of ink.\nUnlike other sloshers, the Bloblobber Deco launches four, delayed bubbles of ink, each dealing 30 damage.\nTo splat opponents quickly, a Bloblobber Deco user will have to time shots as hitting an opponent with only one bubble will deal only 30 damage, allowing an opponent to quickly splat the user.",
    "- The Bloblobber Deco has a few notable strengths\nMost notably is its turfing, which can contest areas and take map control quickly.\nWith its range, the Bloblobber Deco user can stay safely from behind and still turf the front lines.\nIts turfing allows the user to quickly build up the special gauge, allowing for more frequent Suction-Bomb Launchers.\nBe sure to not just aim aimlessly to turf, as opponents can easily take advantage of this.\nWith its delayed shots, the user can hold an area extremely well.\nThe delayed shots will force opponents out. The four bubbles can easily splat an opponent or deal damage to them quickly.\nA Bloblobber Deco user should also take advantage of bouncing its projectiles off walls. On stages like Walleye Warehouse and Port Mackerel, this can be used to maintain map-control or force some engaging opponents to flee.",
    "- The Bloblobber Deco has a few notable drawbacks.\nThe user will have to be careful of their surroundings, as they can easily be rushed down.\nWhile flinging ink, the user has a low run speed which can be exploited.\nThe Bloblobber Deco's ink consumption can punish the user if caught unaware\nFlinging ink aimlessly should be avoided. The user can easily waste ink and get caught with no ink when in a confrontation\nInk Saver (Main) can help reduce the chance of being caught without ink.",

    "- Ink Saver (Main) can help reduce the chance of being caught without ink.",
    "- Turfing areas that are either out of reach or unsafe to approach, building up the special gauge.",
    "- Maintaining turf onto highly contested areas, such as on the Tower. A Sprinkler placed high on a wall or ceiling can also be a distraction for an opponent.",
    "- Acting as a light shield in a pinch. Sprinklers have 120 hit points but are easily destroyed by opponents armed with Object Shredder.",
    "- Using any Bomb Launcher too close to an opponent will leave its user vulnerable to attack, so activate it outside the opponents' range.",
    "- Suction-Bomb Launcher can either capture or hold onto a zone or another important area of the map, such as around the opponents' clam basket.",
    "- It can also stall or stop an opponent's Tower push in a more direct manner than Sting Ray does. Note that attempting to stop the Tower in this manner forces you to be closer to the Tower, whereas Sting Ray can be used from a further, safer distance.",
    "- Suction-Bomb Launcher can quickly pop the Rainmaker shield to instantly start or restart a Rainmaker push.",
    "- Launched bombs can damage or destroy an opponent's brella shield, Splash Wall, or Baller or the Rainmaker shield, while detonating on contact.\nAny opponents caught within a bomb's explosion will get damaged or splatted .[4]\nIt will also inflate or pop a teammate's bubbles but deflate or diffuse an opponent's bubbles, while still detonating on contact.[5]",
    "- An opponent's Splashdown or Booyah Bomb will defuse any Suction Bombs it comes in contact with. If possible, hold off activating Suction-Bomb Launcher until after the opponents have exhausted their special weapons first.",

    "- It will also inflate or pop a teammate's bubbles but deflate or diffuse an opponent's bubbles, while still detonating on contact.[5]",
    "- Because of the Bloblobber Deco's high range, a Bloblobber Deco user can stay back and keep control while the rest of the weapons with short range can go to the frontlines.",
    "- A Bloblobber Deco user can still be offensive in the backlines. Because of their delayed shots, the shots can get to the opponent's area while traveling and apply pressure.",
    "- Their one-hit-splat offers its user's team chances of instantly gaining a numbers advantage, from which a game-winning push can arise.",
    "- Their lethal explosion provides space for its user's team to either push into an area held by the opponent or stall an opponent's push.",
    "- Other than the launched bombs, a Bomb Launcher user has no means of protection and is particularly vulnerable to long-ranged fire.",
    "- Other special weapons, such as Inkjet or Sting Ray, are intended for splatting opponents and more capable at this than is a Bomb Launcher.",
    "- Ink Armor can increase the survivability of a Suction-Bomb Launcher user, freeing them to push the opponents further back. If a teammate has a weapon that can farm Ink Armor, it might pay off to wait until they activate it.",
    "- Remaining behind a teammate with an active protective special weapon, such as Baller or Bubble Blower, can also give a Suction-Bomb Launcher user room to operate.",
    "- Pushing forward with Suction-Bomb Launcher while a teammate is using a special designed to splat opponents, such as Sting Ray or Inkjet, can limit the opponents' escape options and even prevent them from Super Jumping to safety.",
    "- Since the Bloblobber Deco has very long range, using something that outranges it, such as the Dynamo Roller or the Hydra Splatling, can get the Bloblobber Deco splatted.",
    "- The Bloblobber also has a slow fire rate and its shots are in a line and delayed, so using dualies, preferably Dualie Squelchers, or anything else with high mobility to dodge the bubbles.\nTake advantage on how the blobs are delayed. Compared to the Slosher, it takes more time for the blobs to hit an opponent than the Slosher. The extra time can be used to splat the Bloblobber",
    "- A Bloblobber Deco user who is aimlessly flinging ink can easily be taken advantage of.\nTheir ink can be inked over, which can be an excellent way to build up the special gauge. Take advantage of a Bloblobber Deco's ink to build up the special gauge to counterattack.",
    "- The Sprinkler can also deal 20 damage, so try to destroy it as soon as possible, but beware of incoming opponents.",
    "- When using the Suction-Bomb Launcher, the user can use their main weapon, so be careful and try to keep a safe distance.",
    "- If you happen to get within range to an opposing Bomb Launcher user, then take them out quickly to interrupt the special.",
    "- Splashdown and Booyah Bomb, if timed properly, can negate the Suction Bombs of a Suction-Bomb Launcher.",
    "- A counter Bomb Launcher can nullify the effects of Suction-Bomb Launcher, preventing its user's team from either capping a zone or continuing a push.",

    "- The splash damage of most bombs is reduced from 30 HP to 28.6 HP. This reduction in damage provides two benefits:\nIt prevents its user from being exposed on their opponents' map by the splash damage of most single bombs.\nInk Armor will not break due to splash damage from a single bomb whose splash damage normally inflicts 30 HP of damage.",
    "- The splash damage of near-misses from either Tenta Missiles or Inkjet, the minimum splash damage of bubbles, and the collision damage from Baller are all reduced from 50 HP to 48.3 HP, enabling one to survive two hits from any of these specific means of special weapon damage.",

    "- There are at most 30 seconds remaining on the game clock, or Overtime has begun in a Ranked Battle, at which the maximum 24 ability points will be granted for each of the above abilities.",
    "- In a Ranked Battle, the opposing team's countdown has at most 50 points remaining. The effects of Last-Ditch Effort increase as the opposing team's countdown decreases from 50 to 30 points remaining, starting with 1 ability point for each ability and maxing out to 24 ability points.",
    "- Just 6 ability points, or two subs, are enough to increase the amount of special gauge progress saved from 50% to 64.6%."
