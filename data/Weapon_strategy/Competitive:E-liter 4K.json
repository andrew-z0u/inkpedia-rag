    "The E-liter 4K is a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3, a successor to Splatoon's E-liter 3K. It is a charger-type weapon that sacrifices mobility, ink consumption, and charge time for extreme range that is only outclassed by its scoped variant.",
    "Like most chargers, this weapon can store a fully charged shot in swim form for a short amount of time, and a fully charged shot will pierce through opponents.",
    "The E-liter 4K is a charger that outranges most of its kind. Based on the E-liter 3K, it was introduced in the second game of the franchise and continued into the third. The weapon has a scope variant, E-liter 4K Scope.",
    "- The E-liter 4K is used as an Anchor, and shoots from afar to support the team. The weapon itself has the advantage of holding a charge, far range, and a one-shot mechanic that can obliterate enemies when given a direct hit. To use, holding  will create a build-up of ink, and letting go of the  will release this charged shot. It will take 1.53 seconds to fully charge, and the less the player holds on to , the less effective the shot will be.",
    "- In addition to the charging mechanic, going into squid form by pressing  while holding  will activate the swimming while holding charge technique. The charge will be held for up to 1.25 seconds while submerged.",
    "- Tap shots are also an option for players who want to be out on the battlefield a little more. Tap shotting is the act of hitting an opponent multiple times by mashing the  button. This is normally a last resort for players who are trying to get out of a head-to-head combat situation that needs to be dealt with. This attack doesn't always defuse the situation and the charger may be splatted- especially when dealing with a rapid-shooting Shooter or Blaster.",
    "- Techniques for hitting an enemy include:\nPressing  to jump, which can enhance the user's aim and help them to get a shot while hiding behind a small obstacle and obstructions of view.\nUsing the basic mechanic of holding  can help competitive and more relaxed players get a splat.\nUsing the submerged in ink trick, a sneaky strike can be pulled by swimming near the opponent and splatting them. There are two cons of this tactic, though.\nA) All chargers glow while holding , and this can be seen while swimming in ink.\nB) If in a situation with more than one opponent present, splatting an enemy secretly reveals the charger's current position and may cause backlash from the other enemy from the opposing team.",
    "- Painting turf is something that the E-liter 4K isn't especially gifted in. Inking abilities while tap-shotting the ground (using the previously stated method of mashing ) and walking sideways can provide a brief coat of ink, but doing this causes the ground to have many holes and inconsistencies that aren't desirable for good coverage.",
    "- The Ink Mine can be used as not only a tracker, but a last resort. If an enemy with quite a lot of damage is attacking, place an Ink Mine in the path. The mine will explode and splat the enemy. The mines can also be used to guard the area of the charger when unable to use peripheral vision.",
    "- The Ink Storm can provide security in the location it is set off in. Using this special, the enemy can perish if in the direct rain for too long. This helps support teammates such as Slayers and others.",
    "- As a result of the E-liter 4K being an Anchor, teammates of the player will have the advantage of the mid and base area being watched and protected unless there is a push to the enemy base.",
    "- Teammates of this weapon should not crowd the charger, and instead continue their roles to better the ambush of the opposing team. The charger can handle most enemies (depending on the skill of the user) therefore covering a portion of the map singlehandedly.",
    "- If other teammates with the same Anchor role are present, the similar players should spread across the map to enhance the range of the team. This can help the team claim the middle-ground.",
    "- The E-liter 4K has a slow charge time, and fast shooting weapons have the capacity to hide and attack an unsuspecting charger while defenseless. Some maps have easy access charger spots, and learning where they are can help players take down powerful enemies.",
    "- Fellow long-range weapons can splat the E-liter 4K, and sneak attacks are good ways to eliminate foes that focus on other targets rather than direct threats.",
    "- Sloshers such as Exploshers, Bloblobbers, and Sloshing Machines have long-range immediate impact attacks that can take out this weapon quickly without many consequences. Using these weapons can eliminate not only the charger, but a viable member of the enemy team.",
    "Different gear abilities that complement the E-liter 4K in Splatoon 2 are:",
    "Ink Recovery Up helps the charger user amplify the amount of shots that can be made in a time period. This will also amplify the use of Ink Mines when being placed, allowing the player to recover faster from using a sub weapon.",
    "Using Ink Resistance Up helps a charger get out of a tight spot with more ease. Being caught in enemy ink slows the player down and gives the play 50 damage, but this ability reduces the amount of damage down to 30. This lets the player get out quicker and stray from being splatted a little better.",
    "Ink Saver (Main) allows the player to reduce the amount of ink the main weapon takes up. This benefits the charger similarly to Ink Recovery Up, and will positively effect the player's ink usage.",
    "Respawn Punisher is a double-edged sword for most weapons, but chargers have an advantage since they take up the Anchor role. Respawn Punisher causes the respawn time to increase and the special gauge bar to lower more significantly than normal when the player using the ability and the player they splat is splatted. Due to the fact that the E-liter 4K is normally on a perch that isn't always easily accessible to the average player, the charger can punish their enemies without receiving much retaliation.",
    "The E-liter 4K is a charger that outranges most of its kind. Based on the E-liter 4K, it was introduced in the second game of the franchise and continued into the third. The weapon has a scope variant, E-liter 4K Scope.",

    "- While on a team with an E-liter 4K or playing as one, utilize the area the charger user is protecting. Keep an eye on the enemies, and bring the enemy over by grabbing their attention.",
    "- Anyone in the charger's range can be splatted if their attack was executed correctly.",
    "- If there are more than one Anchor role teammates, split up and cover more ground. Avoid leaving an unguarded area when there are Anchors in one spot. An E-liter 4K has the capability to shoot incoming enemies, and there is no need to leave a strong weapon with two players.",
    "- Shooters, Blasters, and other frontline weapons perform well with weakened enemies, thus providing a use for tap-shotting quick-moving enemies.",
    "- To stop the E-liter 4K, fighting from behind is a more reliable approach. The E-liter is generally defenseless from behind, and, especially when the user has no shot charged, cannot react promptly.",
    "- Fellow Anchor players can \"1 v. 1\" in some manners the E-liter 4k, and if the user has a more advanced approach they may be able to splat the opposing E-liter.",
    "- Sloshers can effectively 1-2 shot this weapon well due to their range and general power. Weapons like the Bloblobber (and variants), Explosher, and the Sloshing Machine (and variants) all have a powerful capacity to destroy enemies efficiently when used correctly. In the terms of the E-liter 4K, the Slosher weapons can broadly splat the charger with more ease than most Shooters.",
    "- The Blaster weapon class (especially the Clash Blaster variants) have a 1-2 shot splat that has a special capability; two half damage shots. While many weapons can shoot twice at an enemy, the Blasters can send their shots in the proximity of the opponent. Because the charger usually maintains distance from the battlefield, most Blasters benefit from the space because this distance allows the weapon protection and other aids.[2]",
