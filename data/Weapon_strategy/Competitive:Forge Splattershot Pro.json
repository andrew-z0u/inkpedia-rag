    "Gear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.",
    "The Forge Splattershot Pro is one of many weapons to benefit highly from Damage Up, turning its three-hit kill into a two-hit kill to slightly damaged opponents.",
    "It's also worth noting that more Damage Up must be used in order to counteract the effects of Defense Up.",
    "Swim Speed Up is a versatile ability that can fit any type of playstyle. For a Forge Splattershot Pro user, it can allow them to quickly get to key areas of the map and maintain a safe distance from shorter ranged opponents when engaging in combat with them.",
    "One of the main drawbacks of the Forge Splattershot Pro is its high ink consumption and mediocre turfing. This combined with its high special count of 220p mean that it will rarely get its special, Inkzooka. Running Special Charge Up will ensure that a Forge Splattershot Pro user gets their special more often, giving them to opportunity to surprise oncoming opponents and take out longer ranged foes.",
    "The Forge Splattershot Pro is often seen as a beginner's Foil Squeezer, or for those who are unable to mash buttons[6]. While it has less range, turfing, and accuracy than the Foil Squeezer, it does not require continuous presses of . Due to its kit, the Forge Splattershot Pro has a more supportive playstyle than its pure slayer variant, the Kensa Splattershot Pro.",
    "Suction Bombs can be used in a similar fashion to Splat Bombs, with a few differences:",
    "Bubbles launched from the Bubble Blower can turf surfaces and splat opponents when popped, but they are even better at providing protection:",
    "The Forge Splattershot Pro's long range and high damage allow it to provide support fire and help maintain spatial control, despite its lack of turfing compared to most of the other weapons of a team's composition. Therefore, it is generally redundant to have more than one long-ranged weapon on a team for a few reasons:[11]",
    "Because the Forge Splattershot Pro is inefficient at turfing, its user will have to rely on their teammates to maintain map control. Not having enough turfing ability – usually from having too many blasters and chargers – presents its own set of problems:[11]",
    "Bubble Blower is great for either initiating a push into contested territory or repelling the opponents' push. However, it is neither a very reliable means of turfing territory – such as a Splat Zone – nor always a dependable means to splat opponents — particularly ones with longer-ranged weapons. Therefore, it would be redundant to have two Bubble Blower users in a team composition:[11]",
    "Besides providing protection while pushing the objective, the Bubble Blower works well in conjunction with other special weapons:",
    "Remember, teammates of a Bubble Blower user can assist by either keeping the bubbles inflated or bursting them, thanks to their 20% bonus damage inflicted on them:",
    "Gear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.",
    "Ever since its introduction in version 4.3.0, Bomb Defense Up DX will not only reduce the damage taken from opposing sub and special weapons that are not one-hit-splat but will also reduce the duration of the tracking effects of certain opponent's sub and special weapons, such as Point Sensors and Ink Mines, allowing the user of this ability to evade detection more easily. Being a slayer weapon, its user risks damage from both bombs and special weapons and can greatly benefit from reducing the damage taken from them. Just three ability points, or one sub, offer plenty of utility:[13][14]",
    "A Forge Splattershot Pro user can expect to come in contact with the opponent's ink on various surfaces, which can both be damaging and reduce mobility - especially since this weapon has poor turfing ability. Ink Resistance Up not only partially offsets the reduction in mobility but also delays the damage taken from contact with opposing ink.[13][14]",
    "Last-Ditch Effort is a headgear-exclusive ability that, under specific conditions, grants its user 1 to 24 ability points each of the following abilities:",
    "These abilities only begin to take effect under either of the following conditions:",
    "The Forge Splattershot Pro consumes ink rapidly and Suction Bombs are more often relied upon. A Forge Splattershot user can greatly benefit from both the overall reduced ink consumption and increased ink recovery.",
    "An ability exclusive to shoes, Object Shredder provides a Forge Splattershot Pro user three specific benefits:",
    "Special Power Up increases bubbles' size upon launching as well as their blast radius. The former trait enables bubbles to withstand more damage from the opponents before defusing, providing their user and their teammates a longer duration of protection.",
    "Main Power Up increases damage for the main weapon. If enough is used, the damage can reach to 49.9, making it close to a two hit splat. If an opponent touches enemy ink for more than one frame, then the Forge Splattershot Pro will be able to splat the opponent in two hits. However, due to the major commitment in gear space required for this ability so the weapon does 49.9 damage in addition to the abilities required for a typical weapon with Bubble Blower, Main Power Up is not recommended for this weapon. A gear set with Main Power Up is more suited for the Kensa Splattershot Pro due to it being more combat-oriented.",
    "The Forge Splattershot Pro upon release would be used quite often because it had the Bubble Blower. At the time, the Bubbles were massive and the Forge was the best weapon with it. The Forge would be used often until version 2.2.0, which changed its special gauge requirement from 180 to 200. Afterwards, the Forge would be used less and less often in the meta.[17]",
    "At version 3.3.0, while still not the best, the Forge would be ranked as moderate, with competitive players such as Sorin ranking it moderately on his tier list[18]. Thoughts on the weapon throughout version 4.0.0 would stay the same with Sorin placing it near the same place. The Forge at version 4.0.0 would be one of the few times it was superior to the Foil Squeezer[19]. From version 4.6.0 to version 4.8.0, the weapon would still stay near the same place, with Chara placing it at similar places. Because the weapon had to either devote gear space to either Main Power Up or Special Power Up and Object Shredder, the weapon would be missing out on one advantage, which made the weapon inferior as the other variants, which could devote gear space to Main Power Up without problems.[20]",
    "Around version 5.0.0 the ability to instapop bubbles discovered. Because of its gear devotion problem, the Forge would not be used often around here and would be bested by the Foil Squeezer, which does not need a potential two shot in order to be effective. Chara would put the Forge at version 5.3.0 slightly lower than before with the same gear problem and because of the Foil Squeezer.[21]. At version 5.5.0 the weapon would stay the same with the same problems as before. Here, the Forge would be placed higher than its vanilla variant.[22]",
    "The Forge has carried over the suction bomb from Splatoon 2, but has exchanged the Bubble Blower for a Booyah Bomb. The Suction Bomb gives the Forge a certain versatility not possessed by the base Pro Kit, and the Booyah Bomb is a great zone control tool. While this comes at the cost of higher ink consumption, and a costlier special, the Forge is an excellent kit, and an attractive choice for any prospective Pro user.",
    "The Forge retains most of the base kit's defining traits and thus much of what applies to the Pro applies to the Forge Pro.",
    "Same as Splatoon 2, the Forge Splattershot Pro's long range and high damage make it suited for fire support and spatial control for a few reasons.",
    "Because the Forge Splattershot Pro is inefficient at turfing, its user will have to rely on their teammates to maintain map control. Not having enough turfing ability – usually from having too many blasters and chargers – presents its own set of problems:[11]",
    "Like the base kit, the Forge Splattershot Pro has good range and damage, but several other weapons surpass one or both of these capabilities. Depending on your weapon, use these facts to your advantage.",
    "Gear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.",
    "The Forge is even more ink hungry than its vanilla counterpart. Ink Saver Main is especially useful, though ink saver sub will help out with the rather costly suction bomb.",
    "The Booyah Bomb is powerful, but expensive for the Forge Pro, so you might want to consider some special charge up.",
    "A useful ability for any weapon. Two subs will increase the swim speed to match a lightweight such as the Splattershot Jr.\n[23]",
    "The Forge Splattershot Pro has 6 degrees of shot deviation while jumping. One main of this will reduce this by roughly 33%, to 3.99 degrees.[23] Not only does this help out in general, but it also assists against H-3 Nozzlenoses and Squeezers, which have similar ranges, but perfect accuracy while on the ground.",
    "The Forge Splattershot Pro has bad painting around the player's feet, so it may get stuck in enemy ink more frequently, which can sometimes be a death sentence. Also, this ability has good stacking, so one or two subs is a good investment for better mobility through enemy ink.[23]",
    "Another useful ability for any weapon, having one sub will massively cut down the startup time for a Super Jump. Just watch out for enemy chargers and splatlings if you do not have stealth jump or drop roller.[23]",
    "While not as potent as it was in Splatoon, it can still be pretty useful in some situations, like when you make a trade (and you meet the numerous conditions for activation)",
    "Has some utility for lessening the cost of death, but not all that game changing.",
    "The Splattershot Pro is a slayer, which will often need to jump back into the action. With many chargers around in the current meta, having this ability will hide the Super Jump marker from them to avoid being camped.",
    "Respawn Punisher is a double-edged sword. If you're running this, make sure you get at least get more kills than deaths, otherwise, you are making things harder for yourself.",

    "- The reduced ink efficiency and slower fire rate make the Forge Splattershot Pro a less effective turfing weapon than most other slayer/support weapons. Avoid getting surrounded by opposing ink and have an exit lane in case of a retreat.\nReduced turfing ability hinders its ability to either maintain map control or capture a Splat Zone. In general, focus on splatting opponents and rely on teammates with better turfing weapons to maintain zone or map control.[7]\nWhile the added range and Suction Bombs allow this weapon to potentially play a supportive role, the slower turfing rate combined with the high special gauge requirement for the Forge Splattershot Pro make it harder to build up its special weapon compared to most conventional support weapons.",

    "- They can also flush out opposing anchors from perches and clear other critical areas, such as the Tower.[8]",
    "- They can also be used to poke at and zone out opponents during the neutral phase, stall an opponent's push, or provide space to escape.",
    "- A Suction Bomb can damage or destroy an opponent's brella shield, Splash Wall, or Baller or the Rainmaker shield, while detonating on contact.\nAny opponents caught within the Suction Bomb's explosion will get damaged or splatted.[9]",
    "- An opponent's Splashdown or Booyah Bomb will defuse any Suction Bombs it touches, so hold off throwing them until after the special weapon finishes.",
    "- Suction Bombs can be a bit more reliable than other bombs with the Bubble Blower.\nThe main benefit is that Suction Bombs attach to surfaces providing a guaranteed spot to shoot the bubbles to. Splat Bombs may skip through the ground and go too far for the bubbles to make contact with.\nCompared to Splat Bombs, Suction Bombs take longer to explode than Splat Bombs. The extra time can be used to get the bubbles to the bomb and not waste ink.",

    "- Blowing bubbles in front of a push (e.g. Tower, Rainmaker, or Power Clam) can protect its user and any teammates from incoming opposing fire. However, just like with a Splash Wall, any bombs that hit a bubble will instantly explode, so remain behind any bubbles to avoid getting splatted by opponents' bombs.",

    "- The Forge Splattershot Pro is a formidable foe for most other weapons, due to its range and damage output. Therefore, most other weapons cannot easily defeat it in a straight one-on-one matchup and must use other means to defeat it.\nA matchup between two opposing Forge Splattershot Pro wielders will depend on skill, positioning, turf control, and the presence of any supporting players.\nTo engage a Forge Splattershot Pro with a shorter range weapon, try to catch it off guard through either careful flanking or sharking, better positioning, or wise use of bombs. Do not forget that the Forge Splattershot Pro also has Suction Bombs as well.\nBoth variants of the Splat Brella can decently counter the Forge Splattershot Pro due to the durability of their shields. Variants of the Tenta Brella are more damaging and provide more protection, provided that their shields are opened early enough. Variants of the Undercover Brella, however, are too weak to match the Forge Splattershot Pro's damage, and their shields are not sturdy enough to provide sufficient protection.\nThrowing a Suction Bomb at the Shield may destroy the shield but be careful not to waste too much ink. The Suction Bomb and the Forge Splattershot Pro both use high amounts of ink and it can leave the player's ink tank dry.\nTry to take advantage of the Forge Splattershot Pro's relative inability to turf by containing it with ink. This might require the use of sub weapons and teammates.\nA few weapons that either match or exceed the range of the Forge Splattershot Pro without sacrificing mobility can defeat one head-on. For example, both variants of the .96 Gal overpower and slightly outrange the Forge Splattershot Pro, while both variants of the Squeezer's burst fire mode outrange it. Both variants of the Dualie Squelchers match the Forge Splattershot Pro's range and can outmaneuver it with dodge rolling.",
    "- As with versus the Splattershot, long-ranged weapons, such as chargers and most splatlings, can fire upon Forge Splattershot Pro with impunity, but they must remain wary of it getting too close.",
    "- To prevent sharking, keep track of all four opponents – particularly which ones have neither been splatted nor super jumped to their spawn point – and turf suspicious puddles of opposing ink, preferably with a sub weapon. Point Sensors, while unable to turf, can expose any sharking opponents.",
    "- If the Forge Splattershot Pro user activates a Bubble Blower in an unsafe position, try attacking them, particularly with bombs and chargers.\nTenta Missiles can damage the bubbles severely, leaving the bubbles almost popped.\nA Splashdown within range can severely damage the bubbles if not destroy it outright.",

    "- First off, the three primary strengths of the main weapon are good range, good damage, and good accuracy.\nAt 3 hits to splat and an okay fire rate, the Forge Pro puts out some surprisingly decent damage. While beat out by many weapons in terms of time to kill, it is still really good when combined with...\nIts excellent range. Particularly for the shooter class, as it is one of the best. You will be out ranging a lot of close to mid range weapons (many of which just so happen to out-damage you) like the regular Splattershot, the .52 Gal, Splat Dualies, the Blaster, etc.\nThat being said the Splattershot Pro is not helpless at close range, and can hold its own up close if the situation calls for it.\nThe Forge has great accuracy as well. It is not perfect, but it can kill consistently even at its maximum effective range.",
    "- The Forge Splattershot Pro is a better turfer than the base kit due to the Suction and Booyah Bomb. It is not the best, but it is not bad either, and is pretty good at covering a Splat Zone for example.",
    "- A Pro vs Pro matchup will usually come down to skill, and whoever gets the initiative on the other. Remember, if another pro (or any other weapon for that matter) gets the jump on you, retreat is always an option. Just be sure to not get gunned down while running away.\nWhen confronting a Pro and other similarly ranged weapons, flanking and ambushing are good tools for safely picking them off.",
    "- Remember that shooting gives away your position. Sometimes it is better to simply hide in ink and wait for the enemies to come to you before picking them off, so try not to shoot randomly.",
    "- Focus fire, as in go after one enemy at a time. If you are going down, better to take one enemy down with you than partially damage two.",
    "- The Suction Bomb is an excellent sub, if rather costly. It retains much of its utility from Splatoon 2, but to demonstrate the differences between the Forge and the base kit in Splatoon 3, here is a general rundown:\nThe Suction Bomb can apply easy pressure to the enemy team, forcing them out of critical positions. Choke points, sniper perches, and the tower from Tower Control are some examples.\nIt is excellent at destroying objects, like a Splash Wall or a rainmaker shield. Notably, it makes the Forge Pro much better at this than the base Pro.\nThe Suction Bomb can be used to quickly cover up errant patches of bare ground while you are traveling towards the action.\nWhen it comes to traps, there are few better subs than the Suction Bomb. Forcing your opponent into an exploding Suction Bomb, intentionally or otherwise, is always satisfying.\nWhile not a flashy use, throwing a Suction Bomb down will generally deter the enemy from moving towards the area where the Bomb is located until after it has exploded. Use this to manipulate enemy movement, or to force them back for a few seconds.\nDo not ignore the Suction Bomb's high ink consumption. With the high ink consumption by the main weapon itself, it can be troublesome.",
    "- As a side note, the loss of the Bubble Blower means the Suction Bomb arguably no longer synergizes as well with the special weapon.",
    "- The Booyah Bomb can turn the tide of a battle if utilized correctly. It is also more expensive the base Pro's Crab Tank, so use it wisely!\nAs with any Special Weapon, do not use it as a panic button. More often than not, it will not work.\nThe Booyah Bomb is a great tool at covering splat zones, and forcing enemies off of Towers in Tower Control.\nIn addition, a well placed Booyah Bomb will either force the enemy to withdraw, or be splatted. Just because you did not get any kills does not mean you are not helping out your team",
    "- At 3 hits to splat and an okay fire rate, the Forge Pro puts out some surprisingly decent damage. While beat out by many weapons in terms of time to kill, it is still really good when combined with...\nIts excellent range. Particularly for the shooter class, as it is one of the best. You will be out ranging a lot of close to mid range weapons (many of which just so happen to out-damage you) like the regular Splattershot, the .52 Gal, Splat Dualies, the Blaster, etc.\nThat being said the Splattershot Pro is not helpless at close range, and can hold its own up close if the situation calls for it.",
    "- The Forge has great accuracy as well. It is not perfect, but it can kill consistently even at its maximum effective range.",

    "- That being said the Splattershot Pro is not helpless at close range, and can hold its own up close if the situation calls for it.",
    "- When confronting a Pro and other similarly ranged weapons, flanking and ambushing are good tools for safely picking them off.",
    "- The Suction Bomb can apply easy pressure to the enemy team, forcing them out of critical positions. Choke points, sniper perches, and the tower from Tower Control are some examples.",
    "- It is excellent at destroying objects, like a Splash Wall or a rainmaker shield. Notably, it makes the Forge Pro much better at this than the base Pro.",
    "- The Suction Bomb can be used to quickly cover up errant patches of bare ground while you are traveling towards the action.",
    "- When it comes to traps, there are few better subs than the Suction Bomb. Forcing your opponent into an exploding Suction Bomb, intentionally or otherwise, is always satisfying.",
    "- While not a flashy use, throwing a Suction Bomb down will generally deter the enemy from moving towards the area where the Bomb is located until after it has exploded. Use this to manipulate enemy movement, or to force them back for a few seconds.",
    "- Do not ignore the Suction Bomb's high ink consumption. With the high ink consumption by the main weapon itself, it can be troublesome.",
    "- As with any Special Weapon, do not use it as a panic button. More often than not, it will not work.",
    "- The Booyah Bomb is a great tool at covering splat zones, and forcing enemies off of Towers in Tower Control.\nIn addition, a well placed Booyah Bomb will either force the enemy to withdraw, or be splatted. Just because you did not get any kills does not mean you are not helping out your team",

    "- A team with too many long-ranged weapons will have fewer mobile weapons that can more quickly capture turf and wrest control of the objective, hindering its ability to begin an effective push into the opponents' territory. Such a team will also have difficulty breaking out of an opponent's spawn camp.",
    "- A team whose composition lacks enough turfing ability can be rendered immobile if the other team dominates map control.",
    "- High-damage weapons like the .52 Gal can easily outshoot the Pro if allowed to get into range. If you have a weapon with a faster kill time but shorter range than the pro, try to get the Pro into your range when it is safe to do so.\nEven weapons with relativity low damage and range like the Inkbrush can still deal with the Splattershot Pro by ambushing, so keep that in mind.\nDo not rush a Splattershot Pro head-on. It may not shred you like a Hydra Splatling, but you will still get splatted readily.",
    "- The Hydra Splatling and Heavy Splatling both have better range, damage, and accuracy than the Splattershot Pro. Keep this in mind and pick off any pick off any Splattershot Pro users before they can get into range.\nThe Ballpoint Splatling also beats the Pro out in terms of accuracy and range, though it has a slower time to kill at long range when compared to the Heavy and Hydra. Keep in mind you can always use close-range firing mode when possible, it will eviscerate the Pro up close.",
    "- Likewise the Splat Charger and the E-liter 4K have much better range than the Pro. Keep the Splattershot Pro from getting into range, and pick them off whenever possible.",
    "- In general, bombs are a good way to put pressure on long-range weapon users by forcing them to reposition. Any time the Pro isn't shooting is time you can use by advancing in on them and attacking.",
    "- The Squeezer and the H-3 Nozzlenose both have exponentially better accuracy than the Pro, giving them an advantage in one on one fights.",
    "- The Range Blaster has comparable range, but its splash damage and one hit direct make it a dangerous opponent for the Pro.",
    "- The Nautilus has comparable range, but has higher accuracy and damage output than the Pro, making it particularly troublesome for the Pro.",
    "- Even weapons with relativity low damage and range like the Inkbrush can still deal with the Splattershot Pro by ambushing, so keep that in mind.",
    "- Do not rush a Splattershot Pro head-on. It may not shred you like a Hydra Splatling, but you will still get splatted readily.",
