  "paragraphs": [
    "- The weapon is middleweight whereas in Splatoon 2 where the weapon is lightweight.",
    "- The Splash-o-matic is slightly more ink efficient consuming 0.7% of the ink tank than 0.8%.",
    "- In Splatoon, the Splash-o-matic has shot deviation when jumping instead of in Splatoon 2 where the weapon has no shot deviation when jumping, meaning that the weapon has less accuracy than in Splatoon 2.",
    "Suction Bombs can be used in a similar fashion to Splat Bombs, with a few differences:",
    "- They can attach to surfaces, which both allows more room for error when aiming and enables the planting of craftier traps, such as underneath a grate.",
    "- They take two seconds after attaching to a surface to detonate, as opposed to one second for a Splat Bomb, so plant Suction Bombs earlier than usual.",
    "- They inflict more damage from a direct hit (220 HP) and have a larger overall radius of damage (80 DU).",
    "- They can be thrown to lead a push into a Splat Zone or any other important area of the stage, such as the opponents' street or platform.",
    "- They can also flush out opposing anchors from perches and clear other critical areas, such as the Tower.",
    "- They can also be used to poke at and zone out opponents during the neutral phase, stall an opponent's push, or provide space to escape.",
    "- A Suction Bomb can damage or destroy an opponent's Splash Wall, or the Rainmaker shield, while detonating on contact.\nAny opponents caught within the Suction Bomb's explosion will get damaged or splatted.",
    "The Bomb Rush can help with maintaining leads, gaining map control, or making pushes.",
    "- Using any Bomb Rush too close to an opponent will leave its user vulnerable to attack, so activate it outside the opponents' range.",
    "- Bomb Rush can either capture or hold onto a zone or another important area of the map, such as a path to the Rainmaker pedestal.",
    "- It can also stall or stop an opponent's Tower push in a more direct manner than Killer Wail does. Note that attempting to stop the Tower in this manner forces you to be closer to the Tower, whereas Killer Wail can be used from a further, safer distance.",
    "- Bomb Rush can quickly pop the Rainmaker shield to instantly start or restart a Rainmaker push.",
    "- An opponent's Inkstrike will defuse any Suction Bombs it comes in contact with. If possible, hold off activating Bomb Rush until after the opponents have exhausted their special weapons first.",
    "The Bomb Rush is very effective at contesting territory, such as Splat Zones, but is not as reliable at splatting opponents who actively avoid the bombs. Attempting to pursue certain opponents with Bomb Rush active further risks getting splatted. Therefore, it is advised to have other special weapons available to complement Bomb Rush, as having too many users of any Bomb Rush variant (no more than two) in a team composition will limit a team's arsenal of weapons:",
    "- Other than the launched bombs, a Bomb Launcher user has no means of protection and is particularly vulnerable to long-ranged fire.",
    "- Other special weapons, such as Inkjet or Sting Ray, are intended for splatting opponents and more capable at this than is a Bomb Rush.",
    "Coordinating with your teammates can greatly increase the Bomb Rush's effect during a battle:",
    "- Remaining behind a teammate with an active protective special weapon, such as Bubbler or Kraken, can also give a Suction-Bomb Launcher user room to operate.",
    "- Pushing forward with Bomb Rush while a teammate is using a special designed to splat opponents, such as Killer Wail or Inkzooka, can limit the opponents' escape options and even prevent them from Super Jumping to safety.",
    "- If you happen to get within range to an opposing Bomb Rush user, then take them out quickly to interrupt the special.",
    "- Inkstrike, if timed properly, can negate the bombs of a Bomb Rush.",
    "- If the Splash-o-matic user activates a Bomb Rush in an unsafe position, try attacking them from a distance, as they can still use their main weapon.",
    "Gear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.",
    "Because the Splash-o-matic has a shorter range than most shooters, the Suction Bombs can also be used to take out enemies that might be lurking out of the main weapon's range. Bomb Range Up will increase the distance the bombs travel when thrown.",
    "Cold Blooded is an ability that shortens the duration of position-tracking to 50% of normal tracking time. As a stealthy, mobile weapon, Cold Blooded is immensely useful for the Splash-o-matic, enhancing its sneakiness, facilitating ambushes, preventing enemy ambushes, enabling more mobility, and preventing chargers to quickly splat players.",
    "Comeback allows players to get back faster into the battle and constantly have a boosted range of abilities at hand, further charging Special Charge after special loss from death as well.",
    "Ink Recovery Up allows players to constantly throw Suction Bombs and have a frequent presence on the map.",
    "As a short-range weapon, players will generally find themselves in enemy ink in engagements. The Ink Resistance Up ability allows players to continue to be mobile and to survive more fights without taking as much damage from enemy ink.",
    "With the weapon's fast and effective ink output, Special Charge Up allows players to have frequent Suction Bomb Rushes at hand, a valuable tool for aggressive and defensive plays alike. Special Saver will conserve a significant amount of the special gauge after being splatted by an opponent, so Bomb Rush can be used more often.",
    "The Swim Speed Up ability allows players to swim faster, which makes harder target to kill and much more mobility when moving in squid form.",
    "The Splash-o-matic is a short-ranged, rapid firing weapon with the best accuracy among all shooters, excluding Blasters and Semi-Automatic weapons. It also has the lowest special gauge requirement for Inkjet, tied with the Octobrush, the Herobrush Replica, and the Custom Goo Tuber, allowing it to farm Inkjet very quickly.",
    "The traits of the Splash-o-matic make it a slayer's weapon:",
    "- Its near-perfect accuracy and high rate of fire make it very efficient at splatting opponents within its range.\nIts shots never deviate from the inner reticle — even while airborne. This gives its user the option to fire at opponents while jumping without sacrificing accuracy, aiding them as they close in on longer-ranged opponents.",
    "- Its lightweight nature makes it very mobile, even more so than its incarnation in Splatoon, allowing its user to more effectively flank their opponents.",
    "- The rapid firing rate and excellent ink coverage of the Splash-o-matic make it an excellent turfing weapon, allowing it to more easily maintain map control, capture Splat Zones, and build up its special gauge to farm Inkjet.",
    "- The primary weaknesses of the Splash-o-matic is its lack of both damage (28 HP per shot) and range (110.03 DU[3], particularly compared to the Tentatek Splattershot (35 HP per shot, 116.99 DU[3]). This problem can be solved by jumping, slightly increasing your range.\nMain Power Up can increase the damage of the Splash-o-matic up to 33.3 HP but will require a substantial amount of ability points (see below).\nTo offset the lack of range, refrain from engaging most opponents head-on and rely more on flanking and sharking to sneak up close to your opponents.",
    "While Toxic Mist cannot damage opponents, it can limit their ability to advance, attack, or flee:",
    "- Throwing Toxic Mist in front of the opponents' positions can either slow their offensive rush or prevent them from quickly reacting on defense. However, beware of any opponents' bombs thrown into or through the Mist.",
    "- Ink-guzzling weapons, such as chargers, splatlings, sloshers, and most blasters, are most affected by its ink tank-draining effects.",
    "- Throwing Toxic Mist onto areas frequented by opponents, such as their snipe or the Tower, can dissuade them from remaining there.",
    "- Dropping a Toxic Mist behind while fleeing an unfavorable situation can buy precious time to escape.",
    "- Opponents wielding heavyweight weapons – including the Explosher, the Tenta Brella, and especially the Rainmaker – are extremely vulnerable to attack if caught in Toxic Mist. Note that the Rainmaker does not depend on its wielder's ink tank and can still fire shots while within a Toxic Mist.",
    "- Starting from version 4.2.0, opposing dualie wielders will have to spend 3.5 times the usual amount of ink to perform a dodge roll, reducing their ability to strafe, rush forward, or zone out targets.",
    "- As of version 5.2.0 onwards, Toxic Mist can also slow opponents using a Baller, preventing them from taking over space for their teammates.",
    "The Splash-o-matic's rapid turfing and low special gauge requirement allows it to farm and spam Inkjet more often than almost all other weapon kits with Inkjet. However, proper piloting is still required to take full advantage of this ability:",
    "- Upon activation, its launching point is marked for all players – teammates and opponents – to see and, as of version 3.2.0, also indicates when its user will return via super jump, allowing an opponent to camp or shark there. Therefore, it is advised to launch the Inkjet from a less visible and better-protected area.\nDrop Roller allows its user to better dodge either a potential Inkjet punish or a simple super jump punish, providing a safer landing.\nWhile the Splash-o-matic does not have a lethal bomb to drop onto an awaiting opponent upon landing, dropping a Toxic Mist after the special ends might permit a teammate to get a revenge splat.",
    "- Its movement speed is determined by both the Splash-o-matic's strafing speed and the number of Run Speed Up ability points equipped.",
    "- It is also possible to morph into squid/octopus form and swim (in friendly ink) while the special is active. This provides some key benefits:\nMorphing will halt the jets to enable the pilot to descend, making them a less predictable target.\nSwimming is faster than flying, enabling an Inkjet pilot to activate the special at a farther distance from opponents and more quickly pursue them.",
    "- Its altitude depends on the elevation of the surface it is hovering above, enabling it to either fly very high over an elevated structure, such as the glass roof in Shellendorf Institute, or hover high enough to challenge an opponent on a perch.\nHowever, the Inkjet cannot achieve thrust off of grates or mesh, causing its pilot to merely walk on them. Avoid hovering over them to maintain altitude.\nPressing the  button will provide a temporary extra thrust. Mastery of both boosting and descending (see above) is necessary for Inkjet pilots to become less predictable for long-ranged opponents to track and pick off.",
    "- Its mobility enables it to reach areas that are otherwise not easily accessible — or even inaccessible, such as over the glass enclosures in Kelp Dome.",
    "- The Inkjet's cannon fires long-ranged, Rainmaker-like bursts of ink that splat opponents in one direct hit or two to four indirect hits:\nLead the Inkjet's shots to compensate for their slightly slower travel speed, especially when positioned farther from an intended target.\nIts splash damage can splat opponents positioned behind obstacles, varying from 30 to 50 damage; the closer the shot to the opponent, the more damaging.",
    "- If an Inkjet falls out of bounds, such as into the water, its pilot will land back onto the location of launch — or the most previous point of solid ground. Therefore, the Inkjet can save a player from an out-of-bounds splat in a pinch. You can also use this to your advantage. When being pressured by the enemy team, going into the water can save you from being splatted.",
    "The Splash-o-matic has two drawbacks that have to be compensated for by the other three weapons of its team composition: short range and lack of lethal bombs.[4]",
    "- The other three weapons need to be longer-ranged, as having too many short-ranged weapons on a team without a longer-ranged weapon to provide support fire allows opposing slayers to play more aggressively and an opposing anchor to position themselves farther forward.",
    "- At least one of the Splash-o-matic user's teammates should have lethal bombs, as a team with no lethal bombs will not be able to sufficiently zone out its opponents.",
    "The Splash-o-matic's rapid turfing and farmable Inkjet means that a fellow slayer does not necessarily need to turf or build up their specials as often, freeing them to use other complementary weapons:",
    "- Weapons that trade turfing for range, such as the Splattershot Pro or medium- to long-ranged blasters, can complement a Splash-o-matic very well.",
    "- Users of slayer's weapons with high special gauge requirements, such as the Kensa Splattershot Pro or the Soda Slosher (both 210p), can rely more on their main and sub weapons, knowing that their Splash-o-matic teammate can provide constant Inkjet support.",
    "Like other weapon kits with Inkjet, the Splash-o-matic greatly benefits from a teammate's Ink Armor:",
    "- Because an Ink Armored player can withstand more damage — especially from an opponent's charger, an armored Inkjet pilot can fly more aggressively.",
    "- Sometimes, it can pay to wait a little longer for a teammate to build up and activate Ink Armor before activating Inkjet. However, do not hesitate to use your special weapon whenever it is needed during a battle, such as when making a push, protecting a lead, or distracting an opposing anchor.",
    "- While the Splattershot Jr. can farm Ink Armor as quickly as the Splash-o-matic can farm Inkjet, the short range of both weapons can put them at a disadvantage against longer-ranged opponents. The N-ZAP '85 is a viable, slightly longer-ranged alternative.",
    "- Having shorter range and weaker damage than most other typical slayer's weapons, the Splash-o-matic would be at a disadvantage against them:\nAll variants of the Splattershot, the L-3 Nozzlenose, and the Splattershot Pro outrange the Splash-o-matic. Most sloshers and some blasters also have longer range than the Splash-o-matic.\nRollers and most blasters overpower the Splash-o-matic. However, they each require its user to get get within range and land their shots.\nWhile the Splash-o-matic lacks a damaging sub weapon, such as bombs, Toxic Mist can make assaulting an opposing Splash-o-matic user tricky. Avoid pursuing an opposing Splash-o-matic user in a confined area to reduce the chance of getting hit with Toxic Mist.",
    "- Any mid-ranged or long-ranged weapon, such as chargers and splatlings, can fire upon the Splash-o-matic with impunity unless it gets too close. Long-ranged weapons can also punish a predictable Inkjet pilot.",
    "- A competent Splash-o-matic user will likely attack its longer-ranged opponents through either flanking or sharking:\nKeep track of all four members of the opposing team – which ones are present, which ones are splatted, and which ones are back at their spawn point.\nCheck the map periodically for opposing ink forming around flanks to anticipate a flanking attack.\nTo prevent sharking, check suspicious puddles of the opponents' ink, preferably with a thrown sub weapon.\nWeapons that track opponents, such as Point Sensors, temporarily prevent an opponent from sharking and makes them an easier target for long-ranged teammates to pick off.",
    "- If an opposing Splash-o-matic user uses Toxic Mist to restrict your team's movement, consider throwing bombs either into or beyond the Mist to prevent them from traveling through it.",
    "- Dogfights between opposing Inkjets are generally decided by each pilot's skill, positioning, and any teammates present.",
    "- To punish an opposing Inkjet after it lands, eliminate its pilot's teammates while avoiding both its shots and exhaust before punishing the landing, preferably with a well-placed, well-timed bomb followed by shots from the main weapon. Make sure the opposing pilot does not have Drop Roll, however.",
    "As a short-ranged slayer's weapon, the Splash-o-matic requires its user to be in close quarters with the opponent, who might be inclined to use bombs for zoning out the Splash-o-matic user. Ever since its introduction in version 4.3.0, Bomb Defense Up DX will not only reduce the damage taken from opposing sub and special weapons that are not one-hit-splat but will also reduce the duration of the tracking effects of certain opponent's sub and special weapons, such as Point Sensors and Ink Mines, allowing the user of this ability to evade detection more easily.",
    "Any good user of a short-ranged weapon like the Splash-o-matic is expected to come in contact with the opponent's ink on various surfaces, which can both be damaging and reduce mobility. Ink Resistance Up not only partially offsets the reduction in mobility but also delays the damage taken from contact with opposing ink.",
    "With a base damage of just 28 HP per shot, the Splash-o-matic is one of the weakest slayer's weapons in Splatoon 2. Fortunately, it is also one of the few weapons whose damage can be increased with Main Power Up, increasing its effectiveness as a slayer's weapon.",
    "- 31 ability points – achievable with either one main and seven subs or two mains and four subs – are enough to reach the Splash-o-matic's damage cap of 33.3 HP. 30 ability points – three mains – increase the Splash-o-matic's damage output to 33.2 HP.[5]",
    "- For a smaller but nearly-effective investment, 21 ability points – reached with seven subs, one main and four subs, or two mains and one sub – are enough to exceed 32 HP of damage, while 15 ability points – either five subs or one main and two subs – will exceed 30 HP.[5]",
    "Ninja Squid reduces detection by opponents while swimming on non-vertical surfaces. It allows its user to swim at full speed undetected at the cost of about 20% of the maximum swimming speed as of version 3.0.0. Because a Splash-o-matic user has difficulty attacking most opponents head-on, Ninja Squid can make it easier for its user to shark and more safely approach opponents.",
    "- As of version 3.0.0, Ninja Squid reduces the maximum swim speed of the Splash-o-matic from 2.02 DU/f to 1.81 DU/f.[5]",
    "Quick Respawn shortens respawn time after getting splatted (under specific conditions), encouraging a Splash-o-matic user to remain aggressive even after getting splatted.",
    "- 16 ability points – two mains and two subs – are enough to reduce the respawn time from 8.5 seconds to 6.67 seconds.[5]",
    "Super Jumping to a teammate after respawning carries the risk of getting splatted upon landing, due to the appearance of a Super Jump indicator. When equipped, Stealth Jump better covers this indicator from long distance opponents, allowing its user to more safely return to the front lines and maintain pressure on the opponent.",
    "As a short-ranged weapon that excels at flanking, the Splash-o-matic greatly benefits if it is able to swim faster. Swim Speed Up enables its user to more quickly close the distance towards an opponent, more quickly respond to an opponents' push, or even escape unfavorable situations.",
    "- 16 ability points – one main and two subs – increase the swim speed from 2.02 DU/f to 2.19 DU/f.[5]",
    "- Swim Speed Up can reduce the swim speed penalty from Ninja Squid. However, it takes at least 28 ability points – either one main and six subs or about two mains and three subs – of Swim Speed Up for a Splash-o-matic user to fully offset the swimming speed penalty of Ninja Squid.[5]",
    "- Therefore, a Splash-o-matic user with Ninja Squid will have to decide between either having fewer ability points available for other abilities or swimming at less than the base maximum speed. For example, just 13 ability points – one main and one sub – are enough to restore the swim speed of a Splash-o-matic user with Ninja Squid to 1.92 DU/f.[5]",
    "[6]",
    "The instant explosion and good ink efficiency of Burst Bombs offer a Splash-o-matic user plenty of uses:",
    "- Their quick damage makes them suitable for leading off attacks or finishing off injured opponents who attempt to flee. The Splash-o-matic can perform a quick combo with Burst Bombs, shortening its splatting time.",
    "- They effectively extend the range at which their user can quickly damage their opponents, allowing a Splash-o-matic user to poke at opponents from a safer distance. This is particularly useful for assisting teammates who are in fights by chipping in some damage from far away.",
    "- They instantly turf inkable surfaces, permitting either a fast pursuit of an opponent or a rapid retreat from an unfavorable situation.",
    "- They also restrict your opponents' mobility and reduce their sharking opportunities, making Burst Bombs particularly effective against opponents whose weapons depend on map control to be effective – most rollers, Squiffers, and Nautiluses.[7][8] Also, any opponents hit by Burst Bombs will be surrounded by your team's ink, further limiting their health and mobility.",
    "A Crab Tank, when used properly, can stop a push, or help a team push forward:",
    "- Crab Tank is best used in common backline positions, as it has poor mobility and struggles to deal with close range opponents, but has incredible power at range. However, players should ensure that they don't use it too far away from opponents, as its sluggishness makes it difficult for the special to reposition effectively.",
    "- Crab Tank has two modes of fire that each give the user versatility against opponents:\nIts primary fire mode initially shoots slowly, but ramps up in speed the longer the user continues to fire. It can struggle to deal consistent damage against opponents when firing slowly, but becomes very suppressive when firing quickly. It also deals incredible damage once it reaches its maximum fire rate, making it great at dealing with objects that have lots of HP such as Big Bubbler or the Booyah Bomb's armor.\nThe secondary fire mode shoots balls of ink that pierce opponents and explode on surfaces, similar to the Explosher. It is very effective at dealing with opponents hiding behind walls, as the explosion radius is massive. Players can also deal 90 damage if they hit opponents with the pierce of the ball and the explosion, which sets up for an easy combo with either the primary fire or another cannon shot. It is generally far easier to hit 90 damage combos on opponents that are below the user. While it resets the fire rate of the primary fire, the user can still use the primary fire between cannon shots.",
    "- Effective usage of each firing mode is very important. It is wise to always use the primary fire to allow it to ramp up in firing speed, but the secondary fire should not be neglected, as it effectively deals with opponents behind cover and can allow for quick damage against opponents when the primary fire is not at max power.",
    "- The range of all modes is close to that of the E-liter 4K allowing the user to threaten large amounts of area with its range.",
    "- Moving sideways is faster than moving forward with the Crab Tank. If needed to move, move more diagonally or sideways to advance quicker.",
    "- If ambushed from behind, the Crab Tank can use its ball form to either tank damage or heal itself. This will reset the fire rate of the normal fire mode, however.",
    "- The Crab Tank has minor endlag when it ends, either through being destroyed or running out of time. However, the user can still enter swim form during this time, so if an opponent approaches, it is good to enter swim form and move around before counterattacking.",
    "The Splash-o-matic is a very versatile weapon and can easily fill multiple slots in a team composition. While players would usually have to consider many things when building teams such as weapon ranges, lethal bombs, turfing capabilities, and so on, the Splash-o-matic is not a jack of all trades, but rather a master of all trades.",
    "Normally, having too many short-ranged weapons on a team would be a detriment for the following reasons:[9]",
    "- An opponent with a long-ranged weapon can more aggressively position themselves to zone out the entire shorter-ranged team.",
    "- The opposing slayers can play more aggressively, knowing that there is no long-ranged threat to pick them off from afar.",
    "However, the Crab Tank on the Splash-o-matic effectively turns the user into a long-ranged weapon and can apply strong pressure on the opposing team.",
    "Burst Bombs are not lethal bombs, but their effectiveness increases with higher numbers,[10] comboing with each other, the main weapon, and Crab Tank explosives. They also allow for long-range poking the weapon couldn't do otherwise without its sub. Weapons that can take advantage of the instant splash damage such as other Splash-o-matics or a Sloshing Machine pair well with Burst Bombs.",
    "Crab Tank also allows the Splash-o-matic to synergize with itself on a team composition,[11] and using multiple Crab Tanks is not an uncommon strategy. The special keeps the user alive while the other Splash-o-matics can get their own Crab Tanks, while also having Burst Bombs to combo with the current active Crab Tank. It is possible to chain Crab Tanks one after the other to apply pressure for an extended period of time on the opposing team. However, keep in mind that Crab Tank is a fairly static special and its effectiveness can vary on modes such as Tower Control and Rainmaker.[12]",
    "Much of the Splash-o-matic's hangups return from the previous games",
    "- Having shorter range and weaker damage than most other typical slayer's weapons, the Splash-o-matic would be at a disadvantage against them:\nAll variants of the Splattershot, the L-3 Nozzlenose, and the Splattershot Pro outrange the Splash-o-matic. Most sloshers and some blasters also have longer range than the Splash-o-matic.\nRollers and most blasters overpower the Splash-o-matic. However, they each require its user to get get within range and land their shots.",
    "- Any mid-ranged or long-ranged weapon, such as chargers and splatlings, can fire upon the Splash-o-matic with impunity unless it gets too close or uses its Crab Tank, though it is possible for longer-ranged weapons to splat the Crab Tank's rider if they use it on lower ground.",
    "- A competent Splash-o-matic user without its special will likely attack its longer-ranged opponents through either flanking or sharking:\nKeep track of all four members of the opposing team – which ones are present, which ones are splatted, and which ones are back at their spawn point.\nCheck the map periodically for opposing ink forming around flanks to anticipate a flanking attack.\nTo prevent sharking, check suspicious puddles of the opponents' ink, preferably with a thrown sub weapon.\nWeapons that track opponents, such as Point Sensors, temporarily prevent an opponent from sharking and makes them an easier target for long-ranged teammates to pick off.",
    "While very strong, there are ways to deal with a Crab Tank user:",
    "- Some weapons, most notably the Splatana Stamper and the Nautilus 47 can break a Crab Tank from a reasonable distance without putting themselves in too much danger. Higher DPS weapons can focus on destroying a Crab Tank when popped.",
    "- Whenever a Crab Tank user is shooting, the opponent will be vulnerable from the back.\nChargers, such as the E-liter 4K can splat the opponent from its range without too much risk.\nOther shorter ranged chargers cannot do this as the user will be in full view of the Crab Tank user.\nShorter ranged weapons can sneak behind the Crab Tank and splat them or stall them out, although be careful of any opponents.",
    "- A Crab Tank user cannot quickly turn to their sides to deal with opponents on their sides or behind them. If confronting a Crab Tank user, be more on the sides or behind them.",
    "- Throwing bombs at the Crab Tank can deal quick amounts of damage to the Crab Tank, which can help break a Crab Tank faster.\nIf thrown right, the bomb might even detonate and splat the Crab Tank user caught in the blast, or even any opponents nearby.",
    "- Specials such as Booyah Bomb or Triple Inkstrike can force a Crab Tank user to move or break the Crab Tank outright.",
    "- More aggresive specials, such as Reefslider and Ultra Stamp can quickly destroy the special, however they will have to get close in order to do so, exposing themselves to the Splash-o-matic user.",
    "- While Tenta Missiles or Ink Storm will likely not splat a Crab Tank user, they will force them to have to use their ball form to stay alive, throwing off their aim and resetting their fire rate.",
    "Ninja Squid reduces detection by opponents while swimming on non-vertical surfaces. It allows its user to swim at full speed undetected at the cost of a reduced swim speed. Because a Splash-o-matic user has difficulty attacking most opponents head-on, Ninja Squid can make it easier for its user to shark and more safely approach opponents.",
    "Same as S2; Quick Respawn shortens respawn time after getting splatted (under specific conditions), encouraging a Splash-o-matic user to remain aggressive even after getting splatted.",
    "Allows the Splash to get back into the action more quickly, provided there is a safe place to jump. Also can help the Splash-o-matic escape in a tight spot.",
    "While already mobile due to being a lightweight weapon, Swim Speed Up massively boosts the Splash's mobility, and helps counteract the negative effects of Ninja Squid.",
    "Due to the incredible power of the Crab Tank, as well as its important role in turning the Splash-o-matic into a long ranged threat, having one ready as often as possible is generally advisable.",
    "Similar to Special Charge Up, this ability makes it easier to have a Crab Tank ready as often as possible. This ability is more suited to aggressive playstyles, as it is more effective if the user gets splatted frequently.",
    "Throwing a lot of Burst Bombs can use up a lot of ink, so this ability enables the user to use them more frequently.",
    "This ability allows the Splash to throw Burst Bombs at opponents further away. It is particularly useful for supportive playstyles, as it can help out teammates in far away fights.",
    "The Splash-o-matic was assumed to be a strong weapon even before release,[13] and this prediction has held up very well. Following the release of 1.2.0, the Splash-o-matic has become more popular than before, with many teams running two Splash-o-matics in their team compositions.[14][15] This can be attributed to nerfs to the Sloshing Machine and Fizzy Bombs and improvements to the netcode, as well as its special; the Splash-o-matic is the best weapon with Crab Tank currently and can reliably get it due to good turfing, allowing it to pressure long-ranged threats for a considerably long period of time.",
    "This weapon has remained at the top of the meta since version 1.2.0 and throughout the entirety of Chill Season 2022, with only the Crab Tank receiving a slap on the wrist nerf that reduced its duration from 9 seconds to 8 seconds. This has not stopped the Splash-o-matic's dominance however, and double or even triple Splash-o-matic is a popular team composition at high level competitive due to the weapon's sheer flexibility.",
    "Version 3.0.0 added some counters to Crab Tank in the form of increased damage by the Trizooka, Ultra Stamp, and Inkjet against a Crab Tank, allowing the specials to quickly destroy it in a few hits. In addition, the Kraken Royale was added, which is fully invincible and does not take as much knockback against a Crab Tank's stream of shots when charging its dash attack, negates all knockback while dashing, and can destroy a Crab Tank in a few hits and even splat the rider. However, despite all of this, double Splash-o-matic is still a common team composition at the top level. For example, the Splatoon 3 North American Championship 2023 at PAX East 2023 had every team using double Splash-o-matic in nearly every match.[16]",
    "Many players have expressed how tired they are of the current meta, which has been ongoing for roughly six months, and Nintendo's refusal to nerf Crab Tank or Splash-o-matic in a meaningful way. Weapon bans or restrictions have been debated amongst the competitive community.[17][18]",
    "While Kraken Royale did not end up being the Crab Tank counter players were looking for, the competitive community rejoiced for version 3.1.0, which finally gave Crab Tank the nerfs the game needed. It added delay for attacking after exiting ball form as well as some endlag after the special ended, making the special more punishable upon breaking it. Forcing it to enter ball form was also valuable due to the added delay before the Crab Tank user could attack again, allowing players to potentially kill the user or get away safely. In addition, Burst Bombs were nerfed to have higher ink consumption.",
    "However, Splash-o-matic still remains one of the best weapons in the game, and a large part of it is once again the Crab Tank. Currently there are not many options for Crab Tank weapons, with only the Splash-o-matic and the Splat Dualies seeing competitive use, and the Splash-o-matic is often preferred due to its flexibility; the Splat Dualies are pure slayers and does not play around its Crab Tank as much.",
    "Double Splash-o-matic is still a strong option for team compositions; the recent InkTV Resurgence League often featured double Splash-o-matic teams. Having two Crab Tanks is a solid option for taking away enemy resources, as they will use specials to destroy one Crab Tank but ultimately have no more for the second one. In addition, Crab Tank is one of the best specials in the game for getting the user's team in, which is important when the stages in Splatoon 3 are linear in design with few flanking opportunities."
