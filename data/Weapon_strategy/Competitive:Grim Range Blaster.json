While the Burst Bombs are more versatile for combos and mobility, Killer Wail is much more situational than the Kraken, making the Custom variant more popular. It still holds solid niches on certain maps, similar to how the .52 Gal does.[1]\n\nKiller Wail is a versatile special that the user will often have due to its cheap cost of 160p, helping a Grim Range Blaster user, who cannot turf well.\n\n- Activate Killer Wail in a safe position. Once activated, the player will walk very slowly and cannot use their main weapon, making them easy targets for opponents.\n\n- Once launched, the Killer Wail will send out a laser that will splat any opponents that are in the laser.\n\n- Killer Wail is best used on narrow corridors as opponents will have little room to move away from.\n\n- Killer Wail can help in stopping Rainmaker and Tower Control pushes as opponents will be forced to stay away from the specific area.\n\n- Opponents under the effect of Bubbler or Kraken will be knocked back severely if touching Killer Wail, which can be a good counter to those specials.\n\n- Defense Up can reduce the damage from both Burst Bombs and the Grim Range Blaster, which can allow a user to survive against the combo. More Defense Up may be needed by the amount of Damage Up a Grim Range Blaster user has.\n\n- Bubbler and Kraken can be used in a pinch to survive against the Grim Range Blaster. Because of the weapon's slow fire rate, the user cannot knockback the user, forcing them to retreat.\n\n- If an opponent activates Killer Wail in an unsafe position, try attacking them as they are very vulnerable and cannot fight back.\n\n- The Killer Wail's laser can be briefly seen before it activates. Make sure to move out of the laser to avoid getting splatted.\n\nGear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.\n\nDamage Up will improve the consistency of the Grim Range Blaster's Burst Bomb combos, helping it fight better in battle.\n\nQuick Respawn will always shorten respawn time after getting splatted in this game, encouraging a Grim Range Blaster user to remain aggressive even after getting splatted and is in general useful for brute forcing your way back into the stage.[1]\n\n- One main, or 10 ability points, reduces the respawn time from 8.5 seconds to 7.29 seconds.[2]\n\n- Two mains, or 20 ability points, drops this further to 6.29 seconds.[2]\n\nSuper Jumping to a teammate after respawning carries the risk of getting splatted upon landing, due to the appearance of a Super Jump indicator. When equipped, Stealth Jump hides this marker completely at the cost of a slower Super Jump both in startup and the jump itself. This pairs well with Quick Respawn.\n\nThe Grim Range Blaster, like its Vanilla and Custom variants, is a medium-ranged blaster with good zoning and high splatting potential, and its overall kit complements the main weapon even better than those of the other variants. However, like the other variants, its slow firing rate, poor turfing, and high dependence on landing splats means that it will be at a big disadvantage if its user's team ever loses map control.\n\nThe Grim Range Blaster in Splatoon 2 has been nerfed compared to Splatoon's Grim Range Blaster.\n\n- The ink efficiency of the weapon has been reduced.\nA single shot will consume 11% of the ink tank, allowing users to shoot 9 times before needing to refill, whereas in Splatoon, a shot consumed 10% of the ink tank, allowing users to shoot 10 times before needing to refill.\nAfter firing, it takes 70 frames for the user to begin refilling their ink tank compared to the first game's 50 frames.\n\n- A single shot will consume 11% of the ink tank, allowing users to shoot 9 times before needing to refill, whereas in Splatoon, a shot consumed 10% of the ink tank, allowing users to shoot 10 times before needing to refill.\n\n- After firing, it takes 70 frames for the user to begin refilling their ink tank compared to the first game's 50 frames.\n\n- Splash damage deals 70 damage instead of Splatoon's 80.\n\n- The weapon's accuracy has been severely nerfed. In the first game, it took 60 frames to regain accuracy after jumping. This has been increased to 70 frames in Splatoon 2. The angle of shot deviation has also been increased from 0 degrees to 8 degrees.\n\n- A single shot will consume 11% of the ink tank, allowing users to shoot 9 times before needing to refill, whereas in Splatoon, a shot consumed 10% of the ink tank, allowing users to shoot 10 times before needing to refill.\n\n- After firing, it takes 70 frames for the user to begin refilling their ink tank compared to the first game's 50 frames.\n\nThe Grim Range Blaster can flex between the slayer and support roles:\n\n- Its direct hit range of 145 DU easily exceeds that of short-ranged weapons, such as the Kensa Splattershot (116.99 DU),[6] and barely exceeds that of a few medium-ranged ones, such as the L-3 Nozzlenose (141.36 DU).[6]\nFactoring in its near and far damage radii of 10 DU and 35 DU gives it splash damage ranges of 155 DU and 180 DU, both which are comparable to the ranges of other medium-ranged weapons, such as the H-3 Nozzlenose (160.396 DU),[6] enabling the Grim Range Blaster to zone out certain opponents.\n\n- Factoring in its near and far damage radii of 10 DU and 35 DU gives it splash damage ranges of 155 DU and 180 DU, both which are comparable to the ranges of other medium-ranged weapons, such as the H-3 Nozzlenose (160.396 DU),[6] enabling the Grim Range Blaster to zone out certain opponents.\n\n- Its shots travel slower than those of rapid-firing weapons — 10.8 units per frame versus 23 units per frame for the Dualie Squelchers, for example. This means that a Grim Range Blaster user has to lead their shots in order to be accurate.\n\n- The Grim Range Blaster becomes less accurate (by 8 degrees) immediately after jumping.\nWaiting 25 frames – during the descent of a jump – will allow the outer reticle to shrink back and the accuracy to improve for up to 70 more frames.[7]\nMain Power Up reduces the shot deviation during a jump by up to 37.5%.\n\n- Waiting 25 frames – during the descent of a jump – will allow the outer reticle to shrink back and the accuracy to improve for up to 70 more frames.[7]\n\n- Main Power Up reduces the shot deviation during a jump by up to 37.5%.\n\n- The Grim Range Blaster's damage – arguably its greatest asset – widely varies depending on whether a target is hit directly, and if not, how close to the shot's explosion the target is and whether the shot exploded on a solid surface:\n125 health points (HP) of damage per direct hit — enough to splat most opponents in one hit\n50-70 HP per hit of splash damage if the shot's explosion does not hit a solid surface\n25-35 HP per hit of splash damage if the shot's explosion hits a solid surface\nThus, when firing up a ledge or around either an obstacle or an opponent's brella shield for splash damage, avoid hitting solid surfaces to maximize damage.\n\n- 125 health points (HP) of damage per direct hit — enough to splat most opponents in one hit\n\n- 50-70 HP per hit of splash damage if the shot's explosion does not hit a solid surface\n\n- 25-35 HP per hit of splash damage if the shot's explosion hits a solid surface\n\n- Thus, when firing up a ledge or around either an obstacle or an opponent's brella shield for splash damage, avoid hitting solid surfaces to maximize damage.\n\n- The Grim Range Blaster suffers a longer lag time after each shot compared to rapid-firing weapons, making it easily punishable after a miss:\nThe interval between firing and either morphing or using a sub weapon is 30 frames — far longer than the 4 frames of the Splattershot Pro.\nIts firing rate is 60 frames between shots (1 shot per second) – far slower than the Splattershot Pro's 8 frames between shots (7.5 shots per second)\nTherefore, unless attacking an opponent up a ledge or around either an obstacle or their brella shield, always go for direct hits.\n\n- The interval between firing and either morphing or using a sub weapon is 30 frames — far longer than the 4 frames of the Splattershot Pro.\n\n- Its firing rate is 60 frames between shots (1 shot per second) – far slower than the Splattershot Pro's 8 frames between shots (7.5 shots per second)\n\n- Therefore, unless attacking an opponent up a ledge or around either an obstacle or their brella shield, always go for direct hits.\n\n- Besides its long lag after each shot, the Grim Range Blaster suffers from other drawbacks:\nIts movement speed while firing (0.4 units per frame) is slow compared to most weapons of comparable range. Combined with the long lag after shots, the Grim Range Blaster is rather immobile and vulnerable to attack after each shot, so shots must be fired judiciously.\nIts poor ink efficiency and turfing make it prone to getting surrounded by opposing ink if fired recklessly. Avoid overextending into the opponents' territory.\nBurst Bombs and Swim Speed Up can help address some of the mobility issues, while Ink Resistance Up reduces the loss of running speed in opposing ink.\n\n- Its movement speed while firing (0.4 units per frame) is slow compared to most weapons of comparable range.

While not quite as devastating as back in Splatoon, the Burst Bomb-Grim Range Blaster combo can still be used to confirm splats.\n\n- They instantly turf inkable surfaces, permitting either a fast pursuit of an opponent or a rapid retreat from an unfavorable situation. This trait is particularly important for the slow firing, poor turfing Grim Range Blaster, providing its user mobility that it would otherwise not have.\n\n- Opponents hit by Burst Bombs will be surrounded by your team's ink, further limitng their health and mobility.\n\n- Direct hits will inflict 60 HP of damage, while splash damage will only deliver 25-35 HP. Always go for direct hits whenever possible.\n\n- Although less powerful than other bombs, a Burst Bomb can still damage or even destroy an opponent's brella shield, Splash Wall, or Baller or the Rainmaker shield, while detonating on contact.\nAny opponents caught within the Burst Bomb's explosion will get damaged or splatted.[9]\nIt will also inflate or pop a teammate's bubbles but deflate or diffuse an opponent's bubbles, while still detonating on contact.[10]\n\n- Any opponents caught within the Burst Bomb's explosion will get damaged or splatted.[9]\n\n- It will also inflate or pop a teammate's bubbles but deflate or diffuse an opponent's bubbles, while still detonating on contact.[10]\n\n- An opponent's Splashdown or Booyah Bomb will defuse any Burst Bombs it comes in contact with, so hold off throwing them until after the special weapon finishes.\n\n- Any opponents caught within the Burst Bomb's explosion will get damaged or splatted.[9]\n\n- It will also inflate or pop a teammate's bubbles but deflate or diffuse an opponent's bubbles, while still detonating on contact.[10]\n\nTenta Missiles can be used to locate and pressure opponents and force them out of position without having to commit too far forward:\n\n- It is recommended to only activate the Tenta Missiles at a safe distance from opponents, not only because a Tenta Missile user is vulnerable to close-range attacks but also because opponents who are further back are easier to track and home missiles on.\n\n- Sometimes, it may be more beneficial to target a specific opponent or two instead of all of them, based on their weapons, location, and situation:[11]\nOpponents wielding heavy, slow firing weapons will have a harder time escaping the missiles.\nOpponents who are bunched together are more likely to cause their teammates to receive collateral damage than those who are spread apart.\nTenta Missiles are also a reliable means of forcing opposing anchors to cede their ground and lose focus while aiming.[12] Sometimes, this is the only reliable means to push back into a zone or another important area of the stage.\nTenta Missiles can counter an opponent's Sting Ray or Booyah Bomb if anticipated early enough; an opponent will be forced to either delay or interrupt it to avoid getting splatted by the missiles, throwing off their aim.[13]\n\n- Opponents wielding heavy, slow firing weapons will have a harder time escaping the missiles.\n\n- Opponents who are bunched together are more likely to cause their teammates to receive collateral damage than those who are spread apart.\n\n- Tenta Missiles are also a reliable means of forcing opposing anchors to cede their ground and lose focus while aiming.[12] Sometimes, this is the only reliable means to push back into a zone or another important area of the stage.\n\n- Tenta Missiles can counter an opponent's Sting Ray or Booyah Bomb if anticipated early enough; an opponent will be forced to either delay or interrupt it to avoid getting splatted by the missiles, throwing off their aim.[13]\n\n- Opponents wielding heavy, slow firing weapons will have a harder time escaping the missiles.\n\n- Opponents who are bunched together are more likely to cause their teammates to receive collateral damage than those who are spread apart.\n\n- Tenta Missiles are also a reliable means of forcing opposing anchors to cede their ground and lose focus while aiming.[12] Sometimes, this is the only reliable means to push back into a zone or another important area of the stage.\n\n- Tenta Missiles can counter an opponent's Sting Ray or Booyah Bomb if anticipated early enough; an opponent will be forced to either delay or interrupt it to avoid getting splatted by the missiles, throwing off their aim.[13]\n\nBecause blasters are generally poor at turfing, their users will have to rely on their teammates to maintain map control. Not having enough turfing ability – usually from having too many blasters and chargers – presents its own set of problems:[14]\n\n- A team whose composition lacks enough turfing ability can be rendered immobile if the other team dominates map control.\n\n- A lack of turfing also makes it difficult to alter the course of a game, even after wiping out the other team.\n\nWhile the Grim Range Blaster's Burst Bombs are invaluable for mobility and confirming splats, they lack certain advantages offered by lethal bombs — particularly either Splat or Suction Bombs, which provide their user's team a couple advantages over another team that has no lethal bombs in its composition:[14]\n\n- Their one-hit-splat offers its user's team chances of instantly gaining a numbers advantage, from which a game-winning push can arise.\n\n- Their lethal explosion provides space for its user's team to either push into an area held by the opponent or stall an opponent's push.\n\nTo address these first two issues, a Grim Range Blaster user is best accompanied with a teammate whose weapon has both efficient turfing and lethal bombs, such as the Splattershot Jr. or the N-ZAP '85. This ensures that the Grim Range Blaster user will have lethal bomb support and turf to retreat to whenever necessary.\n\nWhile having multiple players on the same team launching Tenta Missiles might seem like a fun and easy means to cause opponents to scramble for cover, having too many players equipped with them – no more than one or two – can reduce the effectiveness of a team composition:[14]\n\n- Other special weapons, such as Inkjet or Sting Ray, are intended for splatting opponents and more capable at this than are Tenta Missiles.\n\n- Tenta Missiles cannot reliably turf highly contested areas of the stage as well as certain other special weapons, such as Bomb Launcher or Ink Storm.\n\nCoordinating with your teammates can greatly increase the Tenta Missiles' effect during a battle:\n\n- Launching Tenta Missiles just before a push can cause opponents to scatter, giving your team opportunities to pick off any opponents caught fleeing the Missiles.\n\n- Firing Tenta Missiles on defense can help stall an opponent's push, but make sure that your teammates are nearby the front lines to follow the Missiles up.\n\n- Launching Tenta Missiles while a teammate is using a special designed to splat opponents, such as Sting Ray or Inkjet, can limit the opponents' escape options and even prevent them from Super Jumping to safety.\n\n- Bomb Defense Up DX reduces both direct hit and splash damage from Burst Bombs and splash damage from Tenta Missiles, improving its user's survivability against both the sub and special weapons of an opposing Grim Range Blaster user. With just three ability points, or one sub,…[15][16]\n…direct hit damage from Burst Bombs is reduced from 60 HP to 57.7 HP.\n…splash damage from Burst Bombs is reduced from 25-35 HP to 24-33.6 HP.\n…splash damage from Tenta Missiles is reduced from 50 HP to 48.3 HP[17]\n\n- …direct hit damage from Burst Bombs is reduced from 60 HP to 57.7 HP.\n\n- …splash damage from Burst Bombs is reduced from 25-35 HP to 24-33.6 HP.\n\n- …splash damage from Tenta Missiles is reduced from 50 HP to 48.3 HP[17]\n\n- To engage an opposing Grim Range Blaster user with a shorter range weapon, try to catch it off guard through either careful flanking or sharking, better positioning, or wise use of bombs. Do not forget that the Grim Range Blaster user also has Burst Bombs as their disposal.\n\n- Even weapons with ranges comparable to that of the Grim Range Blaster should rely on better mobility to get into its blind spot (the area where indirects cannot connect) as being inside the blind spot forces the user to either hit a direct or rely on burst bombs - which are not always accessible - to survive. Both variants of the Dualie Squelchers can easily rush into the Grim Range Blaster's blind spot but may struggle when fighting it outside of it.\n\n- The Splat Brella and Kensa Undercover Brella and their variants cannot sufficiently protect their users from the splash damage of the Grim Range Blaster, but can occasionally predict where a Grim Range Blaster will shoot to move in a way that makes the shot hit the shield instead of going around it and dealing indirect damage.\n\n- Whenever possible, exploit the Grim Range Blaster's poor ink efficiency and turfing by surrounding it with ink. Sub weapons and teammates can help accomplish this.\n\n- It is preferable to engage an opposing Grim Range Blaster in a more open area – where there is more room to outmaneuver it and surround it with ink – than in a closed area. If this is not possible, remain farther back on a ledge or further around a corner to avoid splash damage.\n\n- A long-ranged weapon, such as a charger or most splatlings, can attack an opposing Grim Range Blaster user from long distance with impunity. However, once the Grim Range Blaster user gets close enough, their one-shot-splat can spell the end for their slower firing opponent.\n\n- A competent Grim Range Blaster user is likely capable at both flanking and sharking:\nKeep track of all four members of the opposing team – which ones are present, which ones are splatted, and which ones are back at their spawn point.\nCheck the map periodically for opposing ink forming around flanks to anticipate a flanking attack.\nTo prevent sharking, check suspicious puddles of the opponents' ink, preferably with a thrown sub weapon.\nWeapons that track opponents, such as Point Sensors, temporarily prevent an opponent from sharking and makes them an easier target for long-ranged teammates to pick off.\n\n- Keep track of all four members of the opposing team – which ones are present, which ones are splatted, and which ones are back at their spawn point.\n\n- Check the map periodically for opposing ink forming around flanks to anticipate a flanking attack.\n\n- To prevent sharking, check suspicious puddles of the opponents' ink, preferably with a thrown sub weapon.\n\n- Weapons that track opponents, such as Point Sensors, temporarily prevent an opponent from sharking and makes them an easier target for long-ranged teammates to pick off.\n\n- When pursued by a Grim Range Blaster, using almost any sub weapon (except for Squid Beakons) can either delay their pursuit or deter them from chasing.\n\n- Be mindful of both when the opponent has Tenta Missiles ready and when the missiles are launched:\nIf an opponent attempts to launch them when nearby you, splat them quickly to reduce or even cancel their deployment.\nWhen the opponent deploys their Tenta Missiles, avoid getting close to teammates - even when not targeted, as a targeted player crossing paths with a teammate might cause the other to get injured or splatted.\nWhenever targeted by opposing Tenta Missiles, unless actively engaging an opponent, only move enough to avoid damage and reduce the amount of turfing by the Missiles.[18]\n\n- If an opponent attempts to launch them when nearby you, splat them quickly to reduce or even cancel their deployment.\n\n- When the opponent deploys their Tenta Missiles, avoid getting close to teammates - even when not targeted, as a targeted player crossing paths with a teammate might cause the other to get injured or splatted.\n\n- Whenever targeted by opposing Tenta Missiles, unless actively engaging an opponent, only move enough to avoid damage and reduce the amount of turfing by the Missiles.[18]\n\n- …direct hit damage from Burst Bombs is reduced from 60 HP to 57.7 HP.\n\n- …splash damage from Burst Bombs is reduced from 25-35 HP to 24-33.6 HP.\n\n- …splash damage from Tenta Missiles is reduced from 50 HP to 48.3 HP[17]\n\n- Keep track of all four members of the opposing team – which ones are present, which ones are splatted, and which ones are back at their spawn point.\n\n- Check the map periodically for opposing ink forming around flanks to anticipate a flanking attack.\n\n- To prevent sharking, check suspicious puddles of the opponents' ink, preferably with a thrown sub weapon.\n\n- Weapons that track opponents, such as Point Sensors, temporarily prevent an opponent from sharking and makes them an easier target for long-ranged teammates to pick off.\n\n- If an opponent attempts to launch them when nearby you, splat them quickly to reduce or even cancel their deployment.\n\n- When the opponent deploys their Tenta Missiles, avoid getting close to teammates - even when not targeted, as a targeted player crossing paths with a teammate might cause the other to get injured or splatted.\n\n- Whenever targeted by opposing Tenta Missiles, unless actively engaging an opponent, only move enough to avoid damage and reduce the amount of turfing by the Missiles.[18]\n\nGear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.\n\nAs a heavy consumer of ink, the Grim Range Blaster can be fired more often if its user can refill their ink tank at a faster rate. A valuable utility ability for almost any weapon, Ink Recovery Up is invaluable for a Grim Range Blaster user.[15][16]\n\n- Six ability points, or two subs, decreases the time needed to fully refill an empty ink while submerged in friendly ink from 180 frames, or 3 seconds, to 169 frames, or 2.82 seconds, effectively increasing the refill rate from 33.33%/s (percent per second) to 35.46%/s.\n\n- Ten ability points, or one main, further decreases the time needed to fully refill the ink tank to 161 frames, or 2.68 seconds, effectively increasing the refill rate to 37.31%/s.[19]\n\nThe Grim Range Blaster uses a large portion of the ink tank per shot. Ink Saver (Main) not only allows it to fire more shots per ink tank but also conserves ink for Burst Bomb use.[15]\n\n- Six ability points, or two subs, of Ink Saver (Main) are enough to increase the number of shots fired with a full ink tank from barely over nine to just under ten.\n\n- Thirteen ability points, or one main and one sub, increases the number of shots fired with a full ink tank to barely under eleven.[19]\n\nInk Saver (Sub) allows more frequent use of Burst Bombs and conserves more ink for the main weapon. Because Burst Bombs play a large role for a Grim Range Blaster user, conserving ink per Burst Bomb use will be beneficial.[15]\n\n- Just four ability points – achievable with two subs – can reduce the ink consumption per Burst Bomb to 38.98%, which allows the use of two Burst Bombs and two shots from the main weapon.\n\n- Thirteen ability points, or one main and one sub, further reduces the ink consumption per Burst Bomb to 36.93%.\n\nQuick Respawn shortens respawn time after getting splatted (under specific conditions). Like other slayer's weapons, the Grim Range Blaster benefits from abilities that promote aggressive play, such as Quick Respawn.\n\n- One main, or 10 ability points, reduces the respawn time by 1.21 seconds.\n\n- Two mains, or 20 ability points, saves 2.21 seconds for respawning.[19]\n\nStealth Jump hides its user's Super Jump landing marker from opponents (and allies) who are not too close to it — about three tile lengths in the middle of Inkblot Art Academy.[20] This encourages its user to Super Jump back to the frontlines more often.\n\nBecause a Grim Range Blaster user has trouble turfing and is less mobile as a result, they can greatly benefit from Swim Speed Up, which enables its user to better maintain an optimal distance from an opponent, more quickly respond to an opponents' push, or even escape unfavorable situations.\n\n- 16 ability points – one main and two subs – increase the swim speed from 1.92 DU/f to 2.14 units per frame.[19]\n\n[21]"
