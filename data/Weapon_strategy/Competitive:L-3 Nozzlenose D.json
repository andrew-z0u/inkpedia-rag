  "content": "Gear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.\n\nDamage Up is an incredibly useful ability for an L-3 Nozzlenose D user to have as it will allow them to splat slightly damaged opponents with three hits rather than four.\n\n- 16 ability points, one main and two subs, will deal 32.99 damage per hit, dealing 99 damage per burst.\n\n- 18 ability points of Damage Up, or six subs, will reach the damage cap of 33.3HP per bullet.[1]\n\nIt is also worth noting that more Damage Up must be used in order to counter the effects of Defense Up.\n\n- 34 ability points or one main and eight subs of Damage Up is enough to meet the 33.3 damage threshold against opponents with 10 ability points (1 main) of Defense Up.[2]\n\nWith Ink Saver (Sub), users are able to throw Burst Bombs at a more frequent rate during combat. This is especially useful for an L-3 Nozzlenose D player, as the damage from Burst Bombs (direct or splash) will finish off an enemy they've already hit thrice.\n\n- A pure (one main and three subs) or 19 AP of Ink Saver Sub is enough to throw three burst bombs on a full tank. [3]\n\nSwim Speed Up can be proven to be quite useful to an L-3 Nozzlenose D user, allowing them to get to key areas of the map faster, flee dangerous situations quickly, and move faster while using their Kraken.\n\n- 6 ability points – two subs – of Swim Speed Up will increase the player's swim speed from 1.92 to 2.02 DU/f.\n\n- 10 ability points – or one main – will increase it further from 1.92 to 2.08 DU/f.\n\n- The L-3 Nozzlenose D is a unique, medium ranged slayer's weapon[6], thanks to its various abilities.\nIt has more range than a number of other slayer's weapons, such as the Splattershot, the Splat Dualies, and the Splash-o-matic, allowing it to zone out many opposing slayers in a one-on-one and both shark and turf from a safer distance.\nThe ink coverage of the L-3 Nozzlenose D and Burst Bombs is very efficient for turfing, which helps maintain map control and quickly build up the special gauge.\nIts mobility, particularly while firing, is amazing for a middleweight weapon, outpacing the Splattershot Pro, the Splattershot, even the Splash-o-matic. Run Speed Up can further increase this mobility, making its user a more difficult target to hit while firing.\nMain Power Up can increase its damage per shot, maxing out at 33.3 with 24 ability points - about two mains and one sub - as of version 5.1.0.\nComeback, Quick Respawn, and Stealth Jump are abilities that each encourage aggressive play for a slayer.\n\n- It has more range than a number of other slayer's weapons, such as the Splattershot, the Splat Dualies, and the Splash-o-matic, allowing it to zone out many opposing slayers in a one-on-one and both shark and turf from a safer distance.\n\n- The ink coverage of the L-3 Nozzlenose D and Burst Bombs is very efficient for turfing, which helps maintain map control and quickly build up the special gauge.\n\n- Its mobility, particularly while firing, is amazing for a middleweight weapon, outpacing the Splattershot Pro, the Splattershot, even the Splash-o-matic.

Therefore, it is advised to launch the Inkjet from a less visible and better protected area.\nDrop Roller allows its user to better dodge either a potential Inkjet punish or a simple super jump punish, providing a safer landing.\nSpecials are also free ink reloads, allowing the L-3 Nozzlenose D user to throw a Burst Bomb upon landing after the special ends.\nIts movement speed is determined by both the L-3 Nozzlenose D's strafing speed and the number of Run Speed Up ability points equipped.\nIts altitude depends on the elevation of the surface it is hovering above, enabling it to either fly very high over an elevated structure, such as the glass roof in Shellendorf Institute, or hover high enough to challenge an opponent on a perch.\nHowever, the Inkjet cannot achieve thrust off of grates or mesh, causing its pilot to merely walk on them. Avoid hovering over them to maintain altitude.\nPressing the  button will provide a temporary extra thrust, while morphing into squid/octopus form will halt the jets to enable the pilot to descend. Mastery of these maneuvers is necessary for Inkjet pilots to become less predictable for long-ranged opponents to track and pick off.\nIts mobility enables it to reach areas that are otherwise not easily accessible — or even inaccessible, such as over the glass enclosures in Kelp Dome.\nThe Inkjet's cannon fires long-ranged, Rainmaker-like bursts of ink that splat opponents in one direct hit or two to four indirect hits:\nLead the Inkjet's shots to compensate for their slightly slower travel speed, especially when positioned farther from an intended target.\nIts splash damage can splat opponents positioned behind obstacles, varying from 30 to 50 damage; the closer the shot to the opponent, the more damaging.\nIf an Inkjet falls out of bounds, such as into the water, its pilot will land back onto the location of launch — or the most previous point of solid ground. Therefore, the Inkjet can save a player from an out-of-bounds splat in a pinch.\n\n- Upon activation, its launching point is marked for all players – teammates and opponents – to see and, as of version 3.2.0, also indicates when its user will return via super jump, allowing an opponent to camp or shark there.

Careful flanking or sharking and better positioning and tactical use of bombs are more effective than brute force.\nThe Splattershot Pro easily outranges the L-3 Nozzlenose D but is outmaneuvered by it due to its relatively slow running speed while firing. Try to zone out the L-3 Nozzlenose D and watch both the ink tank and the surrounding turf because the Splattershot Pro is also weaker in both ink efficiency and turfing as well.\nMid- to long-ranged support weapons are often the best bet against the L-3 Nozzlenose D. The .96 Gal, the H-3 Nozzlenose, and the Dualie Squelchers all outrange the L-3 Nozzlenose D, and the latter also outmaneuvers it (through dodge rolling).\nBrellas can pose a problem for the L-3 Nozzlenose D due to the latter's lag between bursts, but beware the L-3 Nozzlenose D's mobility.\nBe wary of any Burst Bombs the opposing L-3 Nozzlenose D might use, as they provide its user another quick damaging option to rely on.\n\n- One-on-one matchups between L-3 Nozzlenose Ds on opposing teams are decided by the players' skill, positioning, turf control, and assistance from teammates.\n\n- The L-3 Nozzlenose D outranges and outmaneuvers many typical slayer's weapons, such as the Splattershot and the Splash-o-matic, so they would be at a disadvantage in a straight one-on-one.

This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.\n\nIncreases main weapon damage up to 33.3 per shot. The L-3 Nozzlenose D is a weapon that has a close potential for a three hit splat, or a one hit splat per  if the opponent has touched enemy ink for at least one frame.\n\n- 24 ability points – achievable with either eight subs or one main and five subs – are enough to reach the L-3 Nozzlenose D's damage cap of 33.3 HP.[7]\n\n- For a smaller but nearly-effective investment, 16 ability points – reached with six subs or one main and two subs – are enough to exceed 32 HP of damage, while 6 ability points – just two subs – will exceed 30 HP.[7]\n\nIncreases both running speed, notably while firing, and Inkjet movement speed.\n\nSuper Jumping to a teammate after respawning carries the risk of getting splatted upon landing, due to the appearance of a Super Jump indicator. When equipped, Stealth Jump better covers this indicator from long distance opponents, allowing its user to more safely return to the front lines and maintain pressure on the opponent.\n\nAllows the user to potentially roll away from enemy fire after Super Jumping, including notably after the Inkjet has expired. It also gives them a mobility boost for 3 seconds in the form of 10 AP of Run Speed Up, Swim Speed Up, and Ink Resistance Up.\n\n[8][9]"
