    "Although a slow, heavyweight weapon, the kit can be used to one's advantage to get plenty of splats. If one throws a sprinkler that damages the opponent, hitting an opponent with the explosher will finish them off. Also, if one traps an opponent inside the explosion from the weapon, the opponent will have a hard time escaping, so you can finish them off.",
    "Because the Explosher is a slow, heavy, long-ranged weapon, it can be easy to splat one.",
    "- Weapon classes like dualies and shooters can easily get up-close to splat an explosher.",
    "- Weapons like chargers can out-range an explosher and take them out easily.",
    "- Opponents that have mobile abilities and weapons can also get semi-close and splat from a sort of distance.",
    "- Throwing torpedos does not always work, as Explosher shots pierce the torpedo, but if the Explosher is distracted, it can be dangerous.",
    "Gear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.",
    "The Explosher is a reliable main weapon in many circumstances.",
    "- It is best suited to the anchor role, with long range and high damage. Its projectile moves in a slow arc, puncturing opponents in its path.",
    "- It can hit opponents above and below the user with ease and does well no matter the terrain.",
    "- The large explosion deals decent damage, and can be used to scatter enemy pushes.",
    "- While it lacks a one-hit splat, It can be used to finish off opponents that are chased toward you by your team.",
    "- The projectile's ink splatter can trap damaged opponents, making it easier to finish them off.",
    "- The projectile punctures targets similar to charger shots, which can be used to hit multiple people at once.",
    "On the contrary, the Explosher also has some disadvantages.",
    "- Lack of a one hit splat and slow fire rate make it difficult to deal with opponents who get up close.",
    "- High ink consumption makes it easy to find yourself in a position where you cannot move.",
    "- Being a heavy-weight weapon makes it harder to move around and get back into battle after getting splatted."
