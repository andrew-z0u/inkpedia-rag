  "content": "First introduced in the original Splatoon at the release of Version 2.0.0 on 6 August 2015, the Slosher is the first weapon of its class, characterized by firing large projectiles with high, (mostly) consistent damage in an arc trajectory, which enables its user to fire at opponents over ledges or other obstacles. While it lacks area of effect damage (unlike a Blaster), the Slosher's projectiles have a large hitbox, enabling it to be used in similar situations as a Blaster.\n\n- 1 Splatoon\n\n1.1 Use\n1.2 Synergy\n1.3 Countermeasures\n1.4 Gear abilities\n\n- 1.1 Use\n\n- 1.2 Synergy\n\n- 1.3 Countermeasures\n\n- 1.4 Gear abilities\n\n- 2 Splatoon 2\n\n2.1 Use\n2.2 Synergy\n2.3 Countermeasures\n2.4 Gear abilities\n\n- 2.1 Use\n\n- 2.2 Synergy\n\n- 2.3 Countermeasures\n\n- 2.4 Gear abilities\n\n- 3 Splatoon 3\n\n3.1 Use\n\n- 3.1 Use\n\n- 4 References\n\n- 1.1 Use\n\n- 1.2 Synergy\n\n- 1.3 Countermeasures\n\n- 1.4 Gear abilities\n\n- 2.1 Use\n\n- 2.2 Synergy\n\n- 2.3 Countermeasures\n\n- 2.4 Gear abilities\n\n- 3.1 Use\n\nCompared to its appearance in Splatoon 2, the Slosher has only minor tweaks to its performance.\n\n- Hitting opponents with the trail of ink rather than the main projectile will still do 70 damage instead of 50.\n\n- There are some changes to its mobility; the Slosher has slightly faster strafing speed while firing in this game (0.5 DU/f compared to 0.4 DU/f), but each slosh also has an additional four frames of endlag.\n\n- The weapon is less likely to paint the user's feet, further hampering its mobility.\n\nBurst Bombs are the centerpiece of this weapon's kit, giving it user plenty of uses:\n\n- Their quick damage makes them suitable for leading off attacks or finishing off injured opponents who attempt to flee. The Slosher has a devastating combo with Burst Bombs, especially when augmented with Damage Up. However, even without Damage Up, a slosh (70 damage) can still combo with the inner radius of splash damage (35 damage) by default.[1]\n\n- They instantly turf inkable surfaces, permitting either a fast pursuit of an opponent or a rapid retreat from an unfavorable situation.\n\n- Opponents hit by Burst Bombs will be surrounded by your team's ink, further limiting their health and mobility.\n\n- Direct hits will inflict 60 HP of damage, while splash damage will only deliver 25-35 HP. Always go for direct hits whenever possible.\n\n- Although less powerful than other bombs, a Burst Bomb can still damage or even destroy an opponent's Splash Wall, or or the Rainmaker shield, while detonating on contact.\nAny opponents caught within the Burst Bomb's explosion will get damaged or splatted.[2]\n\n- Any opponents caught within the Burst Bomb's explosion will get damaged or splatted.[2]\n\n- An opponent's Inkstrike or Kraken will defuse any Burst Bombs it comes in contact with, so hold off throwing them until after the special weapon finishes.\n\n- Any opponents caught within the Burst Bomb's explosion will get damaged or splatted.[2]\n\nInkstrike, while not as useful as a Kraken or Bubbler, still has some uses.\n\n- Because using the Inkstrike prevents players from spreading ink momentarily, requires them to concentrate on the , and has long endlag after use, those using an Inkstrike can be easily splatted. When using an Inkstrike, make sure to stay a safe distance away from the action, or hide behind a wall.\n\n- In Ranked Battle, using an Inkstrike directly on top of a Splat Zone or a Tower can turn the tide of the battle. In Rainmaker, it can easily destroy the shield or keep enemies from picking up the Rainmaker.\n\n- In Turf War, players can use the Inkstrike as a distraction by launching it at the opponents' side of the map.\n\n- Launching an Inkstrike deep into enemy territory at the end of a Turf War can cause an unavoidable swing of about 6% or 7%, which can determine the winner of a match.\n\nWhile the Slosher's Burst Bombs combo excellently with the weapon, they lack certain advantages offered by lethal bombs — particularly either Splat or Suction Bombs, which provide their user's team a couple advantages over another team that has no lethal bombs in its composition:\n\n- Their one-hit-splat offers its user's team chances of instantly gaining a numbers advantage, from which a game-winning push can arise.\n\n- Their lethal explosion provides space for its user's team to either push into an area held by the opponent or stall an opponent's push.\n\nInkstrike, while already does not benefit as much to a Slosher user, will not be as useful to a team if there are many players using it for a few reasons:\n\n- Other special weapons such as Kraken or Inkzooka can splat opponents more reliably than Inkstrike can.\n\n- Bomb Rush can turf more reliably because of how unpredictable it is. It also cannot be inked over like Inkstrike can.\n\n- Defense Up can be used to counter the Slosher's Burst Bomb combos.\n\n- Disruptors make opposing Sloshers a sitting duck due to the Disruptor increasing ink consumption, slowing ink recovery, and heavily reducing mobility.\n\n- Bubbler and Kraken, if you have them, can also be activated as a panic button in a pinch to stay alive and potentially splat the Slosher. The Slosher's slow fire rate makes it ineffective at pushing these special weapons back.\n\n- Matchups between Sloshers on opposing teams are determined by each player's skill, positioning, turf control, and the presence of any teammates.\n\n- A few slayer and support weapons outrange the Slosher without sacrificing too much mobility, making them good counters. For example, variants of the Splattershot Pro, the H-3 Nozzlenose, and the Dual Squelcher all have better range and firing rate than the Slosher.\n\n- To attack an opposing Slosher user with a shorter-ranged weapon, rely more on flanking or sharking to get close to them, then if possible, exploit their slow fire rate.\n\n- A long-ranged weapon, such as a charger or most splatlings, can attack an opposing Slosher user from long distance with impunity. However, once the opposing Slosher user gets close, the tables are turned, as it can outmaneuver and outdraw its less mobile, slower firing opponent.\n\n- A competent Slosher user is likely capable at both flanking and sharking:\nKeep track of all four members of the opposing team – which ones are present, which ones are splatted, and which ones are back at their spawn point.\nCheck the map periodically for opposing ink forming around flanks to anticipate a flanking attack.\nTo prevent sharking, check suspicious puddles of the opponents' ink, preferably with a thrown sub weapon.\nWeapons that track opponents, such as Point Sensors, temporarily prevent an opponent from sharking and makes them an easier target for long-ranged teammates to pick off.\n\n- Keep track of all four members of the opposing team – which ones are present, which ones are splatted, and which ones are back at their spawn point.\n\n- Check the map periodically for opposing ink forming around flanks to anticipate a flanking attack.\n\n- To prevent sharking, check suspicious puddles of the opponents' ink, preferably with a thrown sub weapon.\n\n- Weapons that track opponents, such as Point Sensors, temporarily prevent an opponent from sharking and makes them an easier target for long-ranged teammates to pick off.\n\n- When pursued by an opposing Slosher user, using almost any sub weapon (except for Squid Beakons) can either delay their pursuit or deter them from chasing.\n\n- Bombs will detonate on contact with an Inkstrike tornado, similarly to a Splash Wall. This can be used to splat unaware opponents standing in front of the tornado.\n\n- An Inkstrike turfs surfaces starting from the center before spreading out. If your weapon has the range to maintain a safe distance from the explosion of an opponent's Inkstrike, it is possible to maintain possession of a Splat Zone by turfing the center of where the Inkstrike landed.\n\n- Keep track of all four members of the opposing team – which ones are present, which ones are splatted, and which ones are back at their spawn point.\n\n- Check the map periodically for opposing ink forming around flanks to anticipate a flanking attack.\n\n- To prevent sharking, check suspicious puddles of the opponents' ink, preferably with a thrown sub weapon.\n\n- Weapons that track opponents, such as Point Sensors, temporarily prevent an opponent from sharking and makes them an easier target for long-ranged teammates to pick off.\n\nGear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.\n\nDamage Up significantly improves the consistency of the weapon's Burst Bomb combos.\n\n- 6 ability points, or two subs, will increase the damage of the main weapon to 73.95 and the outer radius of splash damage from a Burst Bomb to 26.41,[3] adding up to 100.36 damage. This offers the user much more leniency with their aim, allowing them to easily splat opponents.[1]\n\n- More Damage Up can be added to improve the combo's consistency against users wearing Defense Up.\n\nBurst Bombs have better stacking with Ink Saver (Sub) than in Splatoon 2, allowing its users to save more ink with each Burst Bomb thrown. This is particularly helpful for a Slosher, which relies on its Burst Bombs often.\n\n- 19 ability points, or a pure, will allow the user to throw three Burst Bombs from a full ink tank.[3]\n\nQuick Respawn will always shorten respawn time after getting splatted in this game, encouraging a Slosher user to remain aggressive even after getting splatted and is in general useful for brute forcing your way back into the stage.[1]\n\n- One main, or 10 ability points, reduces the respawn time from 8.5 seconds to 7.29 seconds.[3]\n\n- Two mains, or 20 ability points, drops this further to 6.29 seconds.[3]\n\nSuper Jumping to a teammate after respawning carries the risk of getting splatted upon landing, due to the appearance of a Super Jump indicator. When equipped, Stealth Jump hides this marker completely at the cost of a slower Super Jump both in startup and the jump itself. This pairs well with Quick Respawn.\n\nThe Slosher – along with the Hero Slosher Replica – is the first available weapon in the Slosher class. Its unique mechanics differ greatly from those of a shooter but allow it to more easily hit certain targets that a shooter cannot easily reach, such as an opponent hiding behind an obstacle.\n\nThe Slosher has the traits of a powerful slayer's weapon: high damage and medium range. However, its kit allows it to also play a supportive role as well.\n\n- Each tap of  flings a large globule of ink in an arcing trajectory followed by a thin trail of ink:\nThis trajectory enables a Slosher user to more easily attack opponents who are up on a ledge or up an incline, making a Slosher very effective at sharking beneath the opponents' perch, leading a push up walls or slopes, and taking flanking routes that require a considerable amount of climbing.\nThe arc-like trajectory also travels over obstacles that are not too tall, enabling a Slosher wield to hit opponents hiding behind them.\n\n- This trajectory enables a Slosher user to more easily attack opponents who are up on a ledge or up an incline, making a Slosher very effective at sharking beneath the opponents' perch, leading a push up walls or slopes, and taking flanking routes that require a considerable amount of climbing.\n\n- The arc-like trajectory also travels over obstacles that are not too tall, enabling a Slosher wield to hit opponents hiding behind them.\n\n- So long as a Slosher user is firing at at target that is not below them, the large globule consistently inflicts 70 HP of damage – just enough to splat most opponents weakened by a bomb's splash damage – while the thin ink trail inflicts 50 HP.\nUnlike most other weapons, such as shooters, the Slosher only suffers damage falloff if the target is below the Slosher wielder, reducing the damage by as much as 50%. Main Power Up can reduce this damage falloff.\nRegardless of any damage falloff, the large globule always delivers more damage than the thin trail of ink. Whenever possible, aim the reticle at your opponent to hit them with the large globule.\n\n- Unlike most other weapons, such as shooters, the Slosher only suffers damage falloff if the target is below the Slosher wielder, reducing the damage by as much as 50%.

Whenever possible, aim the reticle at your opponent to hit them with the large globule.\n\n- In addition to its high damage, the Slosher also has good range for a slayer's weapon (about 140 DU). Although this weapon has low range when aiming the reticle at the default position (), you can always aim higher to maximize your range — enough to outrange most shooters and dualies.\n\n- The Slosher suffers from a few notable drawbacks compared to shooters and dualies: slow firing rate, low mobility, and low ink efficiency.\nIts slow firing rate (12-16 frames before first shot, 30 frames between shots) allows a fully healthy opponent using a rapid firing shooter to potentially absorb one Slosher shot and still splat the Slosher wielder before the latter can fire their second shot.\nSuper Jump camping can also be difficult because of the slow firing rate. To splat a Super Jumping opponent at their landing spot, take advantage of the lack of falloff damage by firing a globule of ink above the marker a little before the opponent lands, then fire right when the opponent lands and, if you timed your first shot correctly, you should be able to splat the opponent.[6].\nA Slosher wielder is slowed down during (0.4 DU/f while firing) and after firing a shot (16 frames until either using a sub weapon or morphing into squid/octopus form) more than most shooter users are, making it a sitting target for opponents to exploit.\nThe Slosher's ink consumption (7%) is rather high for a slayer's weapon. Repetitive tapping of  – particularly after throwing a Suction Bomb – will quickly deplete the ink tank. Watch the ink tank and avoid traveling too far in the opponents' turf.\n\n- Its slow firing rate (12-16 frames before first shot, 30 frames between shots) allows a fully healthy opponent using a rapid firing shooter to potentially absorb one Slosher shot and still splat the Slosher wielder before the latter can fire their second shot.\nSuper Jump camping can also be difficult because of the slow firing rate.

Therefore, to stall or slow down the Tower's progress, throw a Suction Bomb onto one side of the Tower and fire upon the other side.[7]\n\n- Unless a Suction Bomb is perfectly upright on the stake atop the Tower, an opponent riding the Tower can use this stake to take cover from the blast radius. Therefore, to stall or slow down the Tower's progress, throw a Suction Bomb onto one side of the Tower and fire upon the other side.[7]\n\n- They can also be used to poke at and zone out opponents during the neutral phase, stall an opponent's push, or provide space to escape.\n\n- A Suction Bomb can damage or destroy an opponent's brella shield, Splash Wall, or Baller or the Rainmaker shield, while detonating on contact.\nAny opponents caught within the Suction Bomb's explosion will get damaged or splatted.[8]\nIt will also inflate or pop a teammate's bubbles but deflate or diffuse an opponent's bubbles, while still detonating on contact.[9]\n\n- Any opponents caught within the Suction Bomb's explosion will get damaged or splatted.[8]\n\n- It will also inflate or pop a teammate's bubbles but deflate or diffuse an opponent's bubbles, while still detonating on contact.[9]\n\n- An opponent's Splashdown or Booyah Bomb will defuse any Suction Bombs it touches, so hold off throwing them until after the special weapon finishes.\n\n- Unless a Suction Bomb is perfectly upright on the stake atop the Tower, an opponent riding the Tower can use this stake to take cover from the blast radius. Therefore, to stall or slow down the Tower's progress, throw a Suction Bomb onto one side of the Tower and fire upon the other side.[7]\n\n- Any opponents caught within the Suction Bomb's explosion will get damaged or splatted.[8]\n\n- It will also inflate or pop a teammate's bubbles but deflate or diffuse an opponent's bubbles, while still detonating on contact.[9]\n\nTenta Missiles can be used to locate and pressure opponents and force them out of position without having to commit too far forward:\n\n- It is recommended to only activate the Tenta Missiles at a safe distance from opponents, not only because a Tenta Missile user is vulnerable to close-range attacks but also because opponents who are further back are easier to track and home missiles on.\n\n- Sometimes, it may be more beneficial to target a specific opponent or two instead of all of them, based on their weapons, location, and situation:[10]\nOpponents wielding heavy, slow firing weapons will have a harder time escaping the missiles.\nOpponents who are bunched together are more likely to cause their teammates to receive collateral damage than those who are spread apart.\nTenta Missiles are also a reliable means of forcing opposing anchors to cede their ground and lose focus while aiming.[11] Sometimes, this is the only reliable means to push back into a zone or another important area of the stage.\nTenta Missiles can counter an opponent's Sting Ray or Booyah Bomb if anticipated early enough; an opponent will be forced to either delay or interrupt it to avoid getting splatted by the missiles, throwing off their aim.[12]\n\n- Opponents wielding heavy, slow firing weapons will have a harder time escaping the missiles.\n\n- Opponents who are bunched together are more likely to cause their teammates to receive collateral damage than those who are spread apart.\n\n- Tenta Missiles are also a reliable means of forcing opposing anchors to cede their ground and lose focus while aiming.[11] Sometimes, this is the only reliable means to push back into a zone or another important area of the stage.\n\n- Tenta Missiles can counter an opponent's Sting Ray or Booyah Bomb if anticipated early enough; an opponent will be forced to either delay or interrupt it to avoid getting splatted by the missiles, throwing off their aim.[12]\n\n- Opponents wielding heavy, slow firing weapons will have a harder time escaping the missiles.\n\n- Opponents who are bunched together are more likely to cause their teammates to receive collateral damage than those who are spread apart.\n\n- Tenta Missiles are also a reliable means of forcing opposing anchors to cede their ground and lose focus while aiming.[11] Sometimes, this is the only reliable means to push back into a zone or another important area of the stage.\n\n- Tenta Missiles can counter an opponent's Sting Ray or Booyah Bomb if anticipated early enough; an opponent will be forced to either delay or interrupt it to avoid getting splatted by the missiles, throwing off their aim.[12]\n\nThe Slosher is less capable of playing aggressively than its other variants, particularly the Soda Slosher, but it is more versatile, allowing it to play in ether an aggressive or supportive role. While it is not quite as versatile as some other weapons, such as the Kensa Splattershot, the Slosher can still fit in many team compositions.\n\n- Even though it is capable of playing a supportive role, unless two other slayer weapons are present on the team, it is recommended to have another supportive weapon present to free the Slosher wielder to play more offensively.\n\n- While not a poor turfing weapon, the Slosher greatly benefits if teamed up with a weapon that is more efficient at turfing, such as a Splattershot Jr. or an N-ZAP '85.\n\nWhile having multiple players on the same team launching Tenta Missiles might seem like a fun and easy means to cause opponents to scramble for cover, having too many players equipped with them – no more than one or two – can reduce the effectiveness of a team composition:[13]\n\n- Other special weapons, such as Inkjet or Sting Ray, are intended for splatting opponents and more capable at this than are Tenta Missiles.\n\n- Tenta Missiles cannot reliably turf highly contested areas of the stage as well as certain other special weapons, such as Bomb Launcher or Ink Storm.\n\nCoordinating with your teammates can greatly increase the Tenta Missiles' effect during a battle:\n\n- Launching Tenta Missiles just before a push can cause opponents to scatter, giving your team opportunities to pick off any opponents caught fleeing the Missiles.\n\n- Firing Tenta Missiles on defense can help stall an opponent's push, but make sure that your teammates are nearby the front lines to follow the Missiles up.\n\n- Launching Tenta Missiles while a teammate is using a special designed to splat opponents, such as Sting Ray or Inkjet, can limit the opponents' escape options and even prevent them from Super Jumping to safety.\n\n- Bomb Defense Up DX reduces the splash damage from both Suction Bombs (from 30 HP to 28.6 HP) and Tenta Missiles (from 50 HP to 48.3 HP),[14] improving its user's survivability against both the sub and special weapons of an opposing Slosher user.[15][16]\n\n- Matchups between Sloshers on opposing teams are determined by each player's skill, positioning, turf control, and the presence of any teammates.\n\n- A few slayer's and support weapons outrange the Slosher without sacrificing too much mobility, making them good counters. For example, variants of the Splattershot Pro, the H-3 Nozzlenose, and the Dualie Squelchers all have better range and firing rate than the Slosher.\n\n- To attack an opposing Slosher user with a shorter-ranged weapon, rely more on flanking or sharking to get close to them, then if possible, exploit their slow fire rate.\n\n- A long-ranged weapon, such as a charger or most splatlings, can attack an opposing Slosher user from long distance with impunity.

However, be ready to fend off any opponents – including the opposing Slosher user – who attempt to attack this other side.[17]\n\n- Be mindful of both when the opponent has Tenta Missiles ready and when the missiles are launched:\nIf an opponent attempts to launch them when nearby you, splat them quickly to reduce or even cancel their deployment.\nWhen the opponent deploys their Tenta Missiles, avoid getting close to teammates - even when not targeted, as a targeted player crossing paths with a teammate might cause the other to get injured or splatted.\nWhenever targeted by opposing Tenta Missiles, unless actively engaging an opponent, only move enough to avoid damage and reduce the amount of turfing by the Missiles.[18]\n\n- If an opponent attempts to launch them when nearby you, splat them quickly to reduce or even cancel their deployment.\n\n- When the opponent deploys their Tenta Missiles, avoid getting close to teammates - even when not targeted, as a targeted player crossing paths with a teammate might cause the other to get injured or splatted.\n\n- Whenever targeted by opposing Tenta Missiles, unless actively engaging an opponent, only move enough to avoid damage and reduce the amount of turfing by the Missiles.[18]\n\n- Keep track of all four members of the opposing team – which ones are present, which ones are splatted, and which ones are back at their spawn point.\n\n- Check the map periodically for opposing ink forming around flanks to anticipate a flanking attack.\n\n- To prevent sharking, check suspicious puddles of the opponents' ink, preferably with a thrown sub weapon.\n\n- Weapons that track opponents, such as Point Sensors, temporarily prevent an opponent from sharking and makes them an easier target for long-ranged teammates to pick off.\n\n- If an opponent attempts to launch them when nearby you, splat them quickly to reduce or even cancel their deployment.\n\n- When the opponent deploys their Tenta Missiles, avoid getting close to teammates - even when not targeted, as a targeted player crossing paths with a teammate might cause the other to get injured or splatted.\n\n- Whenever targeted by opposing Tenta Missiles, unless actively engaging an opponent, only move enough to avoid damage and reduce the amount of turfing by the Missiles.[18]\n\nGear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.\n\nA Slosher user in a slayer role generally gets close enough to the opponent and their bombs. Ever since its introduction in version 4.3.0, Bomb Defense Up DX will not only reduce the damage taken from opposing sub and special weapons that are not one-hit-splat but will also reduce the duration of the tracking effects of certain opponent's sub and special weapons, such as Point Sensors and Ink Mines, allowing the user of this ability to evade detection more easily. Just three ability points, or one sub, offer plenty of utility:[15][16]\n\n- The splash damage of most bombs is reduced from 30 HP to 28.6 HP. This reduction in damage provides two benefits:\nIt prevents its user from being exposed on their opponents' map by the splash damage of most single bombs.\nInk Armor will not break due to splash damage from a single bomb whose splash damage normally inflicts 30 HP of damage.\n\n- It prevents its user from being exposed on their opponents' map by the splash damage of most single bombs.\n\n- Ink Armor will not break due to splash damage from a single bomb whose splash damage normally inflicts 30 HP of damage.\n\n- The splash damage of near-misses from either Tenta Missiles or Inkjet, the minimum splash damage of bubbles, and the collision damage from Baller are all reduced from 50 HP to 48.3 HP,[14] enabling one to survive two hits from any of these specific means of special weapon damage.\n\n- It prevents its user from being exposed on their opponents' map by the splash damage of most single bombs.\n\n- Ink Armor will not break due to splash damage from a single bomb whose splash damage normally inflicts 30 HP of damage.\n\nUnless a Slosher wielder is on an extended splatting streak, they can expect to get splatted often. When equipped, Comeback grants 10 ability points of six different stackable abilities for twenty seconds after respawning from getting splatted by an opponent:\n\n- Ink Recovery Up\n\n- Ink Saver (Main)\n\n- Ink Saver (Sub)\n\n- Run Speed Up\n\n- Swim Speed Up\n\n- Special Charge Up\n\nBecause the Slosher consumes ink quickly, both Ink Saver (Main) and Ink Saver (Sub) are the most useful for a Slosher user, allowing them to pursue and pressure the opponent upon returning from spawn with less worry about their ink efficiency.[15]\n\nAny good slayer like a Slosher user is expected to come in contact with the opponent's ink on various surfaces, which can both be damaging and reduce mobility. Ink Resistance Up not only partially offsets the reduction in mobility but also delays the damage taken from contact with opposing ink.[15][16]\n\n- Just three ability points, or one sub,…\n…delays the damage taken from opposing ink by 10 frames.\n…reduces the damage taken from 0.3 HP/f (health points per frame) to 0.2 HP/f.\n…lowers the limit on the amount of damage opposing ink on surfaces can inflict from 40 HP to 38 HP.\n…increases the normal running speed in opposing ink from 0.24 DU/f to 0.33 DU/f.[19]\n…increases the jumping height in opposing ink from 0.8 to 0.854.[14]\n\n- …delays the damage taken from opposing ink by 10 frames.\n\n- …reduces the damage taken from 0.3 HP/f (health points per frame) to 0.2 HP/f.\n\n- …lowers the limit on the amount of damage opposing ink on surfaces can inflict from 40 HP to 38 HP.\n\n- …increases the normal running speed in opposing ink from 0.24 DU/f to 0.33 DU/f.[19]\n\n- …increases the jumping height in opposing ink from 0.8 to 0.854.[14]\n\n- Six ability point, or two subs,…\n…delays the damage taken from opposing ink by 15 frames.\n…reduces the damage taken to 0.2 HP/f.\n…lowers the damage limit of opposing ink to 36.2 HP.\n…increases the normal running speed in opposing ink to 0.39 DU/f.[19]\n…increases the jumping height in opposing ink to 0.888.[14]\n\n- …delays the damage taken from opposing ink by 15 frames.\n\n- …reduces the damage taken to 0.2 HP/f.\n\n- …lowers the damage limit of opposing ink to 36.2 HP.\n\n- …increases the normal running speed in opposing ink to 0.39 DU/f.[19]\n\n- …increases the jumping height in opposing ink to 0.888.[14]\n\n- …delays the damage taken from opposing ink by 10 frames.\n\n- …reduces the damage taken from 0.3 HP/f (health points per frame) to 0.2 HP/f.\n\n- …lowers the limit on the amount of damage opposing ink on surfaces can inflict from 40 HP to 38 HP.\n\n- …increases the normal running speed in opposing ink from 0.24 DU/f to 0.33 DU/f.[19]\n\n- …increases the jumping height in opposing ink from 0.8 to 0.854.[14]\n\n- …delays the damage taken from opposing ink by 15 frames.\n\n- …reduces the damage taken to 0.2 HP/f.\n\n- …lowers the damage limit of opposing ink to 36.2 HP.\n\n- …increases the normal running speed in opposing ink to 0.39 DU/f.[19]\n\n- …increases the jumping height in opposing ink to 0.888.[14]\n\nLast-Ditch Effort is a headgear-exclusive ability that, under specific conditions, grants its user 1 to 24 ability points each of the following abilities:\n\n- Ink Saver (Main)\n\n- Ink Saver (Sub)\n\n- Ink Recovery Up\n\nThese abilities only begin to take effect under either of the following conditions:\n\n- There are at most 30 seconds remaining on the game clock, or Overtime has begun in a Ranked Battle, at which the maximum 24 ability points will be granted for each of the above abilities.\n\n- In a Ranked Battle, the opposing team's countdown has at most 50 points remaining. The effects of Last-Ditch Effort increase as the opposing team's countdown decreases from 50 to 30 points remaining, starting with 1 ability point for each ability and maxing out to 24 ability points.\n\nThe Slosher can greatly benefit from both the overall reduced ink consumption and quicker ink recovery, allowing its user to more freely use either the main weapon or Suction Bombs during either a crucial defensive stand or a late attempt to reclaim the lead.[15]\n\nQuick Respawn shortens respawn time after getting splatted (under specific conditions), encouraging a Slosher user to remain aggressive even after getting splatted.[15]\n\n- 16 ability points – one main and two subs – are enough to reduce the respawn time from 8.5 seconds to 6.67 seconds.\n\n- 26 ability points – two mains and two subs – are enough to reduce the respawn time from 8.5 seconds to 5.8 seconds.[19]\n\nQuick Super Jump decreases both the \"charge\" time before and the travel time of a Super Jump. Both aggressive and supportive Slosher users will benefit since Quick Super Jump allows them to both return to the front lines more quickly and escape unfavorable situations more easily to preserve special gauge progress.[15][16]\n\n- One sub, or 3 ability points, of Quick Super Jump decreases the \"charge\" time by 22 frames, or 0.36 seconds.[19]\n\nSuper Jumping to a teammate after respawning carries the risk of getting splatted upon landing, due to the appearance of a Super Jump indicator. When equipped, Stealth Jump better covers this indicator from long distance opponents, allowing its user to more safely return to the front lines and maintain pressure on the opponent.[15][16]\n[20]\n\nAvailable since the Splatoon 3 Splatfest World Premiere, the Slosher (as well as the Order Slosher Replica) comes with a weapon set that provides tools for both displacement and area denial and complements the main weapon's spacing capability.\n\nThe unique trajectory, medium range, and large hitbox of a Slosher's attack give it the traits of a skirmisher's weapon:[21]\n\n- Each tap of  flings a large globule of ink in an arc trajectory followed by a thin trail of ink:\nThe arc trajectory enables a Slosher user to more easily attack opponents who are up on a ledge or up an incline, making a Slosher very effective at sharking beneath ledges, leading a push up walls or slopes, and taking flanking routes that require a considerable amount of climbing.\nThe arc trajectory also travels over obstacles that are not too tall, enabling a Slosher wielder to hit opponents hiding behind them.\n\n- The arc trajectory enables a Slosher user to more easily attack opponents who are up on a ledge or up an incline, making a Slosher very effective at sharking beneath ledges, leading a push up walls or slopes, and taking flanking routes that require a considerable amount of climbing.\n\n- The arc trajectory also travels over obstacles that are not too tall, enabling a Slosher wielder to hit opponents hiding behind them.\n\n- So long as a Slosher user is firing at at target that is not below them, the large globule consistently inflicts 70 HP of damage – just enough to splat most opponents weakened by a bomb's splash damage – while the thin ink trail inflicts 50 HP.\nUnlike most other weapons, such as shooters, the Slosher only suffers damage falloff if the target is below the Slosher wielder, reducing the damage to a minimum of 50 HP since Version 3.1.0.\nRegardless of any damage falloff, the large globule always delivers more damage than the thin trail of ink. Whenever possible, aim the reticle at your opponent to hit them with the large globule.\n\n- Unlike most other weapons, such as shooters, the Slosher only suffers damage falloff if the target is below the Slosher wielder, reducing the damage to a minimum of 50 HP since Version 3.1.0.\n\n- Regardless of any damage falloff, the large globule always delivers more damage than the thin trail of ink. Whenever possible, aim the reticle at your opponent to hit them with the large globule.\n\n- In addition to its high damage, the Slosher also has medium range (about 140 DU) — enough to outrange many slayer's weapons. Although this weapon has low range when aiming the reticle at the default position (), you can always aim higher to maximize your range.\n\n- The arc trajectory enables a Slosher user to more easily attack opponents who are up on a ledge or up an incline, making a Slosher very effective at sharking beneath ledges, leading a push up walls or slopes, and taking flanking routes that require a considerable amount of climbing.\n\n- The arc trajectory also travels over obstacles that are not too tall, enabling a Slosher wielder to hit opponents hiding behind them.\n\n- Unlike most other weapons, such as shooters, the Slosher only suffers damage falloff if the target is below the Slosher wielder, reducing the damage to a minimum of 50 HP since Version 3.1.0.\n\n- Regardless of any damage falloff, the large globule always delivers more damage than the thin trail of ink. Whenever possible, aim the reticle at your opponent to hit them with the large globule.\n\nThe Slosher suffers from a few notable drawbacks compared to shooters and dualies: slow firing rate, slow strafe speed, and low ink efficiency.[21]\n\n- Shooters and dualies generally have higher firing rates and, thus, higher damage per second than the Slosher (12-16 frames before first shot, 30 frames between shots), enabling their users to more quickly splat the Slosher user if they get close enough. If at full health, they can even tank one Slosher shot and still splat the Slosher wielder before the latter can fire their second shot.\nA Slosher user can hasten their splatting time by aiming their first shot high above their target and then firing their second one directly. Because of the long time between shots, this tactic is most practical when either Super Jump camping or flanking an unaware opponent.[21]\n\n- A Slosher user can hasten their splatting time by aiming their first shot high above their target and then firing their second one directly. Because of the long time between shots, this tactic is most practical when either Super Jump camping or flanking an unaware opponent.[21]\n\n- A Slosher wielder has a slow strafe speed while firing (0.4 DU/f while firing) and long lag after firing (16 frames until either using a sub weapon or morphing into squid/octopus form), making them a sitting target for opponents to exploit.\n\n- The Slosher's ink consumption (7.6%) is rather high. Repetitive tapping of  – particularly after throwing a Splat Bomb – will quickly deplete the ink tank.\nWatch the ink tank, refrain from firing more than twice in a row, and avoid traveling too far in the opponents' turf.\nSwimming in between shots or pairs of shots will improve your mobility and refill your ink tank.\n\n- Watch the ink tank, refrain from firing more than twice in a row, and avoid traveling too far in the opponents' turf.\n\n- Swimming in between shots or pairs of shots will improve your mobility and refill your ink tank.\n\n- A Slosher user can hasten their splatting time by aiming their first shot high above their target and then firing their second one directly.
