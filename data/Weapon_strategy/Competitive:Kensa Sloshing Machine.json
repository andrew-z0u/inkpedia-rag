Always be alert of the opponents' flanking and sharking attempts to avoid being caught.\nIt has similar ranged to other mid-line slayer's weapons – notably the Splattershot Pro, other sloshers, and the Dualie Squelchers – and, unlike slayer's weapons of comparable range, does not have as much mobility.\n\n- Its slower firing rate leaves it vulnerable at close range to more rapid-firing weapons, such as a Splattershot or Splash-o-matic — especially if the opponent lands the first shot.

It can also provide distance between a rushing opponent when thrown towards the ground.[2]\nOffensively, it can create paths with its ink trail that lead to up and tight close confrontations.\nInk Saver (Sub) or Last-Ditch Effort can reduce the ink consumption needed to throw a Fizzy Bomb to below half of a full ink tank, making it possible to throw two Fizzy Bombs one after the other. This provides great pressure through ink coverage and splash damage hits.\n\n- The Fizzy Bomb can create combos of splash damage with the hits from the main weapon and with the Splashdown special.\n\n- The Fizzy Bomb can explode multiple times, making it easier to explode Bubbles or inflate them.\n\n- Defensively, it can provide great pressure on the objective or onto opponents trying to take control over areas.

This provides great pressure through ink coverage and splash damage hits.\n\n- The Splashdown can either turn the tide of a battle or be canceled quite easily.\nThe Splashdown can create combos of splash damage with the hits from the main weapon or with the Fizzy Bombs.\nThe most safe way to activate a Splashdown is by Super Jumping to a teammate. This provides no dealing damage as the user is not through mid-Splashdown but rather through a Super Jump.\nUsing Super Jump can be a surprise for opponents that are not aware of the UI that indicates specials ready from the opponent team.\nMost weapons can cancel the special mid-Splashdown, so it is best to make sure that the opponent you are confronting has a weapon that takes multiple shots for a splat or has low range.\nThe Splashdown can cancel formation of Bubbles making it a quick and fast way of removing them.\nThe Splashdown can be used from higher ledges making it more powerful and extending its radius of splash damage.\nThe worst scenario for a Splashdown is when used as a panic button to get out from a sticky situation, as it can be predicted and aimed for it to be canceled.\n\n- The Splashdown can create combos of splash damage with the hits from the main weapon or with the Fizzy Bombs.\n\n- The most safe way to activate a Splashdown is by Super Jumping to a teammate.

For example, the Splattershot Pro, the Nautilus 47, the Dualie Squelchers, and their respective variants all counter the Kensa Sloshing Machine rather well.\n\n- To successfully confront a Kensa Sloshing Machine with a weaker or shorter ranged weapon, rely on flanking or sharking to safely approach the opponent, try to land the first shot, and exploit either the opponent's lower firing rate or slower mobility.\nIn case of the Kensa Sloshing Machine user is aware of your location, fast movement and misleading directions can help shorten the distance for up close confrontations.\n\n- In case of the Kensa Sloshing Machine user is aware of your location, fast movement and misleading directions can help shorten the distance for up close confrontations.\n\n- Any long-ranged weapon, such as a charger or most splatlings, can attack a Kensa Sloshing Machine from long distance with impunity until the latter gets too close.\n\n- The weapon suffers from high ink consumption of 8.4% per shot. Long confrontation might make the opponent weary and low on ink for taking the upper hand.\nIf wielding a brella, refrain from launching the shield at an opposing Kensa Sloshing Machine user as they are quite effective blocking incoming splash damage .\n\n- If wielding a brella, refrain from launching the shield at an opposing Kensa Sloshing Machine user as they are quite effective blocking incoming splash damage .\n\n- A Kensa Sloshing Machine user will likely go for both flanking and sharking to maximize the use of their weapon:\nKeep track of all four members of the opposing team – which ones are present, which ones are splatted, and which ones are back at their spawn point.\nCheck the map periodically for opposing ink forming around flanks to anticipate a flanking attack.\nTo prevent sharking, check suspicious puddles of the opponents' ink, preferably with a thrown sub weapon.\nWeapons that track opponents, such as Point Sensors, temporarily prevent an opponent from sharking and makes them an easier target for long-ranged teammates to pick off.\n\n- Keep track of all four members of the opposing team – which ones are present, which ones are splatted, and which

long-ranged teammates to pick off.\n\n- An opponent's Fizzy Bomb is often a hindrance, but it can be worked around:\nShaking Fizzy Bombs for multiple explosions takes time and effort that makes the Kensa Sloshing Machine user busy, exploiting that time to engage the opponent can be tricky but can be rewarding if approached successfully or from an unnoticed direction.\nFizzy Bombs prevent pathways with their splash damage hits, taking different route or higher platforms to engage can help break choke points or bomb spam.\nFizzy Bomb takes 60% ink consumption from the ink tank (when used without Ink Saver (Sub)), paying attention to when one or two were thrown can help ease battles against the Kensa Sloshing Machine user when they are low on ink and unable to respond.\n\n-

chargers.\nKensa Sloshing Machine user can be seen having their special ready through the opponent's glowing hair or through the UI at the top, being alert to their special ready can help cancel it when used poorly.\nThe Kensa Sloshing Machine user might go for risky plays as they know they have the Splashdown ready as a safety net. It is possible to bait them to take control of an open space and surprise them with a teammate to force a mid-Splashdown situation and cancel it.\n\n- Kensa Sloshing Machine user can be seen having their special ready through the opponent's glowing hair or through the UI at the top, being alert to their special ready can help cancel it when used poorly.\n\n- The Kensa Sloshing Machine user might go for risky plays as they know they have the Splashdown ready as a safety net.

This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.\n\n2 sub abilities are typically used to give two extra sloshes.\n\nInk Saver (Sub) or Last-Ditch Effort can reduce the ink consumption needed to throw a Fizzy Bomb to below half of a full ink tank, making it possible to throw two Fizzy Bombs one after the other. This provides great pressure through ink coverage and splash damage hits.\n\nNinja Squid allows its user to swim undetected to help sneak up to opponents but also reduces the maximum swimming speed.\n\nWhen splatted mid-Splashdown, the user loses only 25% of the special gauge. Decreasing it with Special Saver makes the special almost ready again for use through Super Jump or during battle.\n\nStealth Jump can help cover the indicator of the Super Jump in long distances to come back faster to the action or surprise the opponents with a Splashdown.\n\nSwim Speed Up can help engage and disengage from battles much more swiftly, while Run Speed Up and help maneuver movement during battle when firing the weapon. Both working together as an aggressive build for chasing down opponents and not end up with a trade.\n\n[3][4]"
