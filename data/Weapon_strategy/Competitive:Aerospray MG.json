    "Like the Splattershot Jr., the Aerospray MG is a support weapon:",
    "Suction Bombs can be used in a similar fashion to Splat Bombs, with a few differences:",
    "While less reliable than its other variants, the Curling-Bomb Launcher can still perform some of its intended tasks, namely repel opponents' pushes:",
    "The Aerospray MG does hold some solid niches with some map and mode combos.[7]",
    "Like the Splattershot Jr., the Aerospray MG excels at turfing and building up its special but is short-ranged and weak in direct combat. Therefore, it is recommended that its teammates have weapons that are capable of confronting opponents either head-on or from a distance.",
    "Gear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.",
    "Ever since its introduction in version 4.3.0, Bomb Defense Up DX will not only reduce the damage taken from opposing sub and special weapons that are not one-hit-splat but will also reduce the duration of the tracking effects of certain opponent's sub and special weapons, such as Point Sensors and Ink Mines, allowing the user of this ability to evade detection more easily. This is a useful ability for almost any player, even a Aerospray MG user, who does not directly engage their opponents. Just one sub, or three ability points, offers plenty of utility:",
    "Any player, including a Aerospray MG user who avoids direct confrontations, is expected to come in contact with the opponent's ink on various surfaces, which can both be damaging and reduce mobility. Ink Resistance Up not only partially offsets the reduction in mobility but also delays the damage taken from contact with opposing ink. Just one sub, or three ability points…",
    "Ink Saver (Sub) allows more frequent use of Suction Bombs and saves ink for the main weapon after each Suction Bomb used. Because a Aerospray MG user will be using more Suction Bombs than other weapons, having constant will help the user push in.",
    "Last-Ditch Effort is a headgear-exclusive ability that, under specific conditions, grants its user 1 to 24 ability points for each of the following abilities:",
    "These abilities only begin to take effect under either of the following conditions:",
    "Like other support weapons whose builds include bombs, the Aerospray MG. can greatly benefit from the reduced ink consumption per Suction Bomb used, allowing its user to spam Suction Bombs during either a crucial defensive stand or a late attempt to reclaim the lead.",
    "An ability exclusive to shoes, Object Shredder provides an Aerospray MG user three specific benefits:",
    "The Aerospray MG benefits most from the second buff, allowing it to consistently break Ink Armor in one hit.",
    "Special Charge Up accelerates building up the special gauge for the Curling-Bomb Launcher. As one of its strengths being able to farm Curling-Bomb Launcher, having constant Curling-Bomb Launchers will help with pushing or stalling.",
    "Swim Speed Up increases swim speed. Because a Aerospray MG user has a hard time splatting, Swim Speed Up can help escape the situation or to push in.[10]",
    "[11]",
    "Like the Splattershot Jr., the Aerospray MG is a support weapon.",
    "- It has an even wider shot spread and faster firing rate than the Splattershot Jr., enabling it to turf large areas in a short amount of time, which helps either gain or maintain map control, capture zones in Splat Zones, and build up Curling-Bomb Launcher very quickly.",
    "- The rapid firing rate and turfing of the Aerospray MG are offset by its very low damage (24 HP – the weakest in Splatoon 2), short range (103.89 DU[1] – equal to that of the Splattershot Jr.), and poor accuracy, which make it a poor main weapon for confronting most opponents head-on.\nWhile still capable of splatting opponents within its short range, playing too aggressively risks depriving the user's team of both map control.\nOtherwise, if a certain matchup is disadvantageous, disengage by Super Jumping back to the spawn point if necessary.",
    "- Compared to the Splattershot Jr., the Aerospray MG has both a smaller ink tank with which to completely deny space during the neutral phase. If engaged in a one-on-one against an opposing Splattershot Jr., try to splat them quickly, as the Splattershot Jr.'s more damaging bombs and larger ink tank capacity will likely be too much to contend with in a long, protracted slugfest.",
    "- While still capable of splatting opponents within its short range, playing too aggressively risks depriving the user's team of both map control.",
    "- Otherwise, if a certain matchup is disadvantageous, disengage by Super Jumping back to the spawn point if necessary.",
    "- They can attach to surfaces, which both allows more room for error when aiming and enables the planting of craftier traps, such as underneath a grate.",
    "- They take two seconds after attaching to a surface to detonate, as opposed to one second for a Splat Bomb, so plant Suction Bombs earlier than usual.",
    "- They inflict more damage from a direct hit (220 HP) and have a larger overall radius of damage (80 DU).",
    "- They can be thrown to lead a push into a Splat Zone or any other important area of the stage, such as the opponents' street or platform.",
    "- They can also flush out opposing anchors from perches and clear other critical areas, such as the Tower.[2]",
    "- They can also be used to poke at and zone out opponents during the neutral phase, stall an opponent's push, or provide space to escape.",
    "- A Suction Bomb can damage or destroy an opponent's brella shield, Splash Wall, or Baller or the Rainmaker shield, while detonating on contact.\nAny opponents caught within the Suction Bomb's explosion will get damaged or splatted.[3]\nIt will also inflate or pop a teammate's bubbles but deflate or diffuse an opponent's bubbles, while still detonating on contact.[4]",
    "- An opponent's Splashdown or Booyah Bomb will defuse any Suction Bombs it touches, so hold off throwing them until after the special weapon finishes.",
    "- Any opponents caught within the Suction Bomb's explosion will get damaged or splatted.[3]",
    "- It will also inflate or pop a teammate's bubbles but deflate or diffuse an opponent's bubbles, while still detonating on contact.[4]",
    "- Using any Bomb Launcher too close to an opponent will leave its user vulnerable to attack, so activate it outside the range of the opponent.",
    "- Remember that each bomb can be charged by holding  before releasing to launch it further, enabling the Bomb Launcher user to remain at a safer distance at the cost of launching fewer bombs in the duration of the special.",
    "- Do not forget that the main weapon may still be used during the duration of the special. Not only is this a useful self-defense tactic in case an opponent gets close, it allows one to pick off opponents caught fleeing from the Curling Bombs.",
    "- Curling-Bomb Launcher can either capture or hold onto a zone or another important area of the map, such as around the opponents' clam basket.",
    "- Launched bombs can damage or destroy an opponent's brella shield, Splash Wall, or Baller or the Rainmaker shield, while detonating on contact.\nAny opponents caught within a bomb's explosion will get damaged or splatted .[5]\nIt will also inflate or pop a teammate's bubbles but deflate or diffuse an opponent's bubbles, while still detonating on contact.[6]",
    "- An opponent's Splashdown or Booyah Bomb will defuse any Curling Bombs it comes in contact with, so hold off on activating Curling-Bomb Launcher until after the opponent's special weapon finishes whenever possible.",
    "- Any opponents caught within a bomb's explosion will get damaged or splatted .[5]",
    "- It will also inflate or pop a teammate's bubbles but deflate or diffuse an opponent's bubbles, while still detonating on contact.[6]",
    "- The Aerospray MG, while slightly worse than a Sploosh-o-matic 7, has a solid niche in Rainmaker with its Suction Bomb and cheap Bomb-Launcher.",
    "- It can also do well on some maps such as Skipper Pavilion or Humpback Pump Track where Curling-Bomb Launcher can turf very well. Its high turfing also allows to easily take control of a zone.",
    "- Turfing while following a teammate builds up Curling-Bomb Launcher and provides friendly turf to which a teammate can retreat whenever needed. This is particularly helpful for slayer teammates whose weapons are poor at turfing, such as a Splattershot Pro or a blaster.",
    "- Cooperate with the teammate using primarily Suction Bombs when engaging an opponent: attack from different angles, or force the opponent to come within range of the teammate's weapon.",
    "- If a teammate gets splatted and the opponent(s) is/are still present, then consider retreating instead of risking getting splatted and losing Curling-Bomb Launcher progress.",
    "- The Aerospray MG is generally a poor main weapon for splatting, so almost any weapon with longer range, better accuracy, or higher damage can defeat it in a one-on-one with relative ease.",
    "- An Aerospray MG will most likely stay nearby a teammate armed with a more formidable weapon; that opponent is usually the higher priority. Either find a teammate to assist or try to lure the Aerospray MG's teammate to stray too far from them to receive assistance.",
    "- Splashdown and Booyah Bomb, if timed properly, can negate the Curling-Bombs of a Curling-Bomb Launcher.",
    "- A counter Bomb Launcher can nullify the effects of Curling-Bomb Launcher, preventing its user's team from either capping a zone or continuing a push.",
    "- The splash damage of most bombs is reduced from 30 HP to 28.6 HP. This reduction in damage provides two benefits:\nIt prevents its user from being exposed on their opponents' map by the splash damage of most single bombs.\nInk Armor will not break due to splash damage from a single bomb whose splash damage normally inflicts 30 HP of damage.",
    "- The splash damage of near-misses from either Tenta Missiles or Inkjet, the minimum splash damage of bubbles, and the collision damage from Baller are all reduced from 50 HP to 48.3 HP, enabling one to survive two hits from any of these specific means of special weapon damage.",
    "- It prevents its user from being exposed on their opponents' map by the splash damage of most single bombs.",
    "- Ink Armor will not break due to splash damage from a single bomb whose splash damage normally inflicts 30 HP of damage.",
    "- …delays the damage taken from opposing ink by 10 frames.",
    "- …reduces the damage taken from 0.3 HP/f (health points per frame) to 0.2 HP/f.",
    "- …lowers the limit on the amount of damage opposing ink on surfaces can inflict from 40 HP to 38 HP.",
    "- …increases the normal running speed in opposing ink from 0.24 DU/f to 0.33 DU/f.[8]",
    "- …increases the jumping height in opposing ink from 0.8 to 0.854.",
    "- Ink Saver (Main)",
    "- Ink Saver (Sub)",
    "- Ink Recovery Up",
    "- There are at most 30 seconds remaining on the game clock, or Overtime has begun in a Ranked Battle, at which the maximum 24 ability points will be granted for each of the above abilities.",
    "- In a Ranked Battle, the opposing team's countdown has at most 50 points remaining. The effects of Last-Ditch Effort increase as the opposing team's countdown decreases from 50 to 30 points remaining, starting with 1 ability point for each ability and maxing out to 24 ability points.",
    "- It increases their damage dealt to bubbles – both friendly and opposing – by 30%, allowing for quicker growing and popping of bubbles.",
    "- It triples the amount of damage inflicted onto armored opponents, allowing an Aerospray MG to break an opponent's Ink Armor in one hit. Its low damage of 24 will not break Ink Armor in one hit, so Object Shredder will allow the weapon to break armor in one hit. The Suction Bombs and Curling Bombs' splash damage will both be able to break an opponent's Ink Armor even if they are wearing Bomb Defense Up DX.",
    "- It enables them to pop the Rainmaker shield more quickly with either their main weapon or Suction Bombs, allowing their team to start or restart a push more quickly while gaining a large amount of turf control in the immediate area.",
    "- 10 ability points – one main – effectively reduce the special gauge requirement to below 150p.[9]",
    "- Because of its wide shot spread and high fire rate, it is very good at gaining or maintaining map control, charging Reefslider, and taking the zone in Splat Zones.",
    "- It has bad accuracy and low damage, making it unfit for combat unless the player is very close to their opponent.",
    "- Fizzy Bombs are very useful for moving around quickly, which is very important for this weapon; they can be used like mobility bombs such as the Curling Bomb or like solely lethal bombs such as Splat Bombs.\nThe number of explosions it makes is determined by how long the player holds the bomb. It requires all three explosions to be truly lethal.",
    "- The Reefslider is useful for charging in and doing things such as taking control in Splat Zones, but it is advised to coordinate the attack with other team members as otherwise the Aerospray could be picked off by long range weapons once the special is over.",
    "- The number of explosions it makes is determined by how long the player holds the bomb. It requires all three explosions to be truly lethal.",
    "- Due to the low range of the Aerospray, it can benefit from long range weapons like chargers or splatlings.",
    "- The Aerospray is a weapon that specializes in turfing; therefore, for a team to be effective, the Aerospray must be paired with some kind of slayer weapon to handle the enemy while the Aerospray turfs.",
    "- The Fizzy Bomb can be used to reach and damage farther back enemies.\nIt can also push them to a certain spot as well.",
    "- The Reefslider can drive out and kill hidden enemies to become a threat to the opposing team.",
    "- Because the Aerospray specializes in turfing, the Aerospray can also be used in Splat Zones.",
    "- It can also push them to a certain spot as well.",
    "- Due to the Aerospray's short range, it is vulnerable against long range weapons like chargers and splatlings.",
    "- Because of its poor damage, it is easily defeated by slayers.",
    "- The Aerospray is a weapon that does not excel in aim; though it can still be useful without it. The lack of aim can be used to the advantage of others.",
    "- Fizzy Bomb is only lethal with all three explosions, and each explosion has a small blast radius.",
    "- When using Reefslider, the user is left vulnerable for a brief moment, which can be exploited by opponents.",
    "- Special Charge Up is a useful ability as it allows the Aerospray to farm Reefslider more easily.",
    "- Special Saver lets you keep more of your special points after you die, so getting splatted is less of a setback.",
    "- Special Power Up increases the blast radius of the Reefslider's explosion. This makes it more effective at range.",
    "- The Fizzy Bomb uses up 60% of your ink. Since this is the only ranged option, Sub Saver helps you farm it."
