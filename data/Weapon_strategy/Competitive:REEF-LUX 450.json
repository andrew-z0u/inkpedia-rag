Similar to the Tri-Stringer, this weapon launches a trio of ink bullets that can immediately splat enemies if charged long enough. Dissimilarly, this weapon charges faster, can hold a full charge in swim form, but cannot fire exploding projectiles.\n\n- The REEF-LUX 450 is a support weapon because:\nIts fast fire rate and excellent turfing ability allows it to provide map control for teammates.\nIts paints for the special Tenta Missiles, which help your team push forward to certain areas on the stage.\n\n- Its fast fire rate and excellent turfing ability allows it to provide map control for teammates.\n\n- Its paints for the special Tenta Missiles, which help your team push forward to certain areas on the stage.\n\n- The REEF-LUX is a slayer weapon because:\nIt can charge its fatal ink bullets almost instantly.\nIts charge speed in the air also matches its charge speed on the ground, similar to the Squiffer. This allows the weapon to jump repeatedly to avoid enemy fire without a charge speed penalty.\nIt can hold its charge, allowing it to quickly move around into better positions.\n\n- It can charge its fatal ink bullets almost instantly.\n\n- Its charge speed in the air also matches its charge speed on the ground, similar to the Squiffer.

This allows the weapon to jump repeatedly to avoid enemy fire without a charge speed penalty.\n\n- It can hold its charge, allowing it to quickly move around into better positions.\n\nThe REEF-LUX has three different options of fire that best suit different situations.\n\n- Tap shots are used to paint the map and charge the special meter.\n\n- Partial charges are used for close range enemies for swift splats.\n\n- Full charges are used for sniping from longer ranges.\n\nCurling Bomb can be used for multiple different things.\n\n- Curling Bomb can help the REEF-LUX move around, as its fully charged shot does not paint a straight line.\n\n- Charging up the Curling Bomb can leave a trap for opponents pursuing the REEF-LUX.\n\n- Charging up a Curling Bomb can also help splat any enemies hiding below a ledge.\n\n- Sending a stray Curling Bomb into enemy turf can distract them while you can approach them from a different angle.\n\nThe Tenta Missiles have a few uses on the REEF-LUX.\n\n- Tenta Missiles can displace backlines that are targeting teammates.\n\n- Tenta Missiles can reveal the locations of enemies for your team.\n\n- The Tenta Missiles can distract opponents before entering battle. The REEF-LUX can then move in and splat opponents that are distracted by the incoming missiles.\n\n- As a slayer, this weapon does well with backup from frontline slayers and/or supporting fire from other support weapons, as this weapon is not as independent as others.\n\n- In Tacticooler comps, the REEF-LUX does well. Tacticooler's effects increase the mobility of the REEF-LUX further. Tacticooler's Special Saver can be good to preserve REEF-LUX's Tenta Missiles after its splatted, and its Quick Respawn can help REEF-LUX get back quickly after its splatted when on the battlefield.\n\n- As it has Tenta Missiles, it can help backliners on its team such as the Heavy Splatling and Splat Charger by taking care of enemy backliners.\n\n- The REEF-LUX takes time to charge its bullets, so weapons that can rush it down before it can charge them-such as the Splash-o-matic-can take care of REEF-LUX users with some ease.\n\n- The REEF-LUX's bullets have slight diffusion, so weapons with high mobility that can avoid its one-shot such as the Dark Tetra Dualies can avoid getting splatted.\n\n- The REEF-LUX also has a shorter range compared to some other slayers, so zoning it out with weapons such as the Splatana Stamper can splat it while being safe from its fast-charging snipes.\n\nThis is a list of abilities that are generally good for the REEF-LUX.\n\nOpening Gambit is good for the REEF-LUX because of its ability to swiftly splat opponents. Since its bullets diffuse and have a good chance to hit an opponent, it can also assist teammates in splatting opponents to keep the ability going. The effects of the ability are very useful, too. It increases movement speed, which the REEF-LUX can utilize well.\n\nSpecial Charge Up is also popular because of the REEF-LUX's ability to spam Tenta Missiles. Getting Tenta Missiles faster and more often will help it be more supportive.\n\nSwim Speed Up helps the REEF-LUX be more mobile. Swim Speed Up helps it get to places quicker and makes it more unpredictable while fighting, because it can hold a charge.\n\nIf the player decides to play REEF-LUX aggressively, Quick Respawn can help the REEF-LUX respawn quicker and have less downtime after being splatted.\n\nQuick Super Jump can help the player get back in the game quicker after respawning and escape quicker when being pursued.\n\nWhen playing aggressively, Special Saver decreases the amount of special lost after respawning. This works well because the REEF-LUX can get splatted a lot, and can help the player regain the special charge they had before getting splatted.\n\nComeback increases the mobility of the REEF-LUX for a short time after spawning. As stated earlier, extra mobility can help the REEF-LUX a lot. And if playing aggressive, the REEF-LUX can get splatted a lot.\n\nSpecial Power Up can help the REEF-LUX as a support weapon. Special Power Up increases the radius of the Tenta Missile's lock-on reticle, increasing the chance that it locks onto multiple enemies that are spread out. It also increases the paint coverage of the Tenta Missiles, allowing for more control over enemy turf.\n\nThe REEF-LUX does not paint the player's feet well and is vulnerable while charging, so stepping in enemy ink is nearly unavoidable in fights. Ink Resistance Up helps the REEF-LUX retain some of its mobility while fighting and decreases the rate at which the player takes damage in enemy ink.\n\nIn the beginning of Splatoon 3, REEF-LUX was considered good, solely due to its ability to spam Tenta Missiles. However, after the Tenta Missiles received a nerf that reduced the capability of weapons to spam it, the REEF-LUX became unviable. Even after the REEF-LUX received a buff that somewhat fixed one of its greatest weaknesses, its weapon kit was still considered bad for it.\n\nCurrently, the REEF-LUX does not see much competitive use aside from a few players. It is most commonly used in Splat Zones due to its high turfing ability. The REEF-LUX has also seen use in tournaments where Turf War is used for bracket seeding, such as in the Splatoon 3 North American Championship 2023."
