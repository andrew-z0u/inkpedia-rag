    "The Annaki Splattershot Nova is a mid-range supportive weapon with very high paint off-put by low damage and slow kill times. While it has a more lethal kit than its predecessor, its greatest strength is using its kit to control the battlefield, continuing to encourage a supportive playstyle.",
    "- The weapon's range is ~14.5 units.",
    "- The weapon has good ink efficiency at 0.96% per shot with a great fire rate.",
    "- The weapon will primarily play around obtaining an Inkjet for its teammates.",
    "The Nova struggles with offensive tasks due to its low damage and low accuracy, making its kill time vary from good enough to very slow, which is something that is not generally the case for the Shooter class.",
    "The Splattershot Nova main weapon struggles with protecting itself, and the user should not engage with melee targets within most of its range, as its kill time and low reliability cannot guarantee that it will out damage at most distances. It can generally hold off when it has its range or a good position. It is ill-advised to take a fight with other weapons with high mobility such as the Splattershot and Splatana Wiper, as in most positions the paint output of the Splattershot Nova can be somewhat ignored.",
    "Your goal should be to survive as a supportive weapon, but holding off against other weapons can give a good charge to your special gauge, just make sure to hold wise and well-defended positions.",
    "Inkjet, despite being less favorable compared to other specials, is still a pretty decent pick. However, even though it has Inkjet, it should not be played like other Inkjet weapons. Instead, you should focusing on turfing for your team, which fills your special gauge, and then using Inkjet to pressure and possibly take out opponents.",
    "- Ink Mines are notoriously weak on most weapons, and the Annaki Splattershot Nova does not necessarily stray from this. However, due to its special, it can leave Ink Mines down by its Inkjet recall point and help prevent the enemy camping your jump by possibly marking them for your teammates or yourself.",
    "- Inkjet replaces the not good main weapon with a offensive special weapon for a bit. Annaki Splattershot Nova  can get a lot of Inkjets, arguably the highest Inkjet output in the game, due to its good turfing.",
    "- High mobility weapons such as the Splattershot and Splatana Wiper do not mind the paint Splattershot Nova produces, and have a high chance of winning a fight against it. The weapon struggles with its slow time to splat, and this makes it unlikely to win any fight unless it is fighting with a teammate, has Inkjet, or is able to expertly use its range to its advantage.",
    "The Annaki Splattershot Nova tends to use 10AP or higher of Special Charge Up, because Inkjet makes the weapon work. It tends to run 7AP or higher of Special Power Up, this helps Inkjet get more splats. With 5AP of Run Speed Up, combined with the weapon's 10% run speed increase while firing from 3.1.0, makes it hard to pin down the Nova unless up close, and helps with strafing in general. 5AP of Swim Speed Up can pair nicely with that, as Shooters tend to go between firing and swimming quickly. Utility subs are encouraged.",
    "According to sendou.ink, 52.77% of recorded builds run Drop Roller, a common ability which helps with getting the jump on enemies camping your Inkjet recall point. Some other decently common Primary Abilities are Last-Ditch Effort, and Stealth Jump.",
