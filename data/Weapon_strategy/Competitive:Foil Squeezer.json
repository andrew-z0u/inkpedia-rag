    "Like the Squeezer, the Foil Squeezer has two modes of fire: a powerful, long-ranged, semiautomatic mode and a short-ranged, fully automatic mode intended for turfing. While it takes a good amount of practice to get used to its mechanics, its user will be rewarded with the ability to quickly splat opponents from afar. Unlike the Vanilla variant, this weapon has a more versatile kit, providing its user the means to either poke at their opponents or push their way back into a contested area.",
    "The Foil Squeezer's has traits of both a slayer and support weapon:",
    "The Foil Squeezer has two main weaknesses: low ink efficiency and slow firing rate:",
    "The Splat Bomb is a powerful, versatile sub weapon with a variety of purposes suited for any player:",
    "The Bubble Blower can launch up to three bubbles, which have a number of applications if used wisely:",
    "The Foil Squeezer's perfect accuracy, high DPS, and long range allow its user to maintain pressure, provide support fire, and quickly splat opponents from afar. However, its slow firing rate and poor ink efficiency leave its user vulnerable at close range. Therefore, it is generally advised not to add more than one other long-ranged weapon to a team composition for a few reasons:[12]",
    "While the Foil Squeezer is not particularly poor at turfing, it is still outclassed in this role by traditional support weapons, such as the N-ZAP '85 or the Splattershot Jr.. A team whose composition lacks sufficient turfing ability will struggle to maintain map control, which can make games seem like a constant uphill battle:[12]",
    "Due to its aforementioned strengths and weaknesses, a Foil Squeezer user would both complement and be complemented by any teammate using an ink efficient, rapid-firing weapon:[13]",
    "Bubble Blower is great for either initiating a push into contested territory or repelling the opponents' push. However, it is neither a very reliable means of turfing territory – such as a Splat Zone – nor always a dependable means to splat opponents — particularly ones with longer-ranged weapons. Therefore, it would be redundant to have two Bubble Blower users in a team composition:[12]",
    "Besides providing protection while pushing the objective, the Bubble Blower works well in conjunction with other special weapons:",
    "Remember, teammates of a Bubble Blower user can assist by either keeping the bubbles inflated or bursting them, thanks to their 20% bonus damage inflicted on them:",
    "Gear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.",
    "Ever since its introduction in version 4.3.0, Bomb Defense Up DX will not only reduce the damage taken from opposing sub and special weapons that are not one-hit-splat but will also reduce the duration of the tracking effects of certain opponent's sub and special weapons, such as Point Sensors and Ink Mines, allowing the user of this ability to evade detection more easily. While this is a useful ability for any player, a Foil Squeezer user – who is often a target of their opponents' bombs and Tenta Missiles to counter their Bubble Blower – would definitely want it as part of their gear. Just three ability points, or one sub, offer plenty of utility:[15][16][17][18]",
    "While a Foil Squeezer user generally remains a further distance from their opponents then do users of most other weapons, they can still expect to come in contact with the opponent's ink on various surfaces – usually from opposing bombs and Tenta Missiles – which can both be damaging and reduce mobility. Ink Resistance Up not only partially offsets the reduction in mobility but also delays the damage taken from contact with opposing ink.[16][17][18]",
    "[19]",
    "The low ink efficiency of the Foil Squeezer limits the opportunities its user can use Splat Bombs. Ink Saver (Sub) reduces the ink consumption per Splat Bomb, which enables its user to throw Splat Bombs more often and conserves ink for the main weapon.[17]",
    "Last-Ditch Effort is a headgear-exclusive ability that, under specific conditions, grants its user 1 to 24 ability points each of the following abilities:",
    "These abilities only begin to take effect under either of the following conditions:",
    "Because they have both an ink-thirsty main weapon and a spammable sub weapon, a Foil Squeezer user stands to greatly benefit from both the overall reduced ink consumption and increased ink recovery,[17][20] making Last-Ditch Effort used in over 54% of 602 Foil Squeezer builds submitted to Sendou.ink.[21]",
    "An ability exclusive to shoes, Object Shredder provides a Foil Squeezer user three specific benefits:[17][22]",
    "These benefits, particularly the former, are likely the reason why over 96% of of 602 Foil Squeezer builds submitted to Sendou.ink include Object Shredder.[21]",
    "Quick Super Jump decreases both the \"charge\" time before and the travel time of a Super Jump, helping its user escape unfavorable situations more quickly. While a Foil Squeezer player matches up well in most one-on-one battles, there will be situations in which quickly retreating and preserving precious special gauge progress would be wiser than risking getting splatted.[16][17][18]",
    "Special Charge Up accelerates building up the special gauge for Bubble Blower. Since versions 5.2.0 and 5.5.0 have increased the special gauge requirement for the Foil Squeezer's Bubble Blower, the value of this gear ability has increased, as it allows a Foil Squeezer user to more readily have Bubble Blower available to initiate pushes and counter-pushes against the opponent.[17]",
    "Special Power Up increases bubbles' size upon launching as well as their blast radius. The former trait enables bubbles to withstand more damage from the opponents before defusing, providing their user and their teammates a longer duration of protection.[17] Foil Squeezer builds submitted to Sendou.ink tend to have 9-19 ability points of Special Power Up.[21]",
    "While Swim Speed Up can enable a short-ranged weapon user to close the distance towards their opponents, conversely, it can also help a Foil Squeezer user to maintain a safe distance from their opponents or escape unfavorable situations, as well as more quickly respond to an opponents' push.[17]",
    "[21][23]",
    "The Foil Squeezer upon release would not be as strong. The main weapon itself was not as strong so the weapon was not used quite often. The weapon would be ranked moderately high by competitive player Sorin because of the weapon's potential.[24] However at Version 4.0.0 the weapon would drop.[25] The weapon at version 4.6.0 would be ranked at a similar spot than before. The weapon itself while in the same tier, is considered better than the Forge Splattershot Pro because of its slightly better range and being less gear dependent.[26]",
    "However, once at version 5.3.0, the Foil Squeezer would start to be on the rise. The weapon would be placed very high and could be considered \"a top three weapon\". The weapon has more range the Splattershot Pro and can instapop bubbles constantly, meaning the weapon is very deadly.[27] Once at version 5.4.0 the weapon would drop slightly as it would not be as strong as it was before. The weapon would still be strong, but more counters to the weapon had developed, meaning the weapon would not be as efficient as it was before.[28] Now at version 5.5.0, the weapon is considered to be, along with the Kensa .52 Gal, the best weapons in the game as they define the meta and, thus, which other weapons are used.[3]",
    "- Its semiautomatic mode (tapping ) has a long range (187.39 DU) that exceeds that of all other slayer weapons, most other support weapons, and even some anchor's weapons, such as the H-3 Nozzlenose D, the Dualie Squelchers (both 160.396 DU),[5] and the Nautilus 79 (165 DU).\nIt also has perfect accuracy – even while airborne – to enable its user to fire even further and higher by jumping, allowing them to more easily zone out their opponents.\nIts high damage (38 HP), combined with the aforementioned range and accuracy, helps splat most opponents before they can get too close.\nHowever, the semiautomatic mode requires its user to have a rapid trigger finger, more accuracy than with an automatic shooter, and the ability to lead their shots in order to compensate for both its longer range and slightly slower shot velocity (32 DU/f versus the Splattershot Pro's 38.33 DU/f).[2]",
    "- In contrast, the fully automatic mode (holding ) has a short range (118.064 DU), a wide shot spread (8 degrees deviation on the ground, 13 degrees in midair), and a mediocre firing rate (7 frames between shots), making it no better than either a Splattershot or an N-ZAP '85 (both 116.99 DU, 6-12 degrees, 5-6 frames).[5] Use this mode primarily for turfing and farming Bubble Blower.",

    "- Its ink efficiency in semiautomatic mode (2.2%) is worse than that of the Splattershot Pro (2.0%). This will also limit your opportunities to use Splat Bombs. Always check the ink tank and avoid getting caught in the middle of opposing ink.",
    "- Its slow firing rate (7-8 frames) can be exploited by opponents using quicker firing weapons when they get too close. Therefore, keep your opponents at a safe distance, look out for flankers and be wary of any sharks lurking in opposing ink.",
    "- It can be used for poking at and zoning out opponents during the neutral phase, stalling an opponent's push, or denying opponents safe access to important areas of the stage, such as the Tower, that might not be easy to fire at with the main weapon.",
    "- Carefully lobbing a Splat Bomb at an opposing anchor positioned on their snipe will hinder their ability to control space with their range.",
    "- If a shorter-ranged opponent gets too close, either dropping a Splat Bomb at your feet or rolling it like a bowling ball can provide time and space to escape.",
    "- A Splat Bomb can damage or destroy an opponent's brella shield, Splash Wall, or Baller or the Rainmaker shield, while detonating on contact.\nAny opponents caught within the Splat Bomb's explosion will get damaged or splatted.[6]\nIt will also inflate or pop a teammate's bubbles but deflate or diffuse an opponent's bubbles, while still detonating on contact (see below).",
    "- An opponent's Splashdown, Booyah Bomb, or Ultra Stamp will defuse any Splat Bombs it touches, so hold off using them until after their special weapon finishes.",

    "- While the main weapon cannot be used, sub weapons can still be used, allowing one to instapop their bubbles (see below).",
    "- Bubble canceling will cancel its end lag, allowing you to both reduce vulnerability time and launch bubbles more quickly.[7][8]",
    "- Since version 5.2.0, each successive bubble is larger than the previous one.",
    "- Upon being blown, a bubble will either inflate and eventually burst when hit with your team's weapons or deflate and diffuse when hit with your opponents' weapons:\nPlayers will inflict 20% more damage to their team's bubbles than will their opponents. As long as you are not outnumbered, you should be able to inflate or sustain your team's bubbles more easily than your opponents can defuse them.\nBombs are a particularly quick means to inflate your team's bubbles. Any bombs and blaster shots that come in contact with bubbles will also instantly detonate, potentially splatting their respective user's opponents.[7][8][9] Thus, be aware of your teammates' and opponents' positions whenever using Bubble Blower.",
    "- Blowing bubbles can protect their user and any teammates from incoming opposing fire whether during a push or while stalling an opposing push.[10]",
    "- The Foil Squeezer is one of a few weapons to have both Bubble Blower and throwable bombs in its kit, enabling its user to instapop their bubbles – with both Object Shredder and enough ability points of Special Power Up – to push into a contested area:[2][7][8][11]\nRoll a Splat Bomb slowly toward the opponent or contested area.\nActivate Bubble Blower and launch a bubble or two toward the Splat Bomb, which will detonate and enlarge the bubble(s).\nRemembering that activating any special instantly reloads the ink tank, throw a second Splat Bomb towards the bubble(s) to pop it/them.\nLaunch any remaining bubbles to push the opponent further back.",

    "- A team with too many long-ranged weapons will have fewer mobile weapons that can quickly capture turf and wrest control of the objective, hindering its ability to begin an effective push into the opponents' territory. Such a team will also have difficulty breaking out of an opponent's spawn camp.",
    "- Longer-ranged weapons, such as the Foil Squeezer, are generally less effective at close range, so a team with too many of them is more prone to getting flanked and sharked than usual.",
    "- A team whose composition lacks enough turfing ability can be rendered immobile if the other team dominates map control.",
    "- A lack of turfing also makes it difficult to alter the course of a game, even after wiping out the other team.",
    "- A teammate with a mobile, quick-turfing slayer's weapon – such as the Neo Splash-o-matic, the Kensa Splattershot, or the L-3 Nozzlenose D – can turf and confront opponents at closer range, while the Foil Squeezer user provides support fire from a safe distance.",
    "- Conversely, the user of a support weapon – such as a Splattershot Jr., an N-ZAP '85, or a Kensa Splattershot – can help turf the area around a Foil Squeezer user while still having enough ink to provide support fire with bombs.",
    "- Bomb Launcher and Booyah Bomb are more reliable means of turfing territory.",
    "- Other special weapons, such as Inkjet or Sting Ray, are intended for splatting opponents and more capable at this than is Bubble Blower.",
    "- During a push or counter-push, bubbles provide an extra layer of protection for a team already using Ink Armor.",
    "- Bubbles can provide cover for a teammate using certain mobile special weapons, such as a Baller.[14]",
    "- Players who have Bubble Blower but no bombs in their kit will likely need more help sustaining their bubbles than those who have both Bubble Blower and a bomb.",
    "- A well-placed Ink Storm can help sustain bubbles before eventually bursting them in an explosion of ink, pushing the opponents back.",
    "- The Foil Squeezer's long range, perfect accuracy, and high damage all make its user difficult for most opponents to challenge in a straight one-on-one matchup. Therefore, users of most other weapons have to rely other means to defeat an opposing Foil Squeezer user:\nWhen using a shorter-ranged weapon, flank, shark, or outmaneuver (e.g., via dodge rolling) the opposing Foil Squeezer user to exploit their slow firing rate.\nA Splash Wall (such as from a Kensa .52 Gal user), a Splat Brella, or a Tenta Brella can limit the range of a slow-firing opposing Foil Squeezer user.\nWhen attacking with bombs, try to throw them behind the opposing Foil Squeezer user to force them closer.\nTry to exploit the opposing Foil Squeezer's poor ink efficiency by containing them with friendly ink, using sub weapons and teammates whenever possible.\nMost chargers, some splatlings, the Custom Jet Squelcher, the Bloblobber, and the Explosher all outrange the Foil Squeezer, allowing their users to fire upon an opposing Foil Squeezer user with impunity — as long as they keep their opponent at bay.",
