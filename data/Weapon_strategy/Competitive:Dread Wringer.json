    "The Dread Wringer is a middleweight weapon which can splat enemies somewhat inconsistently, with three sloshes of ink needed to splat players, and sloshing twice every shot.",
    "Gear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.",
    "Ink Saver (Main) is a great ability that can help the player attack enemies more, especially when it does not have any space to breathe.",
    "When throwing a Suction Bomb, the Dread Wringer only gets 3 shots. Ink Saver (Sub) will help with managing your ink tank.",
    "Ink Recovery Up is a useful ability that can be used alongside with Ink Saver (Main), as it helps the Dread Wringer recover its ink faster during the weapon's downtime.",
    "Dread Wringer is a slow and aggressive weapon, meaning that it will probably be splatted more often. Special Saver can help it have Reefslider anytime its needed.",
    "As mentioned before, the Dread Wringer is a slow weapon, so abilities like Swim Speed Up would help it fight or flee in battle.",
    "Special Power Up increases the paint and damage radius of Reefslider. In Splat Zones, this can be used to instantly take control of smaller Splat Zones. Despite the user most likely getting splatted after using Reefslider, this can be used to prevent an early knockout or losing the lead by resetting the opponent's penalty.",

    "- Getting both sloshes on an opponent will leave them weakened to the point where almost any attack from your team can splat them.\nThe weapon can also easily finish off damaged opponents (who took more than 10.0 points of damage) with both sloshes.",
    "- It can be great in areas with lots of turf painted in its own color, as that can help with its poor mobility.\nPaired with its decent turfing capabilities for its speed makes it take space quicker than other weapons as slow as it.",

    "- Paired with its decent turfing capabilities for its speed makes it take space quicker than other weapons as slow as it.",
    "- Though it paints better than most other Sloshers, the Dread Wringer isn't the best at painting, yet needs space to move around in to maximize its ability to keep enemies out.\nGood painting weapons like the Jet Squelcher can paint the stage for the Dread Wringer.",
    "- Suction Bombs can help keep opponents at bay while the Dread Wringer inks the ground.",
    "- Reefslider's 70.0 splash damage can combo with Dread Wringer's 48.0 or 42.0 damage hit for a splat.\nIt can even combo with a 35.0 damage hit, the lowest possible damage that one of the Dread Wringer's sloshes can deal.",

    "- It can even combo with a 35.0 damage hit, the lowest possible damage that one of the Dread Wringer's sloshes can deal.",
    "- The Dread Wringer, while strong, fires slowly, making it vulnerable to be shot down by faster weapons, such as the Splattershot.",
    "- This slosher is rather slow, so Anchors such as the E-liter 4K can splat it from a distance without the Dread Wringer user swimming away too quickly.",
    "- If it ever tries to unleash its Reefslider, its opponents can rush it down after the explosion, as it could be way too vulnerable to defend itself. Reefslider is also vulnerable to lethal bombs after the explosion due to the endlag, so throwing a bomb at the user's feet can splat them.",
    "- The Dread Wringer is quite ink hungry as it can only shoot 11 times per ink tank. Depending on the main weapon, it may be a good idea to wait for the Dread Wringer to use a few sloshes, or its bomb, and then quickly rush it down."
