    "The Cherry H-3 Nozzlenose in Splatoon is considered one of the best weapons in the game. While Splash Wall may not be the best, the weapon's cheap Bubbler and losing only 40% of the Special gauge when getting splatted makes the weapon very strong.[1]",
    "- Its relatively high damage per shot (41 HP) guarantees a three-hit splat, or a one-burst splat, unless falloff damage is being used (minimum 20.5 HP).\nDamage Up can increase the damage per shot up to 49.9 HP of damage — nearly a two-hit splat.",
    "- Its medium range is close to that of the Splattershot Pro, the .96 Gal, and exceeds those of other typical slayer and support weapons, such as the Splattershot and the N-ZAP '85, allowing it to both zone them out and turf from a safer distance.",
    "- Because the maximum angle its shots – whether fired from the ground or while midair – can ever deviate is 1 degree, the Cherry H-3 Nozzlenose is one of the most accurate weapons in the game.",
    "The Cherry H-3 Nozzlenose is also a very capable support weapon because of its range and turf coverage:",
    "- Its ink coverage is very efficient for turfing, which helps maintain map control and quickly build up the special gauge.",
    "- Its range allows its wielder to safely provide support fire for teammates and poke at and zone out opponents during the neutral phase.",
    "As a burst-fire shooter, the Cherry H-3 Nozzlenose requires a higher level of skill than an automatic shooter to be effective:",
    "- Its user must be more accurate with aiming, due to the long delay between bursts.",
    "- A user of any burst-fire shooter has to be able to lead their shots in order to maximize the damage per burst.",
    "The primary weaknesses of the Cherry H-3 Nozzlenose are its poor ink efficiency, slow mobility while firing, and long lag between firing bursts:",
    "- Its ink consumption (1.6% per shot, 4.8% per burst) is worse than that of the Splattershot Pro (1.9%). Watch your ink tank and do not travel too deep into the opponent's turf.",
    "- While firing, its movement speed while firing (0.45 units per frame) is slower than most slayer weapons and most other support weapons, which, combined with the lag between firing, can leave it vulnerable to attack.",
    "- If either poorly aimed or mindlessly fired, its long lag between firing bursts is easy to punish at close range — especially by flankers and sharks.",
    "When placed properly, a Splash Wall can provide great utility, even in stages and areas that are more open:",
    "- Splash Walls allow the user to play more aggressively than the Splat Charger, but when the time comes, it can still play defensively.",
    "- Any bombs thrown by an opponent that hit a Splash Wall will instantly explode, potentially splatting the Splash Wall's user or their teammates.\nRefrain from either showering in or rushing through the wall until it is certain that the opponent has no bombs available in the area.\nDo not throw a Splash Wall behind a teammate, as an opponent's bomb thrown into the wall can instantly splat them.",
    "- Defensively, it can allow its user to evade a pursuing opponent or hinder the opponents' push, blocking both their movement and their fire.",
    "- Offensively, a Splash Wall can restrain the opponents' movement, allowing its user and their teammates to push forward or gain map control.",
    "- Throwing a Splash Wall behind an opponent can prevent them from fleeing.",
    "- In Splatoon, the Tower will go through a Splash Wall it collides into, forcing opponents to leave the tower.",
    "The Bubbler is a very useful special and can easily turn the tables of a battle:",
    "- The Bubbler will grant the user 4.5 seconds of invincibility, meaning to can be a great panic button if under fire.",
    "- While under the effect of the Bubbler, the user can attack enemies without worrying if they will get splatted, unless near water or an abyss.",
    "- Before the Bubbler runs out, the Bubbler will flash, indicating the user that the Bubbler will end soon. Use the remaining time to escape, as the Cherry H-3 Nozzlenose cannot fight back efficiently after it ends.",
    "- Bubbler can be shared with teammates by getting close to them. This can be useful to allow two players to be under the effect of Bubbler and push, or to save someone from getting splatted.",
    "- Although the Bubbler is invincible, its one weakness is the knockback it receives. Simply shooting at a Bubbler will either push or hold them back.\nBe careful of any bombs, as they will push the player back farther than with just the main weapon.\nUnlike Kraken, the Bubbler user still can use their main weapon, which they can use to attack the opponent or to escape.",
    "The Cherry H-3 Nozzlenose has good range and thorough turfing but is not very mobile while firing and is vulnerable up close due to its long lag in between firing bursts. Be sure to include some shorter-ranged weapons in the team composition. Otherwise, a team with too many longer-ranged weapons will have some glaring drawbacks:",
    "- The lack of mobility will make it difficult for such a team to mount a push.",
    "- The reduced ability to battle in close range will make the team vulnerable to a well-timed flank or a well-positioned shark.",
    "Therefore, the Cherry H-3 Nozzlenose makes a good complement to – and is well complemented by – a a more rapid firing slayer's or support weapon, such as a Splattershot, an N-ZAP '85, or a Splash-o-matic.",
    "While Splash Walls can protect a team, they cannot inflict lethal damage, making them less versatile than most bombs. Therefore, it is advised for at least one teammate of a Cherry H-3 Nozzlenose user to have lethal bombs in their kit. Splat or Suction Bombs provide its user's team many advantages over another team that has no lethal bombs in its composition:",
    "- Their one-hit-splat offers its user's team chances of instantly gaining a numbers advantage, from which a game-winning push can arise.",
    "- Their lethal explosion provides space for its user's team to either push into an area held by the opponent or stall an opponent's push.",
    "- The turf inked by the resulting explosion contributes to both maintaining map control and building up the special gauge.",
    "- The .96 Gal has the same range as the Cherry H-3 Nozzlenose but also has a lower special gauge requirement and less firing lag.",
    "- Mobile, quick firing weapons, such as the Splattershot, once within range, can exploit the Cherry H-3 Nozzlenose's slow mobility and long lag after firing.",
    "- Any long-ranged weapon, such as a charger or most splatlings, can fire upon a Cherry H-3 Nozzlenose with impunity. Some of these weapons even outmaneuver a Cherry H-3 Nozzlenose; however, do not allow one to get too close.",
    "- Keep an eye on a Cherry H-3 Nozzlenose user to see if they have Bubbler ready to use, and both watch and listen for when it is activated.\nThe best way to prevent the opponent from using Bubbler is to splat the opponent with the Cherry H-3 Nozzlenose (or any other Bubbler-equipped weapon). A charger or long-ranged splatling user can prioritize an opposing Cherry H-3 Nozzlenose user and exploit their low mobility during the long firing lag, or a slayer can attempt to pick off an unwary Cherry H-3 Nozzlenose.",
    "- Specials such as Killer Wail or Inkstrike, while they may not splat the opponent under the effect of Bubbler, can disrupt the movement of the opponent.",
    "- While situational, a counter Bubbler or Kraken can be used to force the Cherry H-3 Nozzlenose out of the area.",
    "Gear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.",
    "Damage Up increases the damage of the main and sub weapon. Damage Up can help with making the Cherry H-3 Nozzlenose close to a two-hit splat if the opponent has been damaged by ink. Damage Up can also negate Defense Up to guarantee a three-hit splat.",
    "While the weapon inks well, the user is expected to come into contact with enemy ink often. Ink Resistance Up helps with mobility while touching enemy ink, and the damage taken when stepping on it.",
    "Quick respawn allows this weapon to transition to more of a slayer weapon (the least mobile in the game). This will allow more splats with less penalty on death allowing for aggressive pushing for key positions.",
    "As Bubbler is extremely relevant to the survival and protection for the Cherry, some special charge should be considered for this weapon.",
    "[2]",
    "Unlike in Splatoon, the Cherry H-3 Nozzlenose is not used as often. While the weapon still has its strengths and a cheap Bubble Blower, the weapon takes too long to burst bubbles and does not have a bomb to help in popping them, making the weapon worse than the other variants.",
    "In Splatoon 2 the weapon has a few differences compared to in Splatoon:",
    "- Ink will be more likely to ink the user's feet than in the first game.",
    "- Shot accuracy while jumping is always set to 1 degree, equal to when on the ground, compared to 6 degrees after jumping in Splatoon.",
    "- The weapon inks a wall better than in the first game.",
    "- The ink cooldown after firing it set to 25 degrees instead of 30 degrees, meaning the user will wait a shorter time to refill their ink tank.",
    "- The weapon consumes 6.75% of the ink tank per burst, compared to 4.8% in Splatoon, making the weapon more ink hungry.",
    "- The range of the weapon is lower than it is in Splatoon, with shots traveling for 115 distance units than 132.",
    "Splash Wall also receives changes going from Splatoon to Splatoon 2.",
    "- Splash Wall can no longer splat a player near instantly if it activates on top of someone, only doing 30 damage every half second instead of 50 damage per frame.",
    "- A new Splash Wall can be thrown even if your old Splash Wall still exists on the stage. The old Splash Wall will disappear.",
    "- There are significantly less white ink frames after throwing a Splash Wall. Ink recovery will begin after roughly 1 second, instead of 2.67 seconds.",
    "- Showering is no longer possible due to the thinner hitbox.",
    "- A Splash Wall can nullify a brella shield — even a Tenta Brella shield.\nIf an opposing brella user launches their shield, dropping a Splash Wall in front of it will cause both to negate one another, potentially denying a Rainmaker or Power Clam push.\nAt maximum, it takes 36-41% of the ink tank to launch a brella shield and 60% to drop a Splash Wall. However, the Splash Wall can be deployed far more quickly, allowing its owner more time to reload ink or reposition themselves to a more favorable location.",
    "- In Splatoon 2, the Tower will destroy any Splash Wall it collides into, meaning that it can no longer be used to stall the movement of the Tower itself.[4]\nHowever, a Splash Wall can still be used to stall opponents pushing ahead of the Tower and limit the opponents' movement around the Tower path.\nConversely, a Splash Wall may be placed onto the Tower to protect its user or their teammate while riding it. (Once again, watch out for the opponents' bombs.)",
    "The Bubble Blower can launch up to three bubbles, which have a number of applications if used wisely:",
    "- A Bubble Blower user is vulnerable at close range. Create some distance from your opponents before activating Bubble Blower.",
    "- While the main weapon cannot be used, the sub can, allowing a Cherry H-3 Nozzlenose user to throw a Splash Wall to protect themselves while launching bubbles.",
    "- Since version 5.2.0, each successive bubble is larger than the previous one.\nSpecial Power Up not only increases the initial size of each bubble blown but also increases the size of their blast radius upon bursting.",
    "- Upon being blown, a bubble will either inflate and eventually burst when hit with your team's weapons or deflate and diffuse when hit with your opponents' weapons:\nBombs – either your team's or your opponents' – can respectively inflate or deflate your bubbles quickly. Any bombs that come in contact with bubbles will also instantly detonate, splatting their respective user's opponents.[5] Thus, be aware of your teammates' and opponents' positions whenever using Bubble Blower.\nObject Shredder increases damage dealt to bubbles – both friendly and opposing – by 30%, hastening either the growing or defusing of bubbles.",
    "- Blowing bubbles can protect their user and any teammates from incoming opposing fire whether during a push or while stalling an opposing push.[6]",
    "- To pop bubbles quicker, throw a Splash Wall and launch the Bubbles towards the Splash Wall. If popped instantly after launching, the Bubbles will take two bursts to pop instead of three.",
    "- This weapon is good in Tower Control. It can help with splatting opponents on the tower and the Bubble Blower can cover the tower causing opponents to retreat.",
    "Bubble Blower is great for either initiating a push into contested territory or repelling the opponents' push. However, it is neither a very reliable means of turfing territory – such as a Splat Zone – nor always a dependable means to splat opponents — particularly ones with longer-ranged weapons. Therefore, it would be redundant to have two Bubble Blower users in a team composition:[7]",
    "- Bomb Launcher and Booyah Bomb are more reliable means of turfing territory.",
    "- Other special weapons, such as Inkjet or Sting Ray, are intended for splatting opponents and more capable at this than is Bubble Blower.",
    "Besides providing protection while pushing the objective, the Bubble Blower works well in conjunction with other special weapons:",
    "- A well-placed Ink Storm can help sustain bubbles before eventually bursting them in an explosion of ink, pushing the opponents back.",
    "- Bubbles can provide cover for a teammate using certain mobile special weapons, such as a Baller.[8]",
    "- Keep an eye on the HUD to know when an opposing Cherry H-3 Nozzlenose user has Bubble Blower ready to use, and generally keep a safe distance from them when they do.\nPicking off an opponent using Bubble Blower too close will stop the production of bubbles outright.\nThe splash radius of a blaster-type weapon can damage opponents attempting to hide within their bubbles.[9]\nBombs are not only usually the most efficient way to defuse opposing bubbles, but they can also splat any opponents caught in their blasts.\nSplashdown and Ultra Stamp are usually the quickest means to destroy an opponent's bubbles. However, getting caught in the bubbles' explosions is very likely. The Booyah Bomb and an explosion from the Baller can be safer alternatives.\nTenta Missiles can both track opponents hiding underneath bubbles and destroy the bubbles.\nIf activated early enough, Ink Storm can quickly defuse any opponent's bubbles that travel underneath the cloud.",
    "Ever since its introduction in version 4.3.0, Bomb Defense Up DX will not only reduce the damage taken from opposing sub and special weapons that are not one-hit-splat but will also reduce the duration of the tracking effects of certain opponent's sub and special weapons, such as Point Sensors and Ink Mines, allowing the user of this ability to evade detection more easily. Being a slayer weapon, its user risks damage from both bombs and special weapons and can greatly benefit from reducing the damage taken from them. Just three ability points, or one sub, offer plenty of utility:[10][11]",
    "- The splash damage of most bombs is reduced from 30 HP to 28.6 HP. This reduction in damage provides two benefits:\nIt prevents its user from being exposed on their opponents' map by the splash damage of most single bombs.\nInk Armor will not break due to splash damage from a single bomb whose splash damage normally inflicts 30 HP of damage.",
    "- The splash damage of near-misses from either Tenta Missiles or Inkjet, the minimum splash damage of bubbles, and the collision damage from Baller are all reduced from 50 HP to 48.3 HP,[12] enabling one to survive two hits from any of these specific means of special weapon damage.",
    "A Cherry H-3 Nozzlenose user can expect to come in contact with the opponent's ink on various surfaces, which can both be damaging and reduce mobility - especially in between shots. Ink Resistance Up not only partially offsets the reduction in mobility but also delays the damage taken from contact with opposing ink.[10][11]",
    "- Just three ability points, or one sub,…\n…delays the damage taken from opposing ink by 10 frames.\n…reduces the damage taken from 0.3 HP/f (health points per frame) to 0.2 HP/f.\n…lowers the limit on the amount of damage opposing ink on surfaces can inflict from 40 HP to 38 HP.\n…increases the normal running speed in opposing ink from 0.24 DU/f to 0.33 DU/f.[13]\n…increases the jumping height in opposing ink from 0.8 to 0.854.[12]",
    "- Six ability points, or two subs,…\n…delays the damage taken from opposing ink by 15 frames.\n…reduces the damage taken to 0.2 HP/f.\n…lowers the damage limit of opposing ink to 36.2 HP.\n…increases the normal running speed in opposing ink to 0.39 DU/f.[13]\n…increases the jumping height in opposing ink to 0.888.[12]",
    "An ability exclusive to shoes, Object Shredder provides a Cherry H-3 Nozzlenose user three specific benefits:",
    "- It increases their damage dealt to bubbles – both friendly and opposing – by 30%, allowing for quicker growing and popping of bubbles.",
    "- It triples the amount of damage inflicted onto armored opponents, allowing a Cherry H-3 Nozzlenose to break an opponent's Ink Armor in one hit.",
    "- It enables them to pop the Rainmaker shield more quickly with either their main weapon or Suction Bombs, allowing their team to start or restart a push more quickly while gaining a large amount of turf control in the immediate area.",
    "Special Power Up increases bubbles' size upon launching as well as their blast radius. The former trait enables bubbles to withstand more damage from the opponents before defusing, providing their user and their teammates a longer duration of protection.",
    "- 19 ability points – one main and three subs – increases the bubbles' size by 18.78% and their explosion hitboxes by 39.71%."
