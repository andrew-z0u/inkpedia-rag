    "The Krak-On Splat Roller is a variant of the Splat Roller, and is, as the name suggests, a weapon from the Krak-On brand. This weapon can be used in multiple ways, but the roller has a different kit than its vanilla version. The weapon kit has a few disadvantages but overall evens out due to the more aggressive special weapon and the non-lethal sub weapon.",
    "Using this weapon as a Support player gives the weapon a chance to really help a team cover as much turf as possible.",
    "(To be added)",
    "- Using long-ranged, far-distance weapons like chargers and splatlings can effectively counteract an incoming onslaught from a user of this weapon. Splatlings are advantageous because of their range and firing rate and can stop the Krak-On Splat Roller at almost any position with more ease than a fast-moving shooter. Chargers can also use more meticulous aiming to get this weapon.",
    "- Weapons that have the Killer Wail can catch this weapon by surprise, especially when the roller is inking turf or hiding in ink. Provided that the special is in the vicinity of the roller, the user will have to move thus forcing it to reveal the location they were in.",
    "Gear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon.",
    "Using Squid Ninja gives the Krak-On Splat Roller an advantage at sharking due to the inability to see the player while swimming.",
    "- Additionally, using  Swim Speed Up helps for sneaky leverage while avoiding some of the speed loss consequences.",
    "This ability can improve the power of the roller, and help with the overall performance.",
    "For more efficient inking, using these in a gear set will help backline rollers get coverage.",
    "For a more aggressive play-style, such as a slayer, use these abilities to save the Kraken special for a powerful blow.",
    "For a lethal attack that provides leeway for the team to close in on the opposing players, using these abilities let the player repeatedly perform a flamboyant distraction. (Good for skirmishers)",
    "The Krak-On Splat Roller is the first variant of the Splat Roller. Thanks to its one-hit-splat potential, it is capable of splatting opponents as easily as a Splattershot can. However, its shorter range, slower rate of attack, and dependence on teammates to turf require its user to rely on a different playstyle than that of a typical Splattershot user.",
    "While the Krak-On Splat Roller is a slayer's weapon, it is used differently from other, more conventional slayer's weapons, such as a Splattershot or a Slosher.",
    "- In Splatoon 2, the Krak-On Splat Roller can be used in three different ways:\nTapping  while on the ground will swing the weapon horizontally, which flings a wide splash of ink. The horizontal swing is suitable for splatting opponents at close range and turfing areas that are slightly out of reach.\nTo swing horizontally while airborne, press  before pressing  to jump.\nTapping  while in mid-air after jumping will swing the weapon vertically, which flings a longer, narrower swath of ink. The vertical swing can poke at opponents who are either further back or up above and can turf lanes through which to potentially travel.\nHolding down  while tilting  will push the Krak-On Splat Roller along the ground, spreading ink along a wide area and damaging any opponents hit by it.\nWhile this is a thorough means of turfing, it is also slower than swimming (1.32 DU/f, or distance units per frame, versus 1.92 DU/f). For this reason, it is also not recommended to rely mainly on rolling to splat opponents.",
    "- The damage inflicted by either the horizontal or vertical swing of any roller, including the Krak-On Splat Roller depends on (1) which roller is being used, (2) the amount of Main Power Up equipped, and (3) the distance between the roller wielder and their target — the closer the target is, the more damage it will take.",
    "- Both the horizontal and vertical swings of each roller has three ranges: the lethal range, or the maximum range at which at least 100 HP of damage is inflicted; the two-hit range, which is the maximum range at which at least 50 HP of damage is delivered; and the maximum range, the absolute maximum range at which the roller can deal any damage.\nWith no Main Power Up equipped, the Krak-On Splat Roller's horizontal swing has…\n…a lethal range of 80 DU, or slightly more than 1.5 distance lines away in the test range. This range is shorter than that of most other short-ranged weapons, such as both the Splattershot and the N-ZAP '85 (116.99 DU), the Splash-o-matic (110.03 DU), and even the Splattershot Jr. (103.89 DU).[1]\n…a two-hit range of about 100 DU, which is still shorter than the ranges of the other weapons listed above.\n…a maximum range of about 110 DU, at which a minimum damage of 35 HP is inflicted.\nInk flung from an angle greater than 30 degrees to either the left or right will lose damage starting from 28 DU and reach its minimum value at 100 DU. Therefore, aiming is still important when using the Splat Roller.\nDamage will suffer falloff to as little as 17.5 HP if the flung ink falls below the Splat Roller wielder. Thus, targets who are below a Krak-On Splat Roller user will take less damage than those either above or on the same level.\nLikewise, the Krak-On Splat Roller's vertical swing with no Main Power Up has…\n…a lethal range of 90 DU, or just shy of two distance lines away in the Shooting Range.\n…a two-hit range of about 120 DU, which is shorter than that of the .52 Gal (124.944 DU) and the Dark Tetra Dualies (132.5 DU).[1]\n…a maximum range of 155 DU – comparable to that of the Mini Splatling (130.1-154.1 DU),[1] at which the minimum damage is 40 HP.\nDamage will suffer falloff to as little as 20 HP if the flung ink falls below the Krak-On Splat Roller user. Because a vertical swing requires a roller user to be in mid-air after jumping, falloff tends to affect the vertical swing more often than it affects the horizontal swing.",
    "- Because of its overall short range, slower fire rate than a shooter, and specific style of attacks, a Krak-On Splat Roller user cannot expect to rush their opponents head-on and not get punished. Therefore, they will need to rely on both flanking and sharking more than a Splattershot user would.\nThe most ideal position a Krak-On Splat Roller user can shark around is often just below the opponents' perch, where the Krak-On Splat Roller user can hide, splat opponents who either drop down or get too close to the ledge, and poke at opponents atop the perch.\nWhile splatting an opponent or two is ideal during a flank attack, the player's main objective as a Krak-On Splat Roller user flanking the opponent is to divert the opponents' collective attention away from the objective (e.g. the Splat Zone or the Tower and the player's teammates for as long as possible. Avoid getting splatted by hiding either within friendly ink or behind or underneath obstacles, such as a bumper, and ambush any opponents who fall within the Krak-On's range.",
    "The Krak-On Splat Roller has the Squid Beakon as the sub. While not useful for attacking, the Squid Beakon has many uses:",
    "- The main purpose of the Squid Beakon is to provide a place for teammates and the player to Super Jump to. Place Squid Beakons in hidden places as the enemy team can destroy the Beakon by shooting at it.",
    "- The Squid Beakon can also be used as a temporary shield. If under fire, place a Squid Beakon and the shots will be blocked until the Beakon breaks",
    "The Baller is a versatile special weapon with a variety of uses:",
    "- Taking control of a certain area of the stage, such as a Splat Zone or underneath the opponents' Clam basket.\nForcing the opponents to clear an area, whether leading a Tower or Rainmaker push or stopping one.\nProviding its user an extra layer of protection, such as when fleeing an unsafe situation or while riding the Tower at a checkpoint. In the latter case, be wary of getting knocked off of the Tower by the opponents' weapons.\nAfter the Baller's explosion, nearby opponents not splatted are often damaged enough for one or two hits from either the main or sub weapon to splat them.\nBaller can be used to survive a Splashdown, although the Baller is instantly destroyed.",
    "- The lack of range of the Krak-On Splat Roller prevents its wielder from effectively engaging opponents head-on. Therefore, the other three members of their team will each have to use weapons with enough range to contest and preoccupy opponents so that the Splat Roller user can catch them by surprise.",
    "- While Ink Armor can support almost any teammate, it will make players affected by it more visible within their ink. If a teammate has a build that includes Ink Armor, pay attention to the HUD to know when to expect an Ink Armor. Then, when the teammate activates it, play more aggressively than stealthily. Once the Ink Armor has ether worn off or been broken, revert to sharking tactics.",
    "- Any weapon with an effective range longer than the lethal range of the Krak-On Splat Roller can counter an opposing Krak-On Splat Roller wielder who attempts to challenge opponents head-on. However, most Krak-On Splat Roller users worth their salt will rely more on flanking and sharking, so anyone facing a team with an opposing Krak-On Splat Roller wielder must take a few proactive measures to avoid getting flanked or sharked:\nKeep track of all four members of the opposing team – which ones are present, which ones are splatted, and which ones are back at their spawn point.\nCheck the map periodically for opposing ink forming around flanks to anticipate a flanking attack.\nTo prevent sharking, check suspicious puddles of the opponents' ink, preferably with a thrown sub weapon.\nWeapons that track opponents, such as Point Sensors, temporarily prevent an opponent from sharking and makes them an easier target for long-ranged teammates to pick off.\nTry to confront an opposing Krak-On Splat Roller user in a more open area to have more space to avoid the lethal range of the Splat Roller.",
    "- Keep an eye on the HUD to know when an opposing Krak-On Splat Roller user has Baller ready to avoid getting caught by surprise:\nIf an opposing Krak-On Splat Roller user activates a Baller in an unsafe position, it can be canceled quite easily from fast-firing weapons and chargers.\nThe opposing Krak-On Splat Roller user might go for risky plays if they know they have the Baller ready as a safety net. It is possible to bait them to take control of an open space and surprise them with a teammate to force a mid-Baller situation and cancel it.",
    "Gear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.",
    "As a short-range slayer's weapon, the Krak-On Splat Roller requires its user to be in close quarters with the opponent, who might be inclined to use bombs for zoning out the Krak-On Splat Roller user. Ever since its introduction in version 4.3.0, Bomb Defense Up DX will not only reduce the damage taken from opposing sub and special weapons that are not one-hit-splat but will also reduce the duration of the tracking effects of certain opponent's sub and special weapons, such as Point Sensors and Ink Mines, allowing the user of this ability to evade detection more easily.",
    "- 3 ability points - one sub - has a lot of utility. This includes, but is not limited to:\nInk Armor will not break due to splash damage from bombs and other explosives that do 30 damage.\nTwo near-misses from Inkjet, two bumps from a Baller, and splash damage from two bubbles from Bubble Blower will not splat the user.\nGetting hit by splash damage from a bomb will not make the user visible on the map.",
    "As a short-ranged weapon that excels at flanking, the Krak-On Splat Roller greatly benefits if it is able to swim faster. Swim Speed Up enables its user to more quickly close the distance towards an opponent, more quickly respond to an opponents' push, or even escape unfavorable situations.",
    "- Swim Speed Up can reduce the swim speed penalty from Ninja Squid. However, it takes at least 20 ability points – two mains – of Swim Speed Up to fully offset the swimming speed penalty of Ninja Squid.",
    "- Therefore, a Krak-On Splat Roller user with Ninja Squid will have to decide between either having fewer ability points available for other abilities or swimming at less than the base maximum speed. For example, just 10 ability points – one main – are enough to restore the swim speed of a Krak-On Splat Roller user with Ninja Squid to 1.83 units per frame.",
    "Ninja Squid reduces detection by opponents while swimming on non-vertical surfaces. It allows its user to swim at full speed undetected at the cost of about 20% of the maximum swimming speed as of version 3.0.0. Because a Krak-On Splat Roller user has difficulty attacking most opponents head-on, Ninja Squid can make it easier for its user to shark and more safely approach opponents.",
    "- As of version 3.0.0, Ninja Squid reduces the maximum swim speed of the Krak-On Splat Roller from 1.92 units per frame to 1.73 units per frame.",
    "Quick Respawn shortens respawn time after getting splatted (under specific conditions), encouraging a Krak-On Splat Roller user to remain aggressive even after getting splatted.",
    "- 26 ability points – two mains and two subs – are enough to reduce the respawn time from 8.5 seconds to 5.8 seconds.",
    "- When pressing , the player will bring down their weapon, either in a horizontal or vertical fling.\nWhen pressing  while in mid-air after jumping or performing a Squid Roll or Squid Surge, the player brings down their weapon in a vertical fling.\nWhen walking and pressing , the player brings down their weapon in a horizontal fling.",
    "- The Krak-On Splat Roller is one of the easier to handle weapons. The flings are faster than a Dynamo Roller's but slower than a Carbon Roller.",
    "- The Krak-On Splat Roller can roll over players, though it is most effective attack is bringing down their weapon, this allows players to avoid extreme close ranged combat.",
    "- Due to its ability to splat enemies in one hit and its aggressive special, it is an effective slayer.",
    "- Because of its high damage and short lethal range, sharking can be a useful strategy to employ.",
    "- While the Beakon is not a sub that is used actively in combat, it can be used to quickly get back into the fight if splatted.",
    "- The Kraken can cause pressure, pushing the enemy team back.",
    "- Flanking can take the enemy by surprise and negate long ranged weapons.",
    "- The Krak-On Roller's Kraken can allow the user to get close to back liners without endangering themselves. It can distract those back liners as well, allowing the Krak-On's teammates to push.",
    "The Krak-On Roller is one of the rollers which averages most of its skills. The Krak-On Roller's ink speed and handling are average. However, the range of the Krak-On Roller is low; forcing users to engage in close contact to splat anyone.",
    "- Weapons with range pair well with this weapon; enough so that the Krak-On Roller can take opponents by surprise while distracted by the long ranged weapons.",
    "- Because the Kraken is invincible, the player could invade the enemies' base and place a Squid Beakon to allow teammates access to the enemies' base.",
    "In Tower Control, just like any other roller, the Krak-On Roller can horizontal fling to kill any hiding enemies on the tower; if super jumping, the roller can also horizontal fling to kill anyone camping the super jump.",
    "- The Squid Beakon can be placed in hidden spots to super jump to the Tower to overtake it.",
    "- Weapons with an effective range longer than the Krak-On's lethal range can defeat them head on; however, experienced users often prefer to flank and shark. There are several ways to counter this:\nInking potentially dangerous areas carefully can flush a sharking Krak-On out.\nSubs such as Autobomb or Point Sensor can catch a Krak-On.\nLikewise, Wave Breaker can force the Krak-On out of a hiding spot.\nChecking the map for areas near the edges of the stage that are being inked by an enemy can point to flanking.\nLong Ranged weapons such as Jet Squelcher can over power a Krak-On Roller from a safe distance.\nTo avoid the Kraken Royale, a player could stand in unreachable areas or on grates where Krak-On Rollers cannot reach while in Kraken or Squid form.",
    "- Special abilities can help the Krak-On Splat Roller push with their special, the Kraken Royale. The following abilities can make the push more threatening and faster.",
    "- If the player is splatted they can charge Kraken Royale faster.",
    "- Special Power Up",
    "- Quick Respawn can help the player get back into the action faster, especially if a Squid Beakon was placed before death, or if a teammate is close to the objective.",
    "- Paired with Quick Respawn, a player can super jump to a Squid Beakon or teammate to get back into the battle even faster. Quick Super Jump can also be useful if the player is in danger.",
    "- Because the Squid Beakon takes up 75% of the player's ink, Ink Saver (Sub) can reduce the amount of ink used, allowing more ink to be used for attacking or fighting.",
    "- Due to the Krak-On's high ink consumption, Ink Saver (Main) can be useful to avoid running out of ink in a bad situation.",
    "- Stealth Jump can prove useful as to ambush enemies as well as being able to jump to teammates safely and not waste ink on placing Squid Beakons; Squid Beakons take a large sum of the player's ink, which could be used for attacking or turfing.",
    "- Ninja Squid can be a useful ability to have in order to shark enemies and flank, two of the best strategies to use as a Krak-On",
    "- Swim Speed Up can be useful for moving around the map quickly, increasing ability to flank, and it will negate the negative effects of Ninja Squid"
