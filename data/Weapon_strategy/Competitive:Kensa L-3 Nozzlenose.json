Run Speed Up can further increase this mobility, making its user a more difficult target to hit while firing.\nMain Power Up can increase its damage per shot, maxing out at 33.3 with 24 ability points - about two mains and one sub - as of version 5.1.0.\nComeback, Quick Respawn, and Stealth Jump are abilities that each encourage aggressive play for a slayer.\n\n- The ink coverage of the L-3 Nozzlenose is very efficient for turfing, which helps maintain map control and quickly build up the special gauge.\n\n- Its mobility, particularly while firing, is amazing for a middleweight weapon, outpacing the Splattershot Pro, the Splattershot, even the Splash-o-matic.

However, the Splash Wall can be deployed far more quickly, allowing its owner more time to reload ink or reposition themselves to a more favorable location.\n\n- If an opposing Brella user launches their shield, dropping a Splash Wall in front of it will cause both to negate one another, potentially denying a Rainmaker or Power Clam push.\n\n- At maximum, it takes 36-41% of the ink tank to launch a Brella shield and 60% to drop a Splash Wall. However, the Splash Wall can be deployed far more quickly, allowing its owner more time to reload ink or reposition themselves to a more favorable location.\n\n- In Splatoon 2, the Tower will destroy any Splash Wall it collides into. However, a Splash Wall may be placed onto the Tower to protect its user or their teammate while riding it. (Once again, watch out for the opponents' bombs.)\n\n- Refrain from either showering in or rushing through the wall until it is certain that the opponent has no bombs available in the area.\n\n- Do not throw a Splash Wall behind a teammate, as an opponent's bomb thrown into the wall can instantly splat them.\n\n- If an opposing Brella user launches their shield, dropping a Splash Wall in front of it will cause both to negate one another, potentially denying a Rainmaker or Power Clam push.\n\n- At maximum, it takes 36-41% of the ink tank to launch a Brella shield and 60% to drop a Splash Wall. However, the Splash Wall can be deployed far more quickly, allowing its owner more time to reload ink or reposition themselves to a more favorable location.\n\nIf used properly, the Ultra Stamp can tilt the game in the user's team's favor:\n\n- If Ultra Stamp is activated too far from an opponent, especially one with a long-ranged weapon with a straight trajectory (such as a charger or splatling), the opponent can fire in between hammer swings and splat the Ultra Stamp wielder. Either get close enough to an opponent or shark and wait for the opponent to come close before activating the Ultra Stamp, providing little to no time to react.\n\n- Do not run in a predictable manner while swinging the Ultra Stamp, as an adept opponent can outmaneuver past a Ultra Stamp user and splat them from behind.\n\n- It is possible to swim in friendly ink while Ultra Stamp is active. This allows an Ultra Stamp wielder to maneuver more easily than while swinging, climb vertical surfaces, cross grates, and – most importantly – hide more easily before striking.\n\n- Swinging the Ultra Stamp in midair can splat opponents who are higher than ground level, such as on the edge of a ledge that is just too high to reach by jumping — and even at the apex of a Splashdown![5]\n\n- The Ultra Stamp can quickly destroy brella shields, most sub weapons — including Splash Walls, and Ballers, allowing one to break through opposing defenses and stop opponents' pushes. Just stay away from opposing bombs that are just about to detonate.\n\n- While the Ultra Stamp can quickly pop the Rainmaker shield, as it expands, the shield can splat an Ultra Stamp user who is too close. Keep a safe distance by constantly jumping back while striking the shield.[6]\n\n- Do not forget that the Ultra Stamp can be thrown by pressing :\nWhen faced against an opponent with a long-ranged weapon (such as a charger or splatling) from long distance, it is usually wiser to throw the Ultra Stamp at the opponent than to either charge or swim towards them. A well-aimed thrown Ultra Stamp can throw off an opponent's aim or displace them from their spot, potentially providing enough time to close the distance.\nTo maximize the use of an Ultra Stamp, throw it towards an opponent at or near the end of its 9 second duration after splatting any nearby opponents. An Ultra Stamp should only be thrown early if no other options are present, such as preventing a faraway opposing Rainmaker carrier from taking the lead.\n\n- When faced against an opponent with a long-ranged weapon (such as a charger or splatling) from long distance, it is usually wiser to throw the Ultra Stamp at the opponent than to either charge or swim towards them.

This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.\n\nIncreases main weapon damage up to 33.3 per shot. The Kensa L-3 Nozzlenose is a weapon that has a close potential for a three hit splat, or a one hit splat per  if the opponent has touched enemy ink for at least one frame.\n\n- 24 ability points – achievable with either eight subs or one main and five subs – are enough to reach the Kensa L-3 Nozzlenose's damage cap of 33.3 HP.[8]\n\n- For a smaller but nearly-effective investment, 16 ability points – reached with six subs or one main and two subs – are enough to exceed 32 HP of damage, while 6 ability points – just two subs – will exceed 30 HP.[8]\n\nIncreases running speed, particularly while firing.\n\nSuper Jumping to a teammate after respawning carries the risk of getting splatted upon landing, due to the appearance of a Super Jump indicator. When equipped, Stealth Jump better covers this indicator from long distance opponents, allowing its user to more safely return to the front lines and maintain pressure on the opponent.\n\n[9][10]"
