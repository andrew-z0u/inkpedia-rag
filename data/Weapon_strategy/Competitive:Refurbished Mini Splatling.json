    "Gear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.",
    "Run Speed Up will boost the walking speed of the user, making the Refurbished Mini Splatling's already good strafe speed even better. This improved speed can allow a Refurbished Mini Splatling user to continuously remain outside of the range of shorter ranged opponents and weave their way around enemy attacks, making them much harder to hit.",
    "A Refurbished Mini Splatling user will often find themselves walking in and out of enemy ink, especially while engaging an enemy in battle. Ink Resistance Up can prove quite useful as it will not only improve one's mobility in enemy ink but reduce the total amount of damage they will take, increasing the user's survivability.",
