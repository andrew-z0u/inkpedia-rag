All other dualies require four hits to splat.\nGiven its fast fire rate, the Dapple Dualies can deal damage quickly to objects such as the Rainmaker shield, brella shields, and Splash Walls\n\n- Its base damage of 36 allows the user to splat opponents in three hits, a property shared only with the Glooga Dualies. All other dualies require four hits to splat.\n\n- Given its fast fire rate, the Dapple Dualies can deal damage quickly to objects such as the Rainmaker shield, brella shields, and Splash Walls\n\n- The Dapple Dualies also has some downsides:\nLike other dualies, dodge rolling can accumulate small points of damage which can allow opponents to splat the user quicker.\nThe dodge rolls of the Dapple Dualies travel the shortest distance of all the dualies, which can sometimes leave the user still in the opponent's range even after dodge rolling.\nThe Dapple Dualies have shorter range compared to most other weapons, which can result in the Dapple Dualies user being splatted. Paired with only Squid Beakon, the user will have a hard time poking longer distanced opponents if they are locked out.\n\n- Like other dualies, dodge rolling can accumulate small points of damage which can allow opponents to splat the user quicker.\n\n- The dodge rolls of the Dapple Dualies travel the shortest distance of all the dualies, which can sometimes leave the user still in the opponent's range even after dodge rolling.\n\n- The Dapple Dualies have shorter range compared to most other weapons, which can result in the Dapple Dualies user being splatted. Paired with only Squid Beakon, the user will have a hard time poking longer distanced opponents if they are locked out.\n\n- Dapple Dualies are used best with high sensitivity.\n\n- The dodge rolls are performed quickly and can get the user out of danger in a pinch.\n\n- They are also helpful when Super Jumping, as the speed can get the user out of enemy fire quickly.\n\n- Although quick, be wary of any enemy fire as the endlag can leave the user exposed.\n\n- Its base damage of 36 allows the user to splat opponents in three hits, a property shared only with the Glooga Dualies.

Paired with only Squid Beakon, the user will have a hard time poking longer distanced opponents if they are locked out.\n\nThe Squid Beakon, while not useful for attacking, can provide other uses:\n\n- The main purpose of the Squid Beakon is to provide a place for the user's team to Super Jump to. Place Squid Beakons in hidden places and enemy blind spots, as the enemy team can destroy Beakons by shooting at them.\n\n- The Squid Beakon can also be used as a temporary shield. If under fire, place a Squid Beakon and the shots will be blocked until the Beakon breaks\n\n- The Squid Beakon can be used as bait. Hide in ink near the Beakon, and when an opponent comes close to it, quickly splat them and dodge away.\nNote that this may not work if the opponent has a long range weapon.\nBe careful not to waste too much time around the Beakon.\n\n- Note that this may not work if the opponent has a long range weapon.\n\n- Be careful not to waste too much time around the Beakon.\n\n- Note that this may not work if the opponent has a long range weapon.\n\n- Be careful not to waste too much time around the Beakon.\n\nWhen used at the right time, the Suction-Bomb Launcher can turn the tide of a battle:\n\n- Using any Bomb Launcher too close to an opponent will leave its user vulnerable to attack, so activate it outside the opponents' range.\n\n- Suction-Bomb Launcher can either capture or hold onto a zone or another important area of the map, such as around the opponents' clam basket.\n\n- It can also stall or stop an opponent's Tower push in a more direct manner than Sting Ray does. Note that attempting to stop the Tower in this manner forces you to be closer to the Tower, whereas Sting Ray can be used from a further, safer distance.\n\n- Suction-Bomb Launcher can quickly pop the Rainmaker shield to instantly start or restart a Rainmaker push.\n\n- An opponent's Splashdown or Booyah Bomb will defuse any Suction Bombs it comes in contact with. If possible, hold off activating Suction-Bomb Launcher until after the opponents have exhausted their special weapons first.\n\nWhile one user of a short-ranged weapon such as the Dapple Dualies might get away with a lack of range, having too many short-ranged weapons on a team without a longer-ranged weapon to provide support fire is often disadvantageous for a number of reasons:[1]\n\n- An opponent with a long-ranged weapon can more aggressively position themselves to zone out the entire shorter-ranged team.\n\n- The opposing slayers can play more aggressively, knowing that there is no long-ranged threat to pick them off from afar.\n\nThe Dapple Dualies' lack of lethal bombs can also be a liability to a team composition. Lethal bombs – particularly either Splat or Suction Bombs – provide their user's team a couple advantages over another team that has no lethal bombs in its composition:[1]\n\n- Their one-hit-splat offers its user's team chances of instantly gaining a numbers advantage, from which a game-winning push can arise.\nThe Dapple Dualies in specific can often splat one or more players fast enough to accomplish this with just the main weapon, though not always to the same extent as a lethal bomb.\n\n- The Dapple Dualies in specific can often splat one or more players fast enough to accomplish this with just the main weapon, though not always to the same extent as a lethal bomb.\n\n- Their lethal explosion provides space for its user's team to either push into an area held by the opponent or stall an opponent's push.\n\n- The Dapple Dualies in specific can often splat one or more players fast enough to accomplish this with just the main weapon, though not always to the same extent as a lethal bomb.\n\nThe Suction-Bomb Launcher is very effective at contesting territory, such as Splat Zones, but is not as reliable at splatting opponents who actively avoid the bombs. Attempting to pursue certain opponents with Suction-Bomb Launcher active further risks getting splatted. Therefore, it is advised to have other special weapons available to complement Suction-Bomb Launcher, as having too many users of any Bomb Launcher variant (no more than two) in a team composition will limit a team's arsenal of weapons:\n\n- Other than the launched bombs, a Bomb Launcher user has no means of protection and is particularly vulnerable to long-ranged fire.\n\n- Other special weapons, such as Inkjet or Sting Ray, are intended for splatting opponents and more capable at this than most Bomb Launcher variants.\n\nCoordinating with your teammates can greatly increase the Suction-Bomb Launcher's effect during a battle:\n\n- Ink Armor can increase the survivability of a Suction-Bomb Launcher user, freeing them to push the opponents further back. If a teammate has a weapon that can farm Ink Armor, it might pay off to wait until they activate it.\n\n- Remaining behind a teammate with an active protective special weapon, such as Baller or Bubble Blower, can also give a Suction-Bomb Launcher user room to operate.\nThe Suction-Bomb Launcher can also be used to pop teammates' bubbles in the event that the space they control ceases to be safe, effectively clearing the area around them for whoever the bubbles protected.\n\n- The Suction-Bomb Launcher can also be used to pop teammates' bubbles in the event that the space they control ceases to be safe, effectively clearing the area around them for whoever the bubbles protected.\n\n- Pushing forward with Suction-Bomb Launcher while a teammate is using a special designed to splat opponents, such as Sting Ray or Inkjet, can limit the opponents' escape options and even prevent them from Super Jumping to safety.\n\n- The Suction-Bomb Launcher can also be used to pop teammates' bubbles in the event that the space they control ceases to be safe, effectively clearing the area around them for whoever the bubbles protected.\n\n- Matchups between Dapple Dualies users on opposing teams are determined by each player's skill, positioning, turf control, and the presence of any teammates.\n\n- Any weapon that has a combination of longer range, better accuracy, or higher damage output without sacrificing too much mobility can counter the Dapple Dualies. For example, both the Kensa Splattershot Pro and L-3 Nozzlenose and their respective variants meet all of these requirements.\n\n- Whenever the Dapple Dualies dodge roll, they are likely to briefly touch enemy ink, accumulating small amounts of damage. Weapons that use Main Power Up, such as the Kensa Splattershot Pro, Custom Dualie Squelchers, and the Bamboozler 14 Mk I not only have a range advantage, but can often splat the Dapple Dualies faster than the user can splat them.\n\n- Users of long-ranged weapons, such as chargers and other splatlings, outrange an opposing Dapple Dualies user and can fire upon them with impunity. Chargers can also predict where a Dapple Dualies user will be after a roll and splat them before they can fire. However, once the Dapple Dualies gets close, it can outmaneuver and outdraw its less mobile, slower firing opponent.\n\n- A competent Dapple Dualies user is likely capable at both flanking and sharking:\nKeep track of all four members of the opposing team – which ones are present, which ones are splatted, and which ones are back at their spawn point.\nCheck the map periodically for opposing ink forming around flanks to anticipate a flanking attack.\nTo prevent sharking, check suspicious puddles of the opponents' ink, preferably with a thrown sub weapon.\nWeapons that track opponents, such as Point Sensors, temporarily prevent an opponent from sharking and make them an easier target for long-ranged teammates to pick off.\n\n- Keep track of all four members of the opposing team – which ones are present, which ones are splatted, and which ones are back at their spawn point.\n\n- Check the map periodically for opposing ink forming around flanks to anticipate a flanking attack.\n\n- To prevent sharking, check suspicious puddles of the opponents' ink, preferably with a thrown sub weapon.\n\n- Weapons that track opponents, such as Point Sensors, temporarily prevent an opponent from sharking and make them an easier target for long-ranged teammates to pick off.\n\n- When pursued by a Dapple Dualies user, using almost any sub weapon (except for Squid Beakons) can either delay their pursuit or deter them from chasing.\n\n- The Dapple Dualies, having one of the fastest times to splat in the entire game and very high mobility, will win the majority of engagements that the user can get in range to take. Because of this, the most effective way to fight a Dapple Dualies user is to play outside of their range. The Dapple Dualies are outranged by the majority of other weapons, even many weapons typically seen as extremely short range slayers.\nWhen fighting a Dapple Dualies user, also keep in mind that the Dapple Dualies offer two dodge rolls. While the rolls are relatively short, they're very quick and can often quickly and easily close the distance between the user and their opponent.\n\n- When fighting a Dapple Dualies user, also keep in mind that the Dapple Dualies offer two dodge rolls.

Be careful of their dodge rolls however\n\n- Certain special weapons – such as Splashdown, Booyah Bomb, and Ultra Stamp – can negate the opponents' bombs if timed properly.\n\n- A counter Bomb Launcher can nullify the effects of Suction-Bomb Launcher, preventing its user's team from either capping a zone or continuing a push.\n\nGear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.\n\nA Dapple Dualies user is usually expected to lead pushes towards their opponents' side, which puts them at risk of damage from opposing bombs and special weapons. Introduced in version 4.3.0, Bomb Defense Up DX will not only reduce the nonlethal damage taken from opponents' sub and special weapons but will also reduce the tracking duration of opponents' Ink Mines and Point Sensors, allowing the user of this ability to evade detection more easily. Just three ability points, or one sub, offer plenty of utility:\n\n- The splash damage of most bombs is reduced from 30 HP to 28.6 HP. This reduction in damage provides two benefits:\nIt prevents its user from being exposed on their opponents' map by the splash damage of most single bombs.\nInk Armor will not break due to splash damage from a single bomb whose splash damage normally inflicts 30 HP of damage.\n\n- It prevents its user from being exposed on their opponents' map by the splash damage of most single bombs.\n\n- Ink Armor will not break due to splash damage from a single bomb whose splash damage normally inflicts 30 HP of damage.\n\n- The splash damage of near-misses from either Tenta Missiles or Inkjet, the minimum splash damage of bubbles, and the collision damage from Baller are all reduced from 50 HP to 48.3 HP, enabling one to survive two hits from any of these specific means of special weapon damage.\n\n- It prevents its user from being exposed on their opponents' map by the splash damage of most single bombs.\n\n- Ink Armor will not break due to splash damage from a single bomb whose splash damage normally inflicts 30 HP of damage.\n\nQuick Respawn shortens respawn time after getting splatted (under specific conditions), encouraging a Dapple Dualies user to remain aggressive even after getting splatted.\n\n- 26 ability points – two mains and two subs – are enough to reduce the respawn time from 8.5 seconds to 5.8 seconds.\n\nQuick Super Jump decreases both the \"charge\" time before and the travel time of a Super Jump. Dapple Dualies users who include this ability will benefit in two ways since Quick Super Jump allows them to both return to the front lines more quickly and escape unfavorable situations more easily to preserve special gauge progress.\n\n- Just three ability points, or one sub, of Quick Super Jump decreases the \"charge\" time by 22 frames, or 0.36 seconds.\n\nSub Power Up decreases the time it takes to Super Jump to a Squid Beakon. Sub Power Up can help a Dapple Dualies user benefit from Squid Beakons more and allow their team to get back to the battlefield quickly to push.\n\nA self-explanatory ability, Swim Speed Up enables an already mobile Dapple Dualies user to more rapidly close the distance towards an opponent, more quickly respond to an opponents' push, or even escape unfavorable situations.\n\n- 16 ability points – one main and two subs – increase the swim speed from 2.02 to 2.19 units per frame.\n\n[2][3]"
