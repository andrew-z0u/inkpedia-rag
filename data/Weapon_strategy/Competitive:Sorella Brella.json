    "Like the original Splat Brella, the Sorella Brella is designed to restrain the opponents' mobility with its shield, which demands a different, more advanced playing style from other weapon classes. As the first variant of an existing brella-type weapon, its has a kit that permits a more aggressive playstyle than that of the Vanilla variant.",
    "The Sorella Brella has traits of both a tank skirmisher and a zoning support weapon:",
    "While not always as reliable as some other bombs — partly due to having a smaller explosion radius, Autobombs can still be used in a similar fashion and have some unique utility:",
    "The Splat-Bomb Launcher is designed to either help push into a highly contested area or help repel the opponent's push:",
    "[15]",
    "Like the Splat Brella, the Sorella Brella allows its user to control space by restraining the movement of their opponents, particularly slayers armed with shooters or dualies. Use your good survivability to prolong battles and distract the opponents away from the objective, which your teammates can then push.[3][16]",
    "While a team might get away with having one or two users of short-ranged weapons, such as the Sorella Brella, having a team composition with too many short-ranged weapons and no longer-ranged weapons to provide support fire is often disadvantageous for a number of reasons:[17]",
    "While Autobombs technically count as a lethal bomb, they are noticeably easier to avoid. Due to this, try to include weapons that have either Splat or Suction Bombs in their kits, which provide its user's team many advantages over another team that has no lethal bombs in its composition:[17]",
    "The Splat-Bomb Launcher is very effective at contesting territory, such as Splat Zones, but is not as reliable at splatting opponents who actively avoid the bombs. Attempting to pursue certain opponents with Splat-Bomb Launcher active further risks getting splatted. Therefore, it is advised to have other special weapons available to complement Splat-Bomb Launcher, as having too many users of any Bomb Launcher variant (no more than two) in a team composition will limit a team's arsenal of weapons:[17]",
    "Coordinating with your teammates can greatly increase the Splat-Bomb Launcher's effect during a battle:",
    "Gear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.",
    "Because bombs are a good countermeasure against an opposing brella user, a Sorella Brella user can expect to have the opponents' bombs thrown their way. Ever since its introduction in version 4.3.0, Bomb Defense Up DX will not only reduce the damage taken from opposing sub and special weapons that are not one-hit-splat but will also reduce the duration of the tracking effects of certain opponent's sub and special weapons, such as Point Sensors and Ink Mines, allowing the user of this ability to evade detection more easily. Just three ability points, or one sub, offer plenty of utility:[19][20]",
    "When equipped, Comeback grants 10 ability points of six different stackable abilities for twenty seconds after respawning from getting splatted by an opponent:",
    "While a Sorella Brella wielder who plays aggressively would benefit from all of these abilities, they would profit mostly from Ink Recovery Up, Ink Saver (Main), and Run Speed Up, which respectively improve the ink recovery and efficiency of the main weapon and strafing speed while either shooting or shielding.[15][19]",
    "As a large consumer of ink, the Sorella Brella can be fired and launched more often if its user can refill their ink tank at a faster rate. A valuable utility ability for almost any weapon, Ink Recovery Up is even more useful for a Sorella Brella user, particularly to quickly recover ink after either launching their shield or using a Sprinkler.[19][20]",
    "Opponent's ink on various surfaces can not only be damaging to a Sorella Brella user but can also reduce mobility, particularly when strafing. Ink Resistance Up not only partially offsets the reduction in mobility but also delays the damage taken from contact with opposing ink.[19][20]",
    "[9]",
    "The Sorella Brella consumes a sizable amount of ink per shot — about as much as a Slosher or a Kensa Rapid Blaster. Its user also has to consider the large amount of ink required to launch their shield. Ink Saver (Main) helps mitigate this issue by reducing ink consumption per shot and brella launch.[15][19] However, it is not advised to devote more than six ability points, or two subs, to Ink Saver (Main) due to both diminishing returns and fewer available ability points for mobility-enhancing abilities.[6]",
    "[9]",
    "Last-Ditch Effort is a headgear-exclusive ability that, under specific conditions, grants its user 1 to 24 ability points each of the following abilities:",
    "These abilities only begin to take effect under either of the following conditions:",
    "A Sorella Brella user can potentially benefit greatly from Last-Ditch Effort, particularly from Ink Saver (Main) and Ink Recovery Up, allowing them to improve their overall ink efficiency while saving more ability points for other abilities.[19]",
    "While swimming is still the Sorella Brella user's main means of travel, their strafing speed while either firing or opening their shield will be improved with Run Speed Up, enabling them to better evade and repel opponents' attacks.[19]",
    "Quick Super Jump decreases both the \"charge\" time before and the travel time of a Super Jump. Sorella Brella users will benefit since Quick Super Jump allows them to both return to the front lines more quickly and escape unfavorable situations more easily to preserve special gauge progress.[19][20]",
    "The Sorella Brella has shorter range than most other weapons, meaning that its user will have to get within range of their longer-ranged opponents in order to be effective in battle. Swim Speed Up enables its user to more quickly close the distance towards an opponent, more quickly respond to an opponents' push, or even escape unfavorable situations.[19]",
    "[22][23]",
    "The Sorella Brella returns in Splatoon 3, with a loadout of Autobomb and Inkjet. It is a frontline weapon that specializes in skirmishing. Its general play-style is to distract and disrupt opponents while taking away resources from them with its survivability.[24]",
    "Gear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.",
    "Inkjet is incredibly important on the Sorella Brella for retakes and continuing its momentum. 2 subs is recommended.[24]",
    "The Sorella Brella is an ink-hungry weapon. 1-3 subs is recommended.[24]",
    "Both abilities are essential to improve the user's mobility, as the brella user is most vulnerable when their shield is down. This, combined with its short range, means the brella user can close the gap quicker. 1 main and 1 sub of both abilities is recommended.[24]",
    "While not needed, it is very useful on Inkjet weapons as it increases the shot radius and the time spent in the air. 2-4 subs can be used if there is room in the build.[24]",
    "1 sub of Quick Super Jump and 2 subs of Special Saver are recommended as utility subs.[24]",
    "- It has a short-ranged (111.04 DU),[5] slow-firing (16 frames between bursts) shotgun-like blast of six pellets at a maximum damage of 81 HP per burst, which prevents it from having a one-burst-splat against most opponents.\nA Sorella Brella user will have to be even more accurate and precise with their aim than would users of automatically firing weapons, as any missed shot would leave them wide open to attack before the brella shield is up. Aiming down at the body of your opponent – rather than up at their head – will ensure that more pellets will hit their target and damage output is maximized.[6]\nWhile its shot spread is quick at turfing, a Sorella Brella is not quite as quick or efficient at turfing as are more conventional support weapons.",

This can be a useful tactic against opposing blaster users who attempt to fire above the brella shield.[8]\nIt takes 122 frames (2.03 seconds) and 36.35% of the ink tank (including the 6.35% for firing a shot) to launch the shield, which then travels forward at 1.32 DU/f, takes half the normal damage from opponents' attacks, and remains on the stage for up to five seconds.\nThe shield – whether attached or launched – can damage opponents on contact for 30 HP. This technique (with an attached shield) can be used in combos with the weapon's shots to quickly splat opponents who charge toward you.[8]\nA launched brella shield will be instantly destroyed upon contact with another brella shield, a Splash Wall, or the Rainmaker shield.\nIf the shield is launched or destroyed, it will take 390 frames, or 6.5 seconds, to regenerate. Main Power Up can shorten the regeneration time to as low as 210 frames, or 3.5 seconds.[9] Before launching your brella shield, make sure you can survive without it during the regeneration time.",

If thrown off to the side or behind the user, the bombs can still limit the Sorella Brella's movement.\nA fully-charged Fizzy Bomb will instantly break a Sorella Brella's shield. If the opponent opts to not shield the damage, they will likely take some splash damage from the Fizzy Bomb.\nAny bomb with a tracking function – either Autobombs or Torpedoes – can force an opposing Sorella Brella user to lower their shield and either move to dodge the bomb or, in the case of Torpedoes, shoot it down.\nToxic Mist is particularly effective against Sorella Brellas due to its ink tank-draining capabilities. If thrown at the Sorella Brella user, they can either choose to slowly strafe away with shield up as the Toxic Mist depletes their ink tank, or swim away, from which they can be picked off due to having to drop their shield.\nA Splash Wall can destroy a Sorella Brella shield launched by an opponent upon contact.",

    "- One of the brella's greatest strengths is its shield HP regeneration whenever the shield is dropped. This can mean it can take an incredibly long time for opponents to break your shield.[24]",
    "- A Sorella Brella user should be maximizing their shielding and mobility while fighting. What the brella user does when they are not shielding is important to minimize damage done to the player and stall opponents for longer. Some options include:\nStrafing. Movement speed changes between shielding and shooting, and is a good option to mix up movement.[24]\nJumping. Since the Sorella Brella does not suffer from worse accuracy in the air and can shield its landing, this is also a good option.[24]\nSwimming. A fast option, and the animation for the shield dropping can make it harder for opponents to see where you are going. This option is also good for recovering ink quickly, as there are no white ink frames for shielding. It is worth noting that this option is dependent on map control, but shielding also paints under the user's feet.[24]\nShield launching. A niche option, which can be used if cornered by an opponent. After launching, the brella user can either Super Jump away or engage the opponent before the shield goes too far away. A more advanced technique is launching the shield into a corner, where the player can be protected from the other side of it. A moving shield can also protect a Power Clam or Rainmaker carrier.[24]\nInkjet. This option immediately gives the user a lot of height and access to a one-shot splat. It also requires good positioning, as using it too close to the enemy can result in getting splatted early before you can keep your distance.[24]",
    "- Due to the weapons ink consumption, it is not recommended to use Autobombs while fighting, unless the user has a full ink tank. The brella user can use them from a distance while not fighting to help teammates, or for scouting enemies before using Inkjet. Inkjet can also be used in a fight when the user's ink tank is low from throwing an Autobomb.[24]",
    "- Sorella Brella's best matchups are against the shooter, dualie, and splatling classes. These classes in particular have lower damage multipliers when dealing damage to the brella's shield. However, some of these have access to bombs which can do massive damage to the shield.[24]",
    "- The Sorella Brella excels in team fights. Having a teammate from a different angle nearby while fighting can stall multiple opponents and make up for the brella's inability to splat opponents quickly.[24]\nFor this reason, it is important to position near your teammates or more relevant map angles, and is less advised to go on flanks or areas of the map where your teammates cannot support you.[24]",
    "- When your team is in control, it is important to hold aggressive angles and stall out opposing front-line weapons.[24]",
    "- The Sorella Brella's shield also can disrupt some opponent's special weapons:\nIt can block an Ink Vac shot, making it explode earlier.[24]\nIt can take around two Inkjet shots before breaking.[24]\nIt can withstand the beginning of Crab Tank's rapid-fire mode before breaking.[24]",

    "- The Sorella Brella's worst matchups are against the blaster and charger classes. Blasters can hit around the shield, and chargers do massive damage to the shield from a distance. Both classes can also shoot the brella user in the air while using its Inkjet. This requires the brella user to get very close and splat the opponent quickly to come out on top.[24]",
