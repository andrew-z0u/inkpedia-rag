    "Introduced in the version 4.2.0 update, the Torpedo is a unique sub weapon that has two phases, each with different applications. While it inflicts less damage than lethal bombs, its rolling phase can be combined with a shot from a main weapon, particularly the Kensa Rapid Blaster. The homing phase can be a noxious distraction tool against opponents.",
    "The Torpedo's initial phase behaves like a lighter, weaker Splat Bomb:[1][2]",
    "- As long as a Torpedo hits any surface without getting near an opponent, it will not transform into its homing phase and will detonate one second after contact.",
    "- Torpedoes can be rolled slightly farther and higher (off of ramps) than Splat Bombs, enabling them to reach opponents at farther distances.",
    "- You can even drop a Torpedo at your feet and combo off of its damage if an opponent gets too close.",
    "- As with other bombs, the damage inflicted by a rolled Torpedo onto a target depends on the distance between them:[4]\nTargets within 30 DU will receive 60 HP of damage, which will weaken opponents enough to get splatted in one or two shots.\nTargets between 30 DU and 60 DU will receive 35 HP of damage, which is sometimes enough to splat weakened opponents.",
    "- Rolled Torpedoes can also turf the ground, increasing the mobility of slow-firing weapon users.",
    "If the Torpedo finds an opponent while airborne, it transitions into its homing phase before launching towards its target in a straight line:",
    "- Its homing phase can track and expose opponents hiding in their ink, reducing the effectiveness of their sharking attempts.",
    "- Any opposing attack of at least 20 HP will destroy and defuse the torpedo. Users of rapidly-firing shooters and dualies have an easier time at this than users of slower-firing weapons.\nOpposing ink-guzzling weapon users will also have to use a sizable portion of their ink tank that would otherwise be used to attack your and your teammates.",
    "- A Torpedo in homing phase that strikes an opponent or surface will explode and release droplets, up to three which can damage an opponent.",
    "Although less powerful than other bombs, a Torpedo can still damage or even destroy an opponent's brella shield, Splash Wall, or Baller or the Rainmaker shield, while detonating on contact.",
    "- Any opponents caught within the Torpedo's explosion will get damaged or splatted.[5]",
    "- It will also inflate or pop both your and any teammate's bubbles but deflate or diffuse an opponent's bubbles, while still detonating on contact.[6] This enables a Kensa Splattershot Jr. user (with Object Shredder and enough ability points of Special Power Up) to instapop their bubbles.",
    "- An opponent's Splashdown, Booyah Bomb, or Ultra Stamp will defuse any Torpedoes it touches, so hold off using them until after their special weapon finishes.",
    "- Using any special weapon also provides a free ink tank refill. For example, a Kensa Undercover Brella user can throw Torpedoes before and after activating Ink Armor.",
    "While versatile, the Torpedo lacks the damage output to be a lethal bomb. Lethal bombs – particularly Splat or Suction Bombs – provide their user's team many advantages over another team that has no lethal bombs in its composition:[7]",
    "- Their one-hit-splat offers its user's team chances of instantly gaining a numbers advantage, from which a game-winning push can arise.",
    "- Their lethal explosion provides space for its user's team to either push into an area held by the opponent or stall an opponent's push.",
    "- The turf inked by the resulting explosion contributes to both maintaining map control and building up the special gauge.",
    "The homing phase of the Torpedo makes it a great tool to check flanks and reveal any sharking opponents, reducing the likelihood of a surprise attack sabotaging your team:",
    "- While opposing mobile weapon users (e.g., Splattershot or Tri-Slosher) are more likely to flank, some opposing longer-ranged weapon users might try to flank as well. A thrown Torpedo can detect the presence of a flanker without over-committing yourself.",
    "- Opposing shorter-ranged, high DPS weapon users (e.g., Sploosh-o-matic, Carbon Roller are more likely to shark than their longer-ranged teammates. If you notice any suspicious puddles of opposing ink (e.g., beneath ledges or around a corner), then tossing a Torpedo will detect and flush out any sharking opponents.[8]",
    "The threat level of an opponent armed with Torpedoes can range from a constant annoyance to a lethal serial splatter, depending on their ability to combo rolled Torpedoes with their main weapon. The homing phase also gives them a means to catch you or your teammates flanking or sharking, making them harder to sneak up to. Because only four weapons – the Kensa Splattershot Jr., the Kensa Rapid Blaster, the Clear Dapple Dualies, and the Kensa Undercover Brella – have Torpedoes in their kits, remembering and recognizing them should not be too difficult.",
    "- In general, keep a safe distance from an opposing Torpedo user – particularly an opposing Kensa Rapid Blaster user – to avoid getting caught in a Torpedo combo until you are fully ready to challenge the opposing Torpedo user.",
    "- If you do get close to an opposing Torpedo user, do not forget that they can drop a Torpedo at their feet for a quick, close-quarters combo.[1]",
    "- If you plan on flanking or sharking, unless an opposing Torpedo user is distracted enough to not notice you, generally stay clear of them since they can easily expose your with their Torpedoes.",
    "- Whenever reasonably possible, shoot down opponents' Torpedoes as soon as possible to prevent both the damage and the turfing from the resulting droplets.",
    "- Be aware of your opponents' locations before using a brella shield, Splash Wall, Baller, or Bubble Blower, as an opponent's Torpedoes will detonate upon impact with any of these, damaging or even splatting you or your teammates if caught within their blast.",
    "- Certain special weapons – such as Splashdown, Booyah Bomb, and Ultra Stamp – can negate any of the opponents' Torpedoes."
