    "When used, Bubbler creates a bubble shield around the user, which protects from all damage, in exchange for taking knockback whenever you're hit. It can be spread to teammates by making contact with them. It doesn't protect you from water or falling off of the stage.",
    "TBA",
    "Try and get them to fall into water or off of the stage as Bubblers don't protect them from this. You could also try and tail them until their Bubbler runs out and then splat them."
