    "Like its Vanilla and Deco variants, the Kensa Glooga Dualies are dualies with the unique trait of increasing their range and damage after a dodge roll. While they do have what could be considered the best kit in the game, the main weapon does not match its kit's playstyle. As a result, the Kensa Glooga Dualies are used to both support their team with their kit, and splat opponents with their main weapon.[1]",
    "The Kensa Glooga Dualies can be used as a slayer as well as a support:",
    "- Being a dualie, the Kensa Glooga Dualies possess the ability to dodge roll.\nThe dodge rolls are at a similar speed to those of the Splat Dualies. While the dodge rolls are not slow, they are not fast either, and should not be used without thought.\nAfter rolling, there is a long endlag where the player will be immobile for 42 frames, which can leave the user exposed to close-up enemies.\nWhile in turret mode, the Kensa Glooga Dualies' range and damage are both increased, with the damage being able to splat opponents in two hits compared to the usual three.\nWith their long endlag and higher damage and range in turret mode, the Kensa Glooga Dualies' dodge rolls should not so much be used to avoid enemy fire, but instead to give themselves distance and splat opponents.",
    "- The Kensa Glooga Dualies' range and damage after dodge-rolling can make them a real threat with their splatting power.\nTheir range allows the user to splat opponents with shorter ranged weapons such as the Neo Splash-o-matic and Kensa Splattershot without entering into their range.\nWhile they can already outrange opponents, the accuracy increase also allows the user to splat opponents more reliably.\nWhile opponents with longer range, such as the Kensa Splattershot Pro can still outrange the user, the Kensa Glooga Dualies' dodge rolls can still be used to dodge attacks and be more mobile.\nThe high damage after dodge rolling splats opponents in two hits, allowing the user to quickly splat opponents.\nThe better accuracy and range of post-roll shots allow the user to win most fights against other two-shot opponents.\nWith 2 mains and 2 subs of Main Power Up, it is possible to splat an opponent with one turret mode shot and one normal shot, giving the user more flexibility in splatting opponents[2].",
    "- The Kensa Glooga Dualies, along with these strengths, have a few weaknesses.\nTheir slow dodge rolls and long endlag will often leave the user exposed. Be careful with dodge rolls to avoid being splatted by opponents.\nThe Kensa Glooga Dualies' turfing capability is mediocre, making it difficult for the weapon to turf. Be careful of enemy ink to avoid getting trapped in it.\nFizzy Bombs can turf much more efficiently than the main weapon, but watch the ink tank when using them to avoid running out of ink.\nTheir fire rate is slower than most other weapons. Keep a fair distance from most shorter ranged, faster fire rate opponents.",
    "Fizzy Bombs can provide great coverage and pressure with splash hits, even in stages and areas that are more open:",
    "- Fizzy Bombs can create combos of splash damage with the shots from the main weapon.",
    "- Fizzy Bombs can explode multiple times, making it easier to explode Bubbles or inflate them.",
    "- Defensively, they can provide great pressure on the objective or onto opponents trying to take control over areas. It can also provide distance between a rushing opponent when thrown towards the ground.[3]",
    "- Offensively, it can create paths with its ink trail that can lead into close confrontations with opponents.\nInk Saver (Sub) or Last-Ditch Effort can reduce the ink consumption needed to throw a Fizzy Bomb to below half of a full ink tank, making it possible to throw two Fizzy Bombs one after the other. This provides great pressure through ink coverage and splash damage hits.\nThis can be combined with an Ink Armor. Using special weapons instantly refills the ink tank, so a user of the Kensa Glooga Dualies could throw two Fizzy Bombs, then activate Ink Armor, and throw two more Fizzy Bombs, which would force opponents out of an area and ink the ground especially well. This allows a single player to gain map control for their team, if used right.",
    "Ink Armor protects its user and all of their active teammates, reducing their chances of getting splatted and allowing them to either initiate a push – to recapture a Splat Zone for example – or maintain one, such as while locking out the opponent.",
    "- Activate Ink Armor in a safe location, particularly while not under attack. A player activating Ink Armor is locked in place for 30 frames, or 0.5 seconds, and if they get splatted during this time, Ink Armor will not be applied to any of their teammates.",
    "- Time the activation of Ink Armor carefully; it takes up to two seconds to activate Ink Armor, which lasts for at least six seconds or until its wearer has taken 30 HP of damage. Applying Ink Armor too early might not provide enough protection time, while waiting too long to use it might result in teammates getting splatted before receiving sufficient protection. Count the number of active opponents on the HUD and check your teammates' positions relative to the opponents' turf on the map with  to determine whether to activate Ink Armor right away.",
    "- Teammates who have just been splatted and have not yet respawned will not receive the protection from Ink Armor, so try to activate Ink Armor when most or all teammates are active. Skirmishers and slayers, who risk getting splatted more often, benefit from Ink Armor more than anchors do.",
    "- Be aware that Ink Armor will make its user and their teammates more visible, particularly within their ink. Therefore, if a teammate has a short-ranged slayer's weapon that relies heavily on sharking (such as a roller or a Sploosh-o-matic), check the map with  to see if this teammate is hiding among the opponents.",
    "- Upon activation, Ink Armor will protect its user and their teammates except for those either carrying the Rainmaker or using either Baller or Booyah Bomb.\nAlso, players protected by Ink Armor lose it upon gaining possession of the Rainmaker.\nA support player, such as a Kensa Glooga Dualies user, is usually expected to carry the Rainmaker while their slayer teammates provide protection up front while turfing a path of ink. Therefore, while Ink Armor will not protect the Rainmaker carrier, it will still benefit their teammates, so remember to activate Ink Armor just before picking up the Rainmaker whenever possible.",
    "- Any damage onto an armored player that exceeds 100 HP will not only be inflicted onto them – capped at 80 HP of damage – but will also cause significant knockback. Therefore, even while armored, it is still advisable to avoid getting hit by heavily damaging attacks, such as charger fire or bombs — especially when on a ledge or while riding the Tower.",
    "Because the Kensa Glooga Dualies are generally poor at turfing, their users will have to rely on their teammates to maintain map control. Not having enough turfing ability presents its own set of problems:[4]",
    "- A team whose composition lacks enough turfing ability can be rendered immobile if the other team dominates map control.",
    "- A lack of turfing also makes it difficult to alter the course of a game, even after wiping out the other team.",
    "Multiple Ink Armors used by the same team do not stack. Therefore, it would be redundant for a team to have more than two Ink Armor users.[4]",
    "- In general, when two Ink Armor-based weapons are on a team, the user of the more aggressive weapon should activate Ink Armor first, freeing them to engage the opponent without potentially losing both a potential Ink Armor and special gauge progress. Because this weapon is not particularly quick at turfing, they should generally wait for another Ink Armor-equipped teammate to activate their armor first then follow up with their Ink Armor as the first one wears off.",
    "While special weapons used in combination are beneficial in general, the combination of Ink Armor with either Inkjet or Ultra Stamp is particularly invaluable for the user of the latter special, improving their survivability:",
    "- Because an Ink Armored player can withstand more damage — especially from an opponent's charger, an armored Inkjet pilot can fly more aggressively.",
    "- An armored Ultra Stamp user is also more difficult for opponents to splat while swinging the hammer. However, they are easier to spot when submerged in their ink.",
    "- The Kensa Glooga Dualies is a formidable foe for most other weapons, due to its range and damage output. Therefore, most other weapons cannot easily defeat it in a straight one-on-one matchup and must use other means to defeat it.\nA matchup between two opposing Kensa Glooga Dualies wielders will depend on skill, positioning, turf control, and the presence of any supporting players.\nTo engage a Kensa Glooga Dualies with a shorter range weapon, try to catch it off guard through either careful flanking or sharking, better positioning, or wise use of bombs. Do not forget that the Kensa Glooga Dualies also has Fizzy Bombs as well.\nBoth variants of the Splat Brella can decently counter the Kensa Glooga Dualies due to the durability of their shields. Variants of the Tenta Brella are more damaging and provide more protection, provided that their shields are opened early enough. Variants of the Undercover Brella, however, are too weak to match the Kensa Glooga Dualies' damage, and their shields are not sturdy enough to provide sufficient protection.\nTry to take advantage of the Kensa Glooga Dualies' relative inability to turf by containing it with ink. This might require the use of sub weapons and teammates.\nA few weapons that either match or exceed the range of the Kensa Glooga Dualies without sacrificing mobility can defeat one head-on. For example, both variants of the .96 Gal overpower and slightly outrange the Kensa Glooga Dualies, while both variants of the Squeezer's burst fire mode outrange it. Both variants of the Dualie Squelchers match the Kensa Glooga Dualies' range and can outmaneuver it with dodge rolling and with roll jumping.",
    "- Users of long-ranged weapons, such as chargers and other splatlings, outrange an opposing Kensa Glooga Dualies user and can fire upon them with impunity. Chargers can also predict where a Kensa Glooga Dualies user will be after a roll and splat them before they can fire. This can especially be taken advantage of because of the Kensa Glooga Dualies' long endlag. However, once the Kensa Glooga Dualies gets close, it can outmaneuver and outdraw its less mobile, slower firing opponent.",
    "- An opponent's Fizzy Bomb is often a hindrance, but it can be worked around:\nShaking Fizzy Bombs for multiple explosions takes time and effort that makes the Kensa Glooga Dualies user busy, exploiting that time to engage the opponent can be tricky but can be rewarding if approached successfully or from an unnoticed direction.\nFizzy Bombs prevent pathways with their splash damage hits, taking different route or higher platforms to engage can help break choke points or bomb spam.\nFizzy Bomb takes 60% ink consumption from the ink tank (when used without Ink Saver (Sub)), paying attention to when one or two were thrown can help ease battles against the Kensa Glooga Dualies user when they are low on ink and unable to respond.",
    "- Keep an eye on the HUD to know when an opposing Kensa Glooga Dualies user has Ink Armor ready to use, and both watch and listen for when it is activated.\nThe best way to prevent the opponents from using Ink Armor is to splat their Kensa Glooga Dualies user (or any other Ink Armor-equipped weapon wielder). A charger user can prioritize said opponent when sniping, or a slayer can attempt to pick off a lone Kensa Glooga Dualies.\nFight fire with fire by having and using Ink Armor to counter the opposing Kensa Glooga Dualies user's Armor. Skirmishes between armored teams will depend on when each Ink Armor was activated, the players' skill and positioning, turf control, and the availability of other specials.\nSpecial weapons that contest space, such as Bomb Launcher and Ink Storm, can also stall an opposing Ink Armored push.\nInk Armor can negate up to 30 HP of damage, so there are a few main and sub weapons that can remove an opponent's Ink Armor in one hit:\nFor example, all variants of the Splattershot, the Splattershot Pro, and the Tri-Slosher all inflict at least 30 HP of damage per shot and fire relatively rapidly. All variants of the Splash-o-matic and the Dualie Squelchers can also accomplish this with enough Main Power Up.\nObject Shredder triples damage inflicted onto armored opponents, allowing weapons that cannot otherwise inflict 30 HP of damage to break an opponent's Ink Armor in one hit.[5] Combining Object Shredder with Ink Storm can nearly neutralize armored pushes by the opponent.\nThe splash damage of most bombs will destroy the Ink Armor of opponents who have no Bomb Defense Up DX equipped.[6][7]\nOtherwise, focus fire on armored opponents for longer than usual - preferably while ganging up on one opponent at a time - to compensate for their armor.",
    "Gear abilities provide different effects in battle that benefit the player with their equipped weapon. This is a guide to gear abilities in relation to the weapon. Strategy, synergy, viability, and purpose may be written here.",
    "A Kensa Glooga Dualies user in a slayer role generally gets close enough to the opponent and their bombs. Ever since its introduction in Version 4.3.0, Bomb Defense Up DX will not only reduce the damage taken from opposing sub and special weapons that are not one-hit-splat but will also reduce the duration of the tracking effects of certain opponent's sub and special weapons, such as Point Sensors and Ink Mines, allowing the user of this ability to evade detection more easily. Just three ability points, or one sub, offer plenty of utility:[5][6]",
    "- The splash damage of most bombs is reduced from 30 HP to 28.6 HP. This reduction in damage provides two benefits:\nIt prevents its user from being exposed on their opponents' map by the splash damage of most single bombs.\nInk Armor will not break due to splash damage from a single bomb whose splash damage normally inflicts 30 HP of damage.",
    "- The splash damage of near-misses from either Tenta Missiles or Inkjet, the minimum splash damage of bubbles, and the collision damage from Baller are all reduced from 50 HP to 48.3 HP, enabling one to survive two hits from any of these specific means of special weapon damage.",
    "Any good slayer like a Kensa Glooga Dualies user is expected to come in contact with the opponent's ink on various surfaces, which can both be damaging and reduce mobility. Ink Resistance Up not only partially offsets the reduction in mobility but also delays the damage taken from contact with opposing ink.[5][6]",
    "- Just three ability points, or one sub,…\n…delays the damage taken from opposing ink by 10 frames.\n…reduces the damage taken from 0.3 HP/f (health points per frame) to 0.2 HP/f.\n…lowers the limit on the amount of damage opposing ink on surfaces can inflict from 40 HP to 38 HP.\n…increases the normal running speed in opposing ink from 0.24 DU/f to 0.33 DU/f.[8]\n…increases the jumping height in opposing ink from 0.8 to 0.854.[7]",
    "- Six ability point, or two subs,…\n…delays the damage taken from opposing ink by 15 frames.\n…reduces the damage taken to 0.2 HP/f.\n…lowers the damage limit of opposing ink to 36.2 HP.\n…increases the normal running speed in opposing ink to 0.39 DU/f.[8]\n…increases the jumping height in opposing ink to 0.888.[7]",
    "Last-Ditch Effort is a Headgear-exclusive ability that, under specific conditions, grants its user 1 to 24 ability points each of the following abilities:",
    "- Ink Saver (Main)",
    "- Ink Saver (Sub)",
    "- Ink Recovery Up",
    "These abilities only begin to take effect under either of the following conditions:",
    "- There are at most 30 seconds remaining on the game clock, or Overtime has begun in a Ranked Battle, at which the maximum 24 ability points will be granted for each of the above abilities.",
    "- In a Ranked Battle, the opposing team's countdown has at most 50 points remaining. The effects of Last-Ditch Effort increase as the opposing team's countdown decreases from 50 to 30 points remaining, starting with 1 ability point for each ability and maxing out to 24 ability points.",
    "The Kensa Glooga Dualies can greatly benefit from the reduced ink consumption of both the main and sub weapon, allowing the user to spam Fizzy Bombs during either a crucial defensive stand or a late attempt to reclaim the lead.[5]",
    "Main Power Up increases the damage output for the Kensa Glooga Dualies, allowing for more reliable splats",
    "- 26 ability points, achieved with two mains and two subs, increases the damage of the normal shot damage to 40.8 and turret mode damage to 59.5, combining to 100.3 damage, allowing users to splat opponents with only one other hit after hitting someone in turret mode.",
    "Special Charge Up accelerates building up the special gauge for Ink Armor. Since farming Ink Armor is one of a few roles of the Kensa Glooga Dualies, constantly having Ink Armor available for teammates ensures more successful pushes and counter-pushes.[5]",
    "- Just six ability points, or two subs, are enough to reduce the special gauge requirement from 180p to 171p."
