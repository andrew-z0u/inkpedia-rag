Its handle is neon yellow, with the rim between the tank and mallet face on blue. The mallet face and ink tank change color with the user's ink. Debossed on the front of the mallet face is a pattern cropped from the outline of the SquidForce logo - specifically the variant with eyes which is used as the Regular Battle logo. This portion of the weapon acts as the face of the 'stamp', leaving an ink pattern on the floor when used. A white, glossy band around the handle has the Nouveau logo, while the ink tank has the Octopus Oil logo and the Nouveau logo debossed.\n\nA single swing of the Ultra Stamp with  leaves behind a pattern of ink identical to the logo on its front, as it is the pattern 'stamped' onto the ground. Continuous swings of the stamp by holding  causes the stamped patterns left behind to somewhat blend together, though still leaving gaps in the pattern. When thrown with , a medium-sized circle of ink is left with a very fine splatter on the edges, and when swung in the air, a short line of ink is left on the ground beneath it. The line of ink left on the ground changes length based on when in the jump the swing is performed, and the direction the player is looking.\n\n- Logos on the Stamp\n\n- Ink left by the Stamp. From left to right - one swing, continuous swings, thrown, two aerial swings\n\nThe Ultra Stamp was announced on 29 October 2018. It was released on 7 November 2018 as part of Version 4.2.0.\n\nWhen activated, the player holds a gigantic plastic mallet in front of them, which continuously stamps ink on the floor while running and provides almost total cover from the front while leaving the back exposed. Take note that in the few frames that the stamp is swinging in the air, the player is still vulnerable from the front and can be splatted. Pressing  swings the mallet and strikes it on the floor, and holding it down lets the player move forward quickly while splatting enemies in the way. Turning is fairly slow in this state. In the air, players can press the attack button to swing the mallet once at high speed, which is a smaller yet fairly efficient attack for splatting opponents directly, while pressing  throws the mallet and ends the special prematurely. Players cannot ride a Ride rail while using an Ultra Stamp. If a player equips one while riding one, they fall off the rail.\n\nEquipping Special Power Up with Ultra Stamp increases its duration.\n\n- ▲ When holding  to attack repeatedly, the number of possible attacks has been increased by shortening the amount of time the stamp is cocked back, making it easier to block shots from directly in front of you.\n\n- ▲ Increased player movement and rotation speed when holding  to attack repeatedly.\n\n- ▲ Enhanced move speed and turning speed when continuously stamping by holding down the  button.\n\n- ▲ Minimum damage of the shockwave generated while continuously stamping by holding down the  button: 30.0 → 40.0\n\n- ▲ While continuously stamping by holding down the  button, the effect of enemy bullet and bomb destruction has been extended to also cover the area around the Ultra Stamp.\n\n- ▲ Reduced the time between swinging in the air and continuously stamping by 4/60 of a second.\n\n- ▲ When swinging the hammer to smash the ground, decreased the amount of time required to complete the first swing, and the time required to raise the hammer overhead for the second swing by roughly 2/60 of a second each.\n\n- Promotional image.\n\n- Holding the Ultra Stamp.\n\n- Smashing the Ultra Stamp on the ground.\n\n- Running while using the Ultra Stamp.\n\n- Swinging the Ultra Stamp in the air.\n\n- The Ultra Stamp's imprint on the ground.\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S2_Ultra_Stamp_Promo_Video1.mp4\n\n\nDemonstration video (link to file)\n\n- Teaser image from Version 4.1.0.\n\n- Promotional image showing the Ultra Stamp's structure on the right.\n\n- Artwork for Koshien 2020\n\nThe Ultra Stamp returns in Splatoon 3. The radius of shock waves created from stamping have been increased, turning when repeatedly stamping is now quicker, and the Ultra Stamp now becomes transparent to the user when repeatedly stamping.\n\nIt appears in five Return of the Mammalians missions:\n\n- 0000 After Alterna\n\n- 0603 Torture Tour\n\n- 0612 Enter the Stamp Gauntlet\n\n- Rocket 02 Alterna Space Center Hangar\n\n- Rocket 04 The Spirit Lifter: Steerage\n\nEquipping Special Power Up with Ultra Stamp increases its duration.\n\n- ▲ Throw direct hit damage: 120 → 220.\n\n- — Fixed an issue where the Ultra Stamp would not block enemy bombs' blast waves.\n\n- — Fixed an issue where the Ultra Stamp would not block fully charged shots from a charger.\n\n- — Fixed an issue with the repeated stamping attack where there would be moments in which direct attacks could not deal damage to the opponent.\n\n- — Fixed an issue that would prevent the repeated stamping attack from properly inking the ground.\n\n- — Fixed an issue that allowed the repeated stamping attack to deal damage to enemies on the other side of thin walls.\n\n- — Fixed an issue where the midair spinning attack could not deal damage to opponents on the ground.\n\n- — Fixed an issue that allowed the midair spinning attack to deal damage to enemies on the other side of thin walls.\n\n- — Fixed an issue where hitting terrain at the instant the Ultra Stamp is thrown would cause an explosion in a different location than where it hit.\n\n- — Fixed an issue where the throw attack, when aimed at an opponent on iron grating, would deal direct damage even if hitting from the back side.\n\n- ▲ Damage dealt to Crab Tank armor increased by about 3x.\nRush mode: 1.5x → 4.5x.\nDirect hit: 1.091x → 3.273x.\nExplosion: 2x → 6x.\n\n- Rush mode: 1.5x → 4.5x.\n\n- Direct hit: 1.091x → 3.273x.\n\n- Explosion: 2x → 6x.\n\n- — The sound effect when activating is now less audible to teammates.\n\n- Rush mode: 1.5x → 4.5x.\n\n- Direct hit: 1.091x → 3.273x.\n\n- Explosion: 2x → 6x.\n\n- ▲ Increased the radius of the area where a player can be damaged from the shock waves of continuous stamp attacks by roughly 43%: 2.8 units → 4 units.\n\n- ▲ Improved the turning performance when doing continuous stamp attacks, making it easier to change direction.\n\n- ▲ When doing continuous stamp attacks, the stamp will now be displayed as translucent on the user's screen, making it easier for them to see where they're going.\n\n- ▼ Shortened the effect duration by approximately 1.5 seconds when not equipped with the Special Power Up gear ability: 9s → 7.5s\nThe effect duration gained from equipping the maximum number of Special Power Up gear abilities will not change.\n\n- The effect duration gained from equipping the maximum number of Special Power Up gear abilities will not change.\n\n- ▲ Made it easier to activate the effect from the Special Power Up gear ability, even when the player only has a few items with that gear ability equipped.\n\n- The effect duration gained from equipping the maximum number of Special Power Up gear abilities will not change.\n\n- ▲ Increased the damage dealt by the explosion at the point of impact when the stamp is thrown in the following ways.\nIncreased the damage dealt to opponents near the center of the explosion from 60.0 to 220.0.\nIncreased the damage dealt to opponents further from the center of the explosion from 30.0 to 60.0.\n\n- Increased the damage dealt to opponents near the center of the explosion from 60.0 to 220.0.\n\n- Increased the damage dealt to opponents further from the center of the explosion from 30.0 to 60.0.\n\n- Increased the damage dealt to opponents near the center of the explosion from 60.0 to 220.0.\n\n- Increased the damage dealt to opponents further from the center of the explosion from 30.0 to 60.0.\n\nWining a certain number of battles with the Ultra Stamp will reward the player with special badges that they can use on their Splashtag.\n\n- An earlier version of the Ultra Stamp icon.\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- 2D icon used in Side Order\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Ultra Stamp.\n\n- A less cropped version of the Tableturf card icon.\n\n- Promotional screenshot\n\nFor competitive tips about the Ultra Stamp\n\n- Preliminary versions of Ultra Stamp were found by data miners starting with Version 4.0.0, under the code name \"SuperStamp\".\n\n- The Ultra Stamp was shown in the Version 4.0.0 trailer, but neither the Kensa Octobrush nor the Kensa L-3 Nozzlenose were made available until Version 4.2.0.\n\n- Almost every weapon with Ultra Stamp in Splatoon 2 has a 180p special gauge. The exception is the Tenta Camo Brella with 210. Up until Version 4.1.0, this was also true for Splatoon 3 until the Mini Splatling got nerfed to 190.\n\n- There was an exploit in which a player could build up momentum with the Ultra Stamp to make major shortcuts in multiple stages. This exploit caused numerous problems in matches, including excessive base invasion. Starfish Mainstage was temporarily removed from the stage rotation while the bug underwent fixing.\n\n- There is another exploit in which Ultra Stamps can be thrown through certain walls. This glitch requires a wall directly in front of the player and one to the right, forming a corner. By continuously walking into the corner and pointing the camera at the correct angle, the Ultra Stamp can be thrown through the wall. This still works as of Version 5.5.0.\n\n- If an Ultra Stamp is thrown at an open Undercover Brella, the canopy will break and the stamp will explode. Sometimes, the stamp will go through the brella and splat the user. However, in some cases they will be protected from all damage.\n\n- The Ultra Stamp and Booyah Bomb are the two least common special weapons in Splatoon 2, with each only appearing in five weapon sets."
