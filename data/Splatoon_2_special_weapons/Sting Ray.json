It fires an infinite-range ink beam that can shoot through walls.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Splatoon 2\n\n2.1 Special Power Up\n2.2 Version history\n2.3 Quotes\n2.4 Sets\n2.5 Gallery\n2.6 Demonstration\n\n- 2.1 Special Power Up\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Sets\n\n- 2.5 Gallery\n\n- 2.6 Demonstration\n\n- 3 Strategy\n\n- 4 Splatoon 3\n\n- 5 Trivia\n\n- 6 Etymology\n\n6.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 6.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 2.1 Special Power Up\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Sets\n\n- 2.5 Gallery\n\n- 2.6 Demonstration\n\n- 6.1 Names in other languages\n\nThe Sting Ray consists of two parts, a handle and a tank, as well as the ink beam. The tank is mainly red with a stripe at the bottom that changes color to match the user's ink. A small sticker bearing the Custom logo can be seen on the tank's bottom, and the letters in the Custom logo are painted in white across the tank. Attached to the back of the tank is a large gray motor with a tube sticking out of it. Said tube connects the handle to the tank. The handle is also mainly red with highlights in the user's ink color. Sticking out of the handle's front is a large gray nozzle. The beam of ink that is shot by the Sting Ray is colored completely in that of the user's ink. The beam itself is fairly thin, but after firing for a few seconds, it gains some large shockwaves around it. Said shockwaves are very similar in appearance to those shot out of a Killer Wail.\n\nWhen activated, it allows the player to fire a continuous ink laser that pierces through obstacles. To balance this, there is a 0.7 second delay after the player presses  before the laser fires and the turning when firing is slow, though the player can stop firing it to quickly re-aim it in the camera's direction.\n\nWhen the Sting Ray is active but not fired, the player can see white silhouettes of opponents through opaque obstacles as if Thermal Ink or Haunt were active, assisting the player to locate opponents for Sting Ray splats. The silhouettes also temporarily disappear if the player is within a certain distance from the opponent (Bomb Defense Up DX increases this minimum distance) or the opponent submerges in ink.\n\nThe Sting Ray's laser deals 1.8 damage per frame while it makes contact with an opponent. While it has excellent range and can hurt players hiding behind cover, the Sting Ray's beam is narrow. After 1.5 seconds of being continuously fired (starting from the moment  is held down), the Sting Ray's beam gets wider. This is reset after the player stops firing or turns into a squid or octopus.\n\nIt appears in 4 Octo Canyon missions:\n\n- Sunset Octocopter (Mission #3)\n\n- Enter the Octohurler (Mission #4)\n\n- Octozeppelin Invasion (Mission #6)\n\n- Octolings Ahoy! (Mission #21)\n\nEquipping Special Power Up with Sting Ray increases its duration.\n\n- ▲ Buffed compared to the Sting Ray in the Splatoon 2 Global Testfire. Players can now stop firing the beam and can see Inklings and Octolings through walls.\n\n- ▲ Firing the Sting Ray continuously for 1.5 seconds will cause a shock wave to appear around the ink blast, significantly increasing its damage radius.\n\n- ▲ Extended firing duration by .5 seconds (firing duration when using the maximum amount of Special Power Up remains unchanged).\n\n- ▲ Ink splats will no longer appear on players submerged in ink when hit by a Sting Ray fired by one of their allies.\n\n- ▲ Opponents behind stage objects will be revealed when the Sting Ray's beam is roughly 23% further away from them than it was previously.\n\n- ▲ Increased damage dealt to opposing Ballers when shooting ink by roughly 100%.\n\n- ▼ Reduced the duration of the beam effect by roughly 15/60 of a second.\n\n- ▼ Reduced damage dealt by roughly 10%.\n\n- ▼ Players will now be pushed out of the spawn point's barrier when using Sting Ray from inside the barrier.\n\n- ▼ Now blocked not only by the opponent's spawn point barrier, but also by the barrier of user's spawn point as well.\n\n- ▼ Decreased duration by roughly 35/60 of a second.\n\n- ▼ Decreased effect granted by the Special Power Up gear ability.\n\n- ▼ Decreased damage dealt to opponents using Ink Armor by roughly 56%.\n\n- ▼ Decreased damage dealt to opponents using a Baller by roughly 25%.\n\n- ▼ Decreased ability to knock back opponents using a Baller.\n\n- ▼ While shooting by pressing , silhouette displayed by effects such as Thermal Ink will disappear altogether.\n\n- ▼ Decreased damage dealt to opponents when the Sting Ray's beam passes through at least one stage object before hitting them by roughly 17%.\n\n- ▼ Decreased the additional damage dealt to opponent Ink Armor when the Object Shredder gear ability is equipped from roughly 3.0 times normal to roughly 1.25 times normal damage.\n\n- Sting Ray\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- An Inkling using the Sting Ray.\n\n- Aiming the Sting Ray\n\n- Firing the Sting Ray\n\n- Holding the Sting Ray\n\n- A player firing the Sting Ray in the Training Room. The Sting Ray has developed a shockwave after firing for some time.\n\n- A player firing the Sting Ray in the Training Room.

However, the Stinger Boss Salmonid still makes use of it, and several bosses in Splatoon 3: Side Order use a modified thinner version.\n\nIn Side Order, the Sting Ray uses a texture resembling glitchy blocks of color. This is due to how it is an attack used by Overlorder in its boss fight, in its original beam form sans shockwave. The Asynchronous Rondo boss also uses Sting Ray-esque beams that slowly track the player's vertical position as an attack.\n\n- Sting Ray is made by the Custom brand.\n\n- The Sting Ray appears to be based on a pressure washer, particularly a gas powered one, hinted at by the ambient sounds the weapon makes when not firing.\n\n- In one of her conversations with Callie in Tentakeel Outpost, Marie's nickname for activating the Sting Ray when the Tower is almost at the goal is \"SHINING VICTORY BEEEEEEEEAM\".\n\n- The Stinger is a Boss Salmonid whose attack emulates the Sting Ray.\n\nSting Ray is a reference to the real-life marine animal of the same name. It could also be a reference to a ray gun, which would shoot a laser-like projectile."
