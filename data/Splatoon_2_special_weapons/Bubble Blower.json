Said bubble wand is simply a black stick with a large, flimsy, circular part with bubble material in it at the top. There is a canister of bubble material attached to the wand that changes color to match the user's ink. The bubbles that are blown with the wand are transparent with swirls of the user's ink in them. The more the user or the user's teammates shoot the bubbles, the larger they grow and the more ink is put into them. The more the opposing team shoots the bubbles, the smaller they grow and the more ink is removed from them.\n\nThe Bubble Blower allows players to create three large bubbles. The bubbles slowly move and bounce in the direction the player fired them. As the bubbles move, they grow when hit by the user's ink and shrink when hit by the opposing team's ink. If the player or their team pops the bubble, a lethal blast of ink splats any enemy close to the bubble and inks the area. If too much time passes without a bubble being popped, or if the enemy pops one, it fizzles away without a deadly blast of ink.\n\nEquipping Special Power Up with Bubbler Blower increases the size and blast radius of the bubbles.\n\nBubble damage:\n\n- Damage values: 250, 50.\n\n- Touch damage: 0.5 per frame\n\n- Special use duration: 8 seconds.\n\n- Bubble max duration: 14 seconds.\n\n- Bubble HP for allies: 400 HP.\nHP doubled for enemies.\n\n- HP doubled for enemies.\n\n- For allies, bubbles take 40 damage per second while they heal that amount for enemies instead. However, bubbles can only be popped if they are attacked.\n\n- Allies deal 20% more damage to their own team's bubbles.\n\n- Enemies deal more damage to shrunken bubbles.\n\n- Object Shredder: Increases damage the bubble deals to objects, and increases damage dealt to the bubble by 30%.\n\n- HP doubled for enemies.\n\n- ▲ Increased damage dealt to the bubbles by allied players by roughly 20%, making them easier to burst.\n\n- ▲ Decreased time to switch back to main weapon after creating three bubbles by 20/60 of a second.\n\n- ▲ Increased damage dealt to opposing Ballers by roughly 100%.\n\n- ▼ Bubbles from the Bubble Blower that burst after the end of a match will no longer ink the stage.\n\n- — Fixed an issue causing movement speed while firing the Bubble Blower to vary depending on which main weapon was equipped.\n\n- ▼ Made it easier for bubbles to be popped by opponents' attacks when they have shrunken by a certain amount.\n\n- ▼ Decreased the radius within which 250.0 damage is dealt by roughly 8%.\n\n- ▼ Decreased amount of time before bubbles disappear on their own by 6 seconds.\n\n- ▲ Painting radius when bubbles touch the ground increased by about 8%.\n\n- ▲ Firing interval when in human form shortened by about 5/60 of a second.\n\n- ▲ Special Power Up effectiveness increased with fewer gear slots.\n\n- ▲ Extended the time until a bubble pops naturally by roughly 2 seconds.\n\n- ▼ Reduced the size of the first and second bubbles.\n\n- The first bubble is the smallest, the second is slightly larger, and the third bubble onward will be the same size as before.\n\n- The area over which damage is dealt and the area which is inked by an exploding bubble depends on the size of the bubble.\n\nThese bubbles will shrivel up if hit by enemy ink.\n\n- Official render of the Bubble Blower.\n\n- An Inkling firing the Bubble Blower.\n\n- Bubbles at their normal size.\n\n- Bubbles with one main and three subs of Special Power Up.\n\n- Bubbles with two mains and six subs of Special Power Up.\n\n- Bubbles with three mains and nine subs of Special Power Up.\n\n- Render\n\nFor competitive tips about the Bubble Blower\n\n- The Bubble Blower was the first special weapon in the Splatoon franchise to have been added post-release.\nIt was, however, given an official description in-game with the initial release, confirming it would be added, unlike the Booyah Bomb and Ultra Stamp.\n\n- It was, however, given an official description in-game with the initial release, confirming it would be added, unlike the Booyah Bomb and Ultra Stamp.\n\n- It was, however, given an official description in-game with the initial release, confirming it would be added, unlike the Booyah Bomb and Ultra Stamp."
