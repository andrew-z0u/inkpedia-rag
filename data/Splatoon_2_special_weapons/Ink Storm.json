    "The Ink Storm is a special weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3. It is a thrown canister that summons a cloud that rains down ink within a large radius.",
    "When activated, the Ink Storm gives the user a large capsule that they hold above their head. Said capsule is cylindrical and has four metal fins sticking out of it with grips that change color to match the user's ink. The body of the capsule also changes color to match the user's ink, and there are four metal attachments sticking out the back. When the capsule hits something after being thrown, it breaks into pieces and releases a cloud up into the sky that changes color to match the user's ink. The cloud travels in the direction it was thrown while raining ink onto the ground below it. The area where the ink falls is indicated via a ring of the user's ink color.",
    "After landing, the Ink Storm creates a rain cloud that gradually drifts forward above the map, raining down drops of ink that damage all opponents in the cloud's radius. An Ink Storm's cloud will not paint ground nor hurt enemies that are too far below it. It will also not hurt opponents above the cloud or underneath cover. After being thrown, the special gauge will drain, and the player must wait until the gauge is empty before they can charge their special again.",
