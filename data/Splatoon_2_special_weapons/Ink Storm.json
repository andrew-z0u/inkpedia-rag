Said capsule is cylindrical and has four metal fins sticking out of it with grips that change color to match the user's ink. The body of the capsule also changes color to match the user's ink, and there are four metal attachments sticking out the back. When the capsule hits something after being thrown, it breaks into pieces and releases a cloud up into the sky that changes color to match the user's ink. The cloud travels in the direction it was thrown while raining ink onto the ground below it. The area where the ink falls is indicated via a ring of the user's ink color.\n\nAfter landing, the Ink Storm creates a rain cloud that gradually drifts forward above the map, raining down drops of ink that damage all opponents in the cloud's radius. An Ink Storm's cloud will not paint ground nor hurt enemies that are too far below it. It will also not hurt opponents above the cloud or underneath cover. After being thrown, the special gauge will drain, and the player must wait until the gauge is empty before they can charge their special again.\n\nThe cloud produced by Ink Storm can block a player's sight if they are level with or above the cloud.\n\nIt appears in four Octo Canyon missions:\n\n- Parking Garage (Mission #14)\n\n- Underground Expressway (Mission #22)\n\n- Platform Madhouse (Mission #25)\n\n- Paradise Lanes (Mission #26)\n\nEquipping Special Power Up with Ink Storm increases its throwing speed and duration when active.\n\n- ▲ Increased radius of affect by roughly 13%.\n▲ Area radius: 80 → 90 units.\n▲ Drops paint radius: 18 → 20.25 units.\n\n- ▲ Area radius: 80 → 90 units.\n\n- ▲ Drops paint radius: 18 → 20.25 units.\n\n- ▲ Decreased points required to use the Ink Storm special for most main weapons it is paired with.\n\n- ▲ Area radius: 80 → 90 units.\n\n- ▲ Drops paint radius: 18 → 20.25 units.\n\n- ▲ Increased damage dealt to opposing Ballers by the storm by roughly 150%: 1 → 2.5 multiplier.\n\n- — Fixed an issue causing the predicted range of the sub weapon to incorrectly display when readying an Ink Storm special while also equipped with either a Point Sensor or Toxic Mist sub weapon (Splattershot Pro or Rapid Blaster Pro).\n\n- — Fixed an issue causing the inking effect of an Ink Storm special to occur unnaturally when the storm intersected with a roof or other similar object in a stage.\n\n- ▼ Reduced the frequency with which it inks the ground by roughly 20% : 240 → 192 drops.\n\n- ▼ Decreased area of effect radius by roughly 6%.\n▼ Area radius: 90 → 85 units.\n▼ Drops paint radius: 20.25 → 19.125 units.\n\n- ▼ Area radius: 90 → 85 units.\n\n- ▼ Drops paint radius: 20.25 → 19.125 units.\n\n- ▼ Area radius: 90 → 85 units.\n\n- ▼ Drops paint radius: 20.25 → 19.125 units.\n\n- Ink Storm promotional image\n\n- The Ink Storm as it is pouring ink on the map and splatting enemy Inklings in Starfish Mainstage.\n\n- The Ink Storm's cloud as viewed from the ground.\n\n- An Inkling preparing to throw the Ink Storm itself.\n\n- An Inkling girl holding an Ink Storm.\n\nThe Ink Storm returns in Splatoon 3. The device now produces a single cloud that becomes transparent when players are level with or above it. It also increases the rate of recovering damage for the player's team, even while not submerged in ink.\n\nIt appears in four Return of the Mammalians missions:\n\n- 0000 After Alterna\n\n- 0301 Climbing the Corporate Splatter\n\n- 0601 Bet You Mist Us!\n\n- Rocket 02 Alterna Space Center Hangar\n\nEquipping Special Power Up with Ink Storm increases its throwing speed and duration when active.\n\n- ▲ Damage taken while within the area of effect of your own team's Ink Storm will recover more quickly, even when not submerged in ink.\n\n- The ring border effect seen in the Ink Storm's area of effect has been slightly altered.\n\n- ▲ Increased the radius of the area of effect by approximately 18%: 8.5 units → 10 units.\n\nWinning a certain number of battles with the Ink Storm will reward the player with special badges that they can use on their Splashtag.\n\n- An earlier version of the Ink Storm icon.\n\n- 2D icon.\n\n- 2D icon used in Side Order\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Ink Storm.\n\n- Uncropped version of the Tableturf card icon.\n\n- Player observing an Ink Storm in the sky\n\n- The Ink Storm's border effect in action as seen up until version 8.1.0\n\n- The Ink Storm's border effect post-version 9.0.0\n\nFor competitive tips about the Ink Storm\n\n- The throwable capsule is based on a sea hare, a mollusk known for releasing clouds of ink when disturbed.\n\n- Drizzlers attack by creating rainclouds of ink very similar to an Ink Storm.\n\n- Ink Storm and Tenta Missiles were absent from the Splatoon 3 Splatfest World Premiere.\n\n- Ink Storm is the only weapon that can directly affect the healing rate of the player."
