    "The Inkjet is a special weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3. It temporarily equips the user with an ink-propelled jetpack and an explosive long-ranged ink cannon.",
    "The Inkjet consists of two parts: a jetpack and a cannon. The jetpack has what appears to be a plastic water or soda bottle filled with the user's ink connected to a large gray tube and a metal device. Said device has two more tubes, one on the left side and one on the right, that face downwards and excrete ink that allows the user to hover in the air. A gray harness wraps around the user's body. The cannon changes color to match the user's ink with a dark gray nozzle. The trigger is positioned below the main body inside of a handle that the user puts their arm around. The icon that appears on the Inkjet's recall point is a small depiction of the Inkjet's jetpack. The lines are white and the whole icon is shaded with a darker shade of the user's ink color.",
    "When activated, the player can fly about in the air and shoot blaster-like projectiles. The jet also leaves a trail of ink which comes out of the jet's exhaust and can splat enemy players. While the player is in mid-air, they can switch to squid or octopus form. Players can also press  while hovering to gain a temporary boost in height. When the special's duration ends, the player Super Jumps back to the location where they activated the Inkjet. The Inkjet's landing marker is visible to all players, much like a Super Jump marker. Unlike other specials, if the player falls off the stage, they will Super Jump back to the location where they activated the Inkjet and the special ends. When using the Inkjet, the player is unable to obtain the Rainmaker or score Power Clams.",
    "While continuously firing, the inkjet receives a movement speed reduction based on the main weapon's strafing speed.[1] Even though Inkjet users are technically flying and not running, Run Speed Up reduces the movement speed firing penalty, but it does not subsequently increase movement speed when not firing except when walking on grates.",

Its movement speed while firing is now consistent regardless of the main weapon and the amount of Run Speed Up the user has equipped. Because of post-launch updates, the boost after pressing  is now a bit higher, and the explosive shot's 50 damage radius is bigger.",
