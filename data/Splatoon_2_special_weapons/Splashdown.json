    "The Splashdown is a special weapon in Splatoon 2 and Return of the Mammalians in Splatoon 3. It creates a blast zone around the user that damages enemies within range.",
    "The Splashdown, when activated, coats the user in their ink and makes their right fist larger. Some rings then appear where the Splashdown will land. Upon landing, the Splashdown creates a cylinder of ink with some ink splashing out at the edges. Said cylinder spreads outwards until it reaches its maximum diameter.",
    "The player using the Splashdown strikes the ground with heavy force, causing an ink explosion around them. Using it on the ground causes the player to jump up with a short delay, but it can also be used from the air or during a Super Jump. If the player is splatted while in the air, they only get a 25% special gauge penalty, or 40% if the opponent has Respawn Punisher or Haunt.",
    "A player using Splashdown is briefly vulnerable to attacks. Similar to the Ink Armor, the player can be splatted before the activation animation is finished. The weapon is more effective in the air, while the player is Super Jumping. A radius displays when the Splashdown is used; this radius indicates the weapon's one-hit-splat range. Opponents just outside this area still take significant damage.",

    "Equipping Special Power Up with Splashdown increases its 180 damage radius without changing its 70 damage, 55 damage, or inking radii. The following table shows the increase of its 180 damage radius when stacking the ability:",
    "- Damage values: 180, 70, 55.\n180 damage range: 0 → ~1.4 bar radius.\n70 damage range: ~1.3 → ~2.0 bar radius.\n55 damage range: ~2.1 → ~2.9 bar radius.\nHeight increases the 180 damage radius, but not any other radius.",
    "- Splashdown wind-up delay: 1.2 seconds.\nDelay decreased by 60% when used during a super jump. Down to 0.8 seconds.",
    "- Invincibility duration: 5 frames during the rise and 30 frames after landing.",

    "Splatoon 3 features the Triple Splashdown, a direct successor of the original Splashdown from Splatoon 2, though reworked to let the player be supported by two summoned fists, which will each each do Splashdowns after the player's.\nThe original Splashdown does not return in any multiplayer modes in Splatoon 3. However, it does appear in the Return of the Mammalians single-player campaign as Agent 3's default special weapon while using the Hero Suit. It can be used after filling the special gauge but gets temporarily replaced if a canned special weapon is collected. Like in Splatoon 2, the player jumps in the air and lands on the ground, causing a heavy ink explosion around them, but the special can no longer be used during a Super Jump.",
    "It is also available in one level outside of the Hero Suit:",
