It creates a blast zone around the user that damages enemies within range.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Splatoon 2\n\n2.1 Special Power Up\n2.2 Data\n2.3 Version history\n2.4 Quotes\n2.5 Sets\n2.6 Gallery\n2.7 Demonstration\n\n- 2.1 Special Power Up\n\n- 2.2 Data\n\n- 2.3 Version history\n\n- 2.4 Quotes\n\n- 2.5 Sets\n\n- 2.6 Gallery\n\n- 2.7 Demonstration\n\n- 3 Splatoon 3\n\n3.1 Version history\n\n- 3.1 Version history\n\n- 4 Strategy\n\n- 5 Trivia\n\n- 6 Names in other languages\n\n6.1 Translation notes\n\n- 6.1 Translation notes\n\n- 7 References\n\n- 2.1 Special Power Up\n\n- 2.2 Data\n\n- 2.3 Version history\n\n- 2.4 Quotes\n\n- 2.5 Sets\n\n- 2.6 Gallery\n\n- 2.7 Demonstration\n\n- 3.1 Version history\n\n- 6.1 Translation notes\n\nThe Splashdown, when activated, coats the user in their ink and makes their right fist larger. Some rings then appear where the Splashdown will land. Upon landing, the Splashdown creates a cylinder of ink with some ink splashing out at the edges. Said cylinder spreads outwards until it reaches its maximum diameter.\n\nThe player using the Splashdown strikes the ground with heavy force, causing an ink explosion around them. Using it on the ground causes the player to jump up with a short delay, but it can also be used from the air or during a Super Jump. If the player is splatted while in the air, they only get a 25% special gauge penalty, or 40% if the opponent has Respawn Punisher or Haunt.\n\nA player using Splashdown is briefly vulnerable to attacks. Similar to the Ink Armor, the player can be splatted before the activation animation is finished. The weapon is more effective in the air, while the player is Super Jumping. A radius displays when the Splashdown is used; this radius indicates the weapon's one-hit-splat range. Opponents just outside this area still take significant damage.\n\nSplashdown is one of the four obtainable special weapons in Salmon Run.\n\nIt appears in 3 Octo Canyon missions:\n\n- Welcome to Octopia (Mission #2)\n\n- Octoling Assault (Mission #15)\n\n- Underground Expressway (Mission #22)\n\nEquipping Special Power Up with Splashdown increases its 180 damage radius without changing its 70 damage, 55 damage, or inking radii. The following table shows the increase of its 180 damage radius when stacking the ability:\n\n- Damage values: 180, 70, 55.\n180 damage range: 0 → ~1.4 bar radius.\n70 damage range: ~1.3 → ~2.0 bar radius.\n55 damage range: ~2.1 → ~2.9 bar radius.\nHeight increases the 180 damage radius, but not any other radius.\n\n- 180 damage range: 0 → ~1.4 bar radius.\n\n- 70 damage range: ~1.3 → ~2.0 bar radius.\n\n- 55 damage range: ~2.1 → ~2.9 bar radius.\n\n- Height increases the 180 damage radius, but not any other radius.\n\n- Splashdown wind-up delay: 1.2 seconds.\nDelay decreased by 60% when used during a super jump. Down to 0.8 seconds.\n\n- Delay decreased by 60% when used during a super jump. Down to 0.8 seconds.\n\n- Invincibility duration: 5 frames during the rise and 30 frames after landing.\n\n- 180 damage range: 0 → ~1.4 bar radius.\n\n- 70 damage range: ~1.3 → ~2.0 bar radius.\n\n- 55 damage range: ~2.1 → ~2.9 bar radius.\n\n- Height increases the 180 damage radius, but not any other radius.\n\n- Delay decreased by 60% when used during a super jump. Down to 0.8 seconds.\n\n- ▲ Decreased amount of time the player remains at the peak height of their jump by 10/60 of a second.\n\n- ▲ Increased the peak height of the Splashdown jump by roughly 31%.\n\n- ▲ Increased the minimum damage caused by the Splashdown: 40.0 → 55.0.\n\n- ▲ Decreased the points required to use the Splashdown special for certain main weapons it is paired with.\n\n- ▼  Dealing damage to a player mid-Splashdown will no longer depend on Internet connection quality.\n\n- ▲ Increased radius of turf inked when landing, and decreased gaps of uninked turf.\n\n- ▲ Decreased reduction of special gauge if the user is splatted in the time between activating the special but before landing with it from 50% to 25%.\n\n- ▲ Increased damage dealt by the Splashdown to bubbles fired by the Bubble Blower, ensuring that they will be destroyed if struck by it, regardless of which area of the Splashdown hits the bubble and whether or not the user is wearing Object Shredder.\n\n- ▲ Greatly increased damage dealt to opponent Brellas.\nIncreased damage to opponent Brellas varies from roughly 2 to 3.2 times the previous amount depending on the Brella.\n\n- Increased damage to opponent Brellas varies from roughly 2 to 3.2 times the previous amount depending on the Brella.\n\n- ▲ Increased damage dealt to an opponent Baller by roughly 2.5 times.\n\n- Increased damage to opponent Brellas varies from roughly 2 to 3.2 times the previous amount depending on the Brella.\n\n- ▲ Increased damage dealt to opponent Ballers by roughly 2.4 times.\n\n- ▲ Increased damage dealt to armor surrounding an opponent charging a Booyah Bomb by roughly 7.5 times.\n\n- ▲ Extended the area within which damage is dealt upward.\nThis change makes it easier to deal damage to mid-air opponents from even a moderate distance.\nThere is no change to the damage area for opponents standing near but lower than the epicenter of the blast.\n\n- This change makes it easier to deal damage to mid-air opponents from even a moderate distance.\n\n- There is no change to the damage area for opponents standing near but lower than the epicenter of the blast.\n\n- ▲ Increased damage dealt to opponent Ballers by roughly 21%.\n\n- This change makes it easier to deal damage to mid-air opponents from even a moderate distance.\n\n- There is no change to the damage area for opponents standing near but lower than the epicenter of the blast.\n\n- Splashdown titlecard\n\n- An Inkling using the Splashdown\n\n- Promotional render of Splashdown\n\n- An Inkling using the Splashdown\n\n- Agent 4 using the Splashdown\n\nSplatoon 3 features the Triple Splashdown, a direct successor of the original Splashdown from Splatoon 2, though reworked to let the player be supported by two summoned fists, which will each each do Splashdowns after the player's.\nThe original Splashdown does not return in any multiplayer modes in Splatoon 3. However, it does appear in the Return of the Mammalians single-player campaign as Agent 3's default special weapon while using the Hero Suit. It can be used after filling the special gauge but gets temporarily replaced if a canned special weapon is collected. Like in Splatoon 2, the player jumps in the air and lands on the ground, causing a heavy ink explosion around them, but the special can no longer be used during a Super Jump.\n\nIt is also available in one level outside of the Hero Suit:\n\n- 0508 Making Waves with Splashdowns.\n\n- — Fixed an issue where using a Splashdown on the edge of a cliff would cause player controls to stop working.\n\nFor competitive tips about the Splashdown\n\n- Moving or shooting after Splashdown cancels the end of the player's animation of the Special."
