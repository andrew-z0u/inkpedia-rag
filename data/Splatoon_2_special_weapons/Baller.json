It puts the user into a movable player-sized ball that protects them and can explode on command.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Splatoon 2\n\n2.1 Special Power Up\n2.2 Version history\n2.3 Quotes\n2.4 Sets\n2.5 Gallery\n\n- 2.1 Special Power Up\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Sets\n\n- 2.5 Gallery\n\n- 3 Strategy\n\n- 4 Trivia\n\n- 5 Etymology\n\n5.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 5.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 6 References\n\n- 2.1 Special Power Up\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Sets\n\n- 2.5 Gallery\n\n- 5.1 Names in other languages\n\nThe Baller is a transparent sphere that is just large enough to encase an Inkling or Octoling, reminiscent of a hamster[1] or water ball. There are two white strips of tape encircling the Baller that are ripped off when it takes enough damage. A small reservoir of the user's ink rests in the bottom of the Baller.\n\nWhen using the special, an Inkling or Octoling enters the Baller. This allows them to move quickly and blocks incoming damage taken while inking the ground as they move, and also allows them to roll up walls. If  is held while in the bubble, or after a set time, the Baller explodes, covering the surrounding area in ink. The Baller being inked results in it shrinking, eventually disappearing, instead of the player using it taking damage. The Baller works similar to Splash Wall in matters of destructive bombs. They explode immediately upon touching it, which can be disastrous for teammates nearby.\n\nIt appears in three Octo Expansion Stations:\n\n- A04 Roll Out Station\n\n- H02 Ballercise Station\n\n- J08 F11 Whack-Fu Station\n\nEquipping Special Power Up with Baller increases its durability and explosion radius. The following table shows the HP increase percentage for Baller when stacking the ability.\n\n- ▲ During use, reduced amount of damage received from opponent Shooters (excluding Blasters), Splatlings, and Dualies by 40%.\n\n- ▲ Made the Baller less likely to be knocked back when hit with enemy attacks.\n\n- ▲ Increased durability of the Baller by about 33% when the gear ability \"Special Power Up\" isn't being used. (Durability when using the maximum amount of \"Special Power Up\" remains unchanged.)\n\n- ▲ Increased damage radius of explosion by roughly 17% and radius of ink coverage by roughly 7%.\n\n- ▲ Increased minimum damage caused by explosion: 30.0 → 55.0.\n\n- ▲ Increased power of explosion to knock back opponents.\n\n- ▲ Increased damage dealt to opposing Ballers by bursting bubbles by roughly 150%.\n\n- ▼ Made movement of the Baller easier to hear for surrounding players.\n\n- ▼ Decreased the radius of minimum damage (55 damage) dealt by the explosion of the Baller by roughly 14% when Special Power Up isn't being used.\nDue to changes in gear ability balancing, this radius will be the same as it was previously when the maximum amount of Special Power Up is being used.\n\n- Due to changes in gear ability balancing, this radius will be the same as it was previously when the maximum amount of Special Power Up is being used.\n\n- Due to changes in gear ability balancing, this radius will be the same as it was previously when the maximum amount of Special Power Up is being used.\n\n- ▲ Made it so the player can change direction of movement more quickly than before.\n\n- ▲ Climbing surfaces where inkable walls connect to non-inkable walls will now be easier.\n\n- ▲ Greatly increased damage dealt to opponent Brellas.\nIncreased damage to opponent Brellas varies from roughly 3 to 4.8 times the previous amount depending on the Brella.\n\n- Increased damage to opponent Brellas varies from roughly 3 to 4.8 times the previous amount depending on the Brella.\n\n- Increased damage to opponent Brellas varies from roughly 3 to 4.8 times the previous amount depending on the Brella.\n\n- ▼ Decreased duration of active time from roughly 7 to roughly 6 seconds.\n\n- ▼ Can now be affected by Toxic Mist.\n\n- ▼ Extended the time the  Button has to be held down to trigger this by roughly 16/60 of a second: 30 frames → 46 frames.\n\n- ▲ When a weapon that has a fast walking speed when not firing or a fast squid-form swimming speed is equipped, increased acceleration on the ground to allow the player to move more quickly.\n\n- This applies to the following weapons that can use a Baller.\nAerospray RG\nLuna Blaster\nInkbrush Nouveau\nUndercover Sorella Brella\n\n- Aerospray RG\n\n- Luna Blaster\n\n- Inkbrush Nouveau\n\n- Undercover Sorella Brella\n\n- ▼ When a weapon that has a slow walking speed when not firing or a slow squid-form swimming speed is equipped, reduced maximum speed by roughly 14%.\n\n- This applies to the following weapon that can use a Baller.\nCustom Explosher\n\n- Custom Explosher\n\n- Aerospray RG\n\n- Luna Blaster\n\n- Inkbrush Nouveau\n\n- Undercover Sorella Brella\n\n- Custom Explosher\n\nThe ball will eventually explode, allowing you to use the moment you emerge from it as an attack.\n\nYou can also hold  to build up power and cause the ball to explode yourself.\n\n- Baller promotional image\n\n- An Inkling in the Baller\n\n- Agent 8 in the Baller\n\n- Render\n\n- Artwork for Koshien 2020\n\nFor competitive tips about the Baller\n\n- When a player is splatted by a Baller's explosion, a message with \"The Baller Inksploded!\" appears. The message \"Splatted by Baller!\" appears in other instances.\n\n- Baller, Splashdown, and Ink Armor are the only special weapons to appear on at least one weapon in every class.\n\n- According to The Art of Splatoon 2, researchers made the Baller to find out how to contain ink released by Inklings when they used a special weapon.\nIt was revealed that to hold all the ink, the Baller would have to be seven times its volume than the prototype, although it would become unable to roll around the stage.\nThey settled on having the Baller hold a portion of ink and releasing the rest as the user moved around inside.\n\n- It was revealed that to hold all the ink, the Baller would have to be seven times its volume than the prototype, although it would become unable to roll around the stage.\n\n- They settled on having the Baller hold a portion of ink and releasing the rest as the user moved around inside.\n\n- It was revealed that to hold all the ink, the Baller would have to be seven times its volume than the prototype, although it would become unable to roll around the stage.\n\n- They settled on having the Baller hold a portion of ink and releasing the rest as the user moved around inside.\n\n\"Baller\" is a noun form of the verbal sense of \"ball\" (to play a ball sport, particularly basketball or soccer). It can also be interpreted literally in the sense that the special encases the user in a ball (or \"balls\" them).\n\nIn the former sense of a player of e.g. basketball, it has also extended meaning to be used generally to refer to those who are particularly cool or live extravagantly."
