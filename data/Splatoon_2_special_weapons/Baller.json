    "The Baller is a special weapon in Splatoon 2. It puts the user into a movable player-sized ball that protects them and can explode on command.",
    "The Baller is a transparent sphere that is just large enough to encase an Inkling or Octoling, reminiscent of a hamster[1] or water ball. There are two white strips of tape encircling the Baller that are ripped off when it takes enough damage. A small reservoir of the user's ink rests in the bottom of the Baller.",
    "When using the special, an Inkling or Octoling enters the Baller. This allows them to move quickly and blocks incoming damage taken while inking the ground as they move, and also allows them to roll up walls. If  is held while in the bubble, or after a set time, the Baller explodes, covering the surrounding area in ink. The Baller being inked results in it shrinking, eventually disappearing, instead of the player using it taking damage. The Baller works similar to Splash Wall in matters of destructive bombs. They explode immediately upon touching it, which can be disastrous for teammates nearby.",
    "It appears in three Octo Expansion Stations:",
    "- A04 Roll Out Station",
    "- H02 Ballercise Station",
    "- J08 F11 Whack-Fu Station",
    "Equipping Special Power Up with Baller increases its durability and explosion radius. The following table shows the HP increase percentage for Baller when stacking the ability.",

    "For competitive tips about the Baller",
    "- When a player is splatted by a Baller's explosion, a message with \"The Baller Inksploded!\" appears. The message \"Splatted by Baller!\" appears in other instances.",
    "- Baller, Splashdown, and Ink Armor are the only special weapons to appear on at least one weapon in every class.",
    "- According to The Art of Splatoon 2, researchers made the Baller to find out how to contain ink released by Inklings when they used a special weapon.\nIt was revealed that to hold all the ink, the Baller would have to be seven times its volume than the prototype, although it would become unable to roll around the stage.\nThey settled on having the Baller hold a portion of ink and releasing the rest as the user moved around inside.",
    "\"Baller\" is a noun form of the verbal sense of \"ball\" (to play a ball sport, particularly basketball or soccer). It can also be interpreted literally in the sense that the special encases the user in a ball (or \"balls\" them).",
    "In the former sense of a player of e.g. basketball, it has also extended meaning to be used generally to refer to those who are particularly cool or live extravagantly."
