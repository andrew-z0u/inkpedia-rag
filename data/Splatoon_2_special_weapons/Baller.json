    "The Baller is a special weapon in Splatoon 2. It puts the user into a movable player-sized ball that protects them and can explode on command.",
    "The Baller is a transparent sphere that is just large enough to encase an Inkling or Octoling, reminiscent of a hamster[1] or water ball. There are two white strips of tape encircling the Baller that are ripped off when it takes enough damage. A small reservoir of the user's ink rests in the bottom of the Baller.",
    "When using the special, an Inkling or Octoling enters the Baller. This allows them to move quickly and blocks incoming damage taken while inking the ground as they move, and also allows them to roll up walls. If  is held while in the bubble, or after a set time, the Baller explodes, covering the surrounding area in ink. The Baller being inked results in it shrinking, eventually disappearing, instead of the player using it taking damage. The Baller works similar to Splash Wall in matters of destructive bombs. They explode immediately upon touching it, which can be disastrous for teammates nearby.",
    "It appears in three Octo Expansion Stations:",
    "Equipping Special Power Up with Baller increases its durability and explosion radius. The following table shows the HP increase percentage for Baller when stacking the ability.",
    "The ball will eventually explode, allowing you to use the moment you emerge from it as an attack.",
    "You can also hold  to build up power and cause the ball to explode yourself.",
    "For competitive tips about the Baller",
    "\"Baller\" is a noun form of the verbal sense of \"ball\" (to play a ball sport, particularly basketball or soccer). It can also be interpreted literally in the sense that the special encases the user in a ball (or \"balls\" them).",
    "In the former sense of a player of e.g. basketball, it has also extended meaning to be used generally to refer to those who are particularly cool or live extravagantly.",
