    "The Splat BombÂ is a sub weapon in the Splatoon series. It is a thrown bomb that explodes a few seconds after landing.",
    "In Splatoon, the Splat Bomb is a bomb that features green supports connected to yellow and red caps that form the shape of a pyramid. Inside the pyramid is a bag that is filled with the user's ink. The bag seems to have loops on it that wrap around the supports, holding the bag in place. The Splat Bombs used by Agent 3 in Octo Valley are black and combine the supports and caps into one large piece. There are lights on the vertices that change color depending on the upgrades. In Splatoon 2, the overall design is largely unchanged. However, the supports are now purple with green and pink caps. The Splat Bombs used by Agent 4 in Octo Canyon are almost identical to the ones used in Octo Valley, but the lights are blue due to the Octo Canyon Splat Bombs not being upgradable. The Splat Bombs that Callie and DJ Octavio use in the final boss fight have black supports and gold and magenta caps. There is a gold and black squid-shaped sticker on the bag.",
    "When thrown, a second after touching a surface, the Splat Bomb explodes and coats the area in its respective team's color. Splat Bombs do not explode in mid-air unless they roll off of a surface; they can only explode after touching an object. They look slightly different in Octo Valley.",
    "Splat Bombs are the default sub weapon in Octo Valley, able to be switched out for Burst Bombs or Seekers via  once they are unlocked. Neither can be used in amiibo challenges, making Splat Bombs the only usable sub weapon for the Hero Roller and Hero Charger.",
    "Splat Bombs are used to defeat the Octomaw by throwing them into its mouth, stunning it when they explode.",
    "Octobombers and Octolings are also capable of using Splat Bombs, periodically launching them at Agent 3.",
    "- The Splat Bomb's deployment timer begins counting down when it initially touches an object. This countdown is paused when it is falling and resumes when it lands. When throwing a Splat Bomb down at an opponent, it is recommended to first bounce the Splat Bomb off a ledge to begin the countdown timer, thereby giving the opponent less time to react when the Bomb touches the ground.",
    "- Splat Bombs can force enemy players to come out of hiding from behind walls or on top of ledges.",
    "At a range of 0.75 or closer, this weapon will do 180 damage. Below 1.5 range, it deals significantly lower damage of 30. Any distance beyond that will not hurt the enemy.",
    "As Splat Bombs can be used to herd an opponent into a vulnerable position, it is important to be able to continue firing after using the bomb and fully capitalize on the battlefield control provided by the Splat Bomb. The 70% ink consumed by the Splat Bomb makes it desirable to use the ink management abilities Ink Saver (Main) and Ink Saver (Sub). The charts below show the combinations needed to achieve particular shot counts after using a Splat Bomb. Alternatively, a combination of Ink Recovery Up and Ink Saver (Sub) is useful if the player just wants to throw more bombs, as opposed to throwing a bomb and then using the main weapon. After deploying a Splat Bomb, there is a one-second delay before ink can be refilled again. With three mains and two subs of Ink Saver (Sub), two Splat Bombs may be deployed with one full ink tank.",

    "When attacking, they throw a Splat Bomb into the air, and after one second, it explodes, dealing damage. This also coats opponents in ink. The player cannot throw a Splat Bomb when the ink in the tank is below the red line (similarly to Splatoon) or when they are out of ink. When it touches opponents directly, it explodes immediately after touching the opponent. When holding , the Splat Bomb is thrown farther and is thrown directly in the direction instead of in the air.",
    "- Splat Bombs are the most common sub weapon, as they are included in 17 weapon sets in Splatoon and 15 weapon sets in Splatoon 2. However, in Splatoon 3, Splat bombs are tied with Splash Wall, Point Sensor, and Suction Bomb for having the most amount of weapon sets, at 11 weapon sets.",
