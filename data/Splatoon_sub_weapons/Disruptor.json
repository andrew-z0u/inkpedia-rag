The vial itself has a long, thin neck, a round bottom, and a black cork. The Nouveau logo is etched on the glass. There is a metal handle with a black grip connected to the vial by some dark blue supports. When the Disruptor bursts, a shifting spherical cloud of dots appears where the Disruptor was thrown. The cloud is a darker shade of the user's ink and there is a black aura around it. When a player is tagged by a Disruptor, some black squids begin to swirl around them, leaving small purple trails.\n\nWhen thrown, Disruptors will explode on contact in a spherical pattern that can phase through thin walls and around corners.
