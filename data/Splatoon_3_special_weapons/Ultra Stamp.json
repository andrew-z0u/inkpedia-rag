    "The Ultra Stamp is a special weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3. It equips the user with an oversized stamp hammer that can attack repeatedly at close-range or be thrown once at distant enemies.",
    "The Ultra Stamp appears to be an oversized squeaky toy hammer with an ink tank formed from a white-capped plastic jug. Its handle is neon yellow, with the rim between the tank and mallet face on blue. The mallet face and ink tank change color with the user's ink. Debossed on the front of the mallet face is a pattern cropped from the outline of the SquidForce logo - specifically the variant with eyes which is used as the Regular Battle logo. This portion of the weapon acts as the face of the 'stamp', leaving an ink pattern on the floor when used. A white, glossy band around the handle has the Nouveau logo, while the ink tank has the Octopus Oil logo and the Nouveau logo debossed.",
    "A single swing of the Ultra Stamp with  leaves behind a pattern of ink identical to the logo on its front, as it is the pattern 'stamped' onto the ground. Continuous swings of the stamp by holding  causes the stamped patterns left behind to somewhat blend together, though still leaving gaps in the pattern. When thrown with , a medium-sized circle of ink is left with a very fine splatter on the edges, and when swung in the air, a short line of ink is left on the ground beneath it. The line of ink left on the ground changes length based on when in the jump the swing is performed, and the direction the player is looking.",

    "The Ultra Stamp was announced on 29 October 2018. It was released on 7 November 2018 as part of Version 4.2.0.",
    "When activated, the player holds a gigantic plastic mallet in front of them, which continuously stamps ink on the floor while running and provides almost total cover from the front while leaving the back exposed. Take note that in the few frames that the stamp is swinging in the air, the player is still vulnerable from the front and can be splatted. Pressing  swings the mallet and strikes it on the floor, and holding it down lets the player move forward quickly while splatting enemies in the way. Turning is fairly slow in this state. In the air, players can press the attack button to swing the mallet once at high speed, which is a smaller yet fairly efficient attack for splatting opponents directly, while pressing  throws the mallet and ends the special prematurely. Players cannot ride a Ride rail while using an Ultra Stamp. If a player equips one while riding one, they fall off the rail.",

This exploit caused numerous problems in matches, including excessive base invasion. Starfish Mainstage was temporarily removed from the stage rotation while the bug underwent fixing.",
    "- There is another exploit in which Ultra Stamps can be thrown through certain walls. This glitch requires a wall directly in front of the player and one to the right, forming a corner. By continuously walking into the corner and pointing the camera at the correct angle, the Ultra Stamp can be thrown through the wall. This still works as of Version 5.5.0.",
    "- If an Ultra Stamp is thrown at an open Undercover Brella, the canopy will break and the stamp will explode. Sometimes, the stamp will go through the brella and splat the user. However, in some cases they will be protected from all damage.",
