Each beacon summons a temporary tornado of ink and then gets destroyed.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Splatoon 3\n\n2.1 Special Power Up\n2.2 Version history\n2.3 Quotes\n2.4 Sets\n2.5 Badges\n2.6 Gallery\n\n- 2.1 Special Power Up\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Sets\n\n- 2.5 Badges\n\n- 2.6 Gallery\n\n- 3 Strategy\n\n- 4 Trivia\n\n- 5 Names in other languages\n\n- 6 See also\n\n- 7 References\n\n- 2.1 Special Power Up\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Sets\n\n- 2.5 Badges\n\n- 2.6 Gallery\n\nOverall, the Triple Inkstrike features bright green and orange colors, similar to the original Inkstrike and Splat weapons from Splatoon.\n\nThe Triple Inkstrike consists of three parts: a missile launcher, three throwable beacons, and three missiles. The launcher resembles a multifunctional pencil case[1] with three \"pencil holders\" where the three missiles are launched from and a drawer at the bottom for two extra throwable beacons. The throwable beacons are based on pencil sharpeners, with a single hole where a pencil would be inserted along the equator and a clear red dome on the top half where the sharpener blade is visible and pencil shavings would be held. When the beacon lands, the bottom half transforms into a stand and the beacon emits a signal laser from its top towards the sky. The missiles resemble pencils, with the long hexagonal main body with some Inkling text written on the side, a clear red protector with googly eyes covering the tip that resembles the nosecone of the original Inkstrike, and the missile propellers covering the eraser end that deploy upon launch.\n\nOnce activated, the user launches three missiles into the air immediately. Then, the user has 6 seconds to throw up to three beacons using , each of which marks where each missile will land with a landing marker. The markers function similarly to Suction Bombs, sticking to walls and the ground upon impact. Each missile strikes where a beacon lands, creating a giant ink tornado that inks the ground and splats opponents caught in it similarly to the original Inkstrike, although much smaller and with a shorter duration.\n\nThe tornadoes take about 1.33 seconds to activate once the guide sticks to an object. Once the tornado activates, it expands out over the course of 50 frames, dealing 37.5 damage every 5 frames, or at most 412.5 damage to a single target (as the damage immediately starts when they enter the damage radius). The damage radius expands to 7.7 units at most, which is slightly less than the 30 damage radius of a Suction Bomb[2].\n\nThe player cannot use their main or sub weapons or transform into swim form while using this special.\n\nThis special is one of the nine available specials in Salmon Run Next Wave.\n\nIt appears in four Return of the Mammalians missions:\n\n- 0000 After Alterna\n\n- 0509 Low Viz, High Risk\n\n- 0602 Octarian Heights\n\n- Rocket 02 Alterna Space Center Hangar\n\nEquipping Special Power Up with Triple Inkstrike increases the range of the thrown markers.\n\n- ▲ The guide devices will now trigger when touched by a Salmonid.\n\n- ▲ Damage dealt increased by about 25%: 40.0 → 50.0\n\n- ▲ Increased the radius of the area damaged by about 10%: 7 units → 7.7 units.\n\n- ▲ Increased damage inflicted by about 50%: 25.0 → 37.5.\n\n- ▲ Damage dealt to Crab Tank armor increased by approximately 50%: 2x → 3x.\n\nBoom! We didn't want you to wait too long. Observe how a user can group ink strikes closely... or space them out strategically. Truly, this is a weapon that rewards the flexible and calculating user. Apologies for our earlier \"boom\" - we do get excited here at the Squid Research Lab.\n\nWining a certain number of battles with the Triple Inkstrike will reward the player with special badges that they can use on their Splashtag.\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- The marker that appears where a beacon lands.\n\n- The tornado that appears when a missile hits the ground.\n\n- An Inkling using the Triple Inkstrike.\n\n- A view of the Triple Inkstrike's tornado from below, as seen by throwing a beacon onto one of the lobby's metal railings.\n\n- Icon in the special gauge\n\n- An earlier version of the Triple Inkstrike icon.
