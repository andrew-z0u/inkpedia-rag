  "content": "The Zipcaster is a special weapon in Splatoon 3. It temporarily allows the user to stretch their arm to quickly grapple to walls, causing damaging explosions on impact. While the player is grappling, they are given a small amount of armor temporarily.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Splatoon 3\n\n2.1 Special Power Up\n2.2 Version history\n2.3 Quotes\n2.4 Sets\n2.5 Badges\n2.6 Gallery\n\n- 2.1 Special Power Up\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Sets\n\n- 2.5 Badges\n\n- 2.6 Gallery\n\n- 3 Strategy\n\n- 4 Trivia\n\n- 5 Names in other languages\n\n5.1 Translation notes\n\n- 5.1 Translation notes\n\n- 6 References\n\n- 2.1 Special Power Up\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Sets\n\n- 2.5 Badges\n\n- 2.6 Gallery\n\n- 5.1 Translation notes\n\nActivating the Zipcaster coats the user in team-colored ink. It also gives the user a \"helmet\" resembling their squid or octopus form and a \"scarf\" resembling their tentacle, both of which depend on the user's species. The user can also stretch their arms while in this form.\n\n- Inkling\n\n- Octoling\n\nWhile active, the user can stretch their right arm with  to grab a wall, ceiling, or floor up to 35 units away. Upon grabbing a location, the user will quickly fly towards that spot, dealing 60 damage on contact with opponents and creating a small explosion of ink that deals between 35 and 45 damage upon landing[1]. Grates cannot be grabbed, and the user will fly right through them if they grab something on the other side. The user can still use their main weapon while they are not using the hook, though sub weapons cannot be used as they are replaced by the Zipcaster's hook.\n\nThe speed of the grapple's flight starts out slow with a short acceleration period, after which the user will move at 0.54 units per frame. Once the user has moved at least 6 units, they begin to accelerate again until they have traveled for 15 units, at which point their speed will be 1.08 units per frame[1]. When landing a grapple before reaching full speed, the damage and radius of the landing explosion are reduced by up to 28.6%, while the contact damage stays unaffected. This can prevent the player from getting a splat with one hook that combines both damages if their targeted spot is too close to where they start the hook.\n\nThe player's ink tank, which is 50% larger than usual but cannot recover ink, functions as the special's duration, with the special gauge also showing the amount of ink the player has left. Once the player runs out of ink, they will jump back to where the special was activated, ending the special. This return spot is visible to all players.\n\nWhile grappling, the player is given armor that breaks after taking at least 30 damage but can negate up to 100 damage from a single hit. Any extra damage above 100 is dealt to the player, with this extra damage being capped at 80. This effect is identical to Ink Armor. The armor refreshes every time the user grapples a surface.\n\nIf the player hits a wall, they will stick to it even if it cannot be inked. While stuck to a wall, the player can throw out another tentacle without letting go, or jump off the wall to gain extra height. Going into swim form or using a main weapon will unstick the player. The Zipcaster cannot stick to ceilings or floors.\n\nIt appears in six Return of the Mammalians missions:\n\n- 0000 After Alterna\n\n- 0106 Zip, Splat, and Jump\n\n- 0405 Amusing a Bemused Muse\n\n- 0506 Zipping over the Neighborhood\n\n- 0511 Simply Zipcastic!\n\n- Rocket 05 The Spirit Lifter: First Class\n\nEquipping Special Power Up with Zipcaster decreases the rate in which the ink tank drains passively from 10% per second to as low as 8% per second, and decreases the ink consumption for using the hook from 4% to as low as 1.5%. Since the special ends when the player runs out of ink, this effectively increases the duration of the special.[1]\n\n- — Fixed an issue with moving long distances where certain inputs could allow the player to use their main weapon even while moving.\n\n- ▲ Ink consumption when using a main weapon while the Zipcaster is active has been decreased to about 67% of previous.\nInk tank capacity: 100% → 150%.\nInk consumed per second: 10% → 15%.\nHook ink consumption: 4% → 6%.\n\n- Ink tank capacity: 100% → 150%.\n\n- Ink consumed per second: 10% → 15%.\n\n- Hook ink consumption: 4% → 6%.\n\n- — Fixed an issue where a player who activated the Zipcaster while holding  and then immediately releasing  would result in a sub weapon being used despite the Zipcaster being in use, making the time of the Zipcaster's continuous use shorter.\n\n- Ink tank capacity: 100% → 150%.\n\n- Ink consumed per second: 10% → 15%.\n\n- Hook ink consumption: 4% → 6%.\n\n- — Fixed an issue where after having used the Inkjet or Zipcaster without once touching the ground, the player lands in an unintended location.\n\n- — Fixed an issue where players who Super Jumped to a player who was using a Zipcaster would sometimes land in an unintended location.\n\n- ▲ Now possible to attach closer to the ground than before: 4 units → 3 units\n\n- ▲ Increased the damage dealt by the explosion from colliding with the ground. The radius of that explosion has increased by approximately 50%.\nMaximum damage: 35.0 → 45.0.\nMaximum damage radius: 3.2 units → 4.8 units.\nMinimum damage: 25.0 → 35.0.\nMinimum damage radius: 4 units → 6 units.\n\n- Maximum damage: 35.0 → 45.0.\n\n- Maximum damage radius: 3.2 units → 4.8 units.\n\n- Minimum damage: 25.0 → 35.0.\n\n- Minimum damage radius: 4 units → 6 units.\n\n- Maximum damage: 35.0 → 45.0.\n\n- Maximum damage radius: 3.2 units → 4.8 units.\n\n- Minimum damage: 25.0 → 35.0.\n\n- Minimum damage radius: 4 units → 6 units.\n\n- — Fixed an issue where a player's jump height was lower than normal when they extended a Zipcaster arm to attach to a wall while their feet were in enemy ink and then jumped immediately afterward.\n\n- — Fixed an issue in Mahi-Mahi Resort that caused players to clip into terrain by using the Zipcaster from certain locations when the water level changed.\n\n- — Fixed an issue in Crableg Capital that made it so that the Zipcaster could only be used to cling to the steel beams around the outer edge of the stage on one team's side.\n\n- — Fixed an issue in Shipshape Cargo Co. where the Zipcaster could be used to get inside terrain from beneath certain obstacles.\n\n- ▲ Increased the radius of the area of the explosion at the landing point that deals 45.0 damage by approximately 9%: 4.8 units → 5.25 units.\nNo changes to the radius of the area that deals 35.0 damage.\n\n- No changes to the radius of the area that deals 35.0 damage.\n\n- No changes to the radius of the area that deals 35.0 damage.\n\nWining a certain number of battles with the Zipcaster will reward the player with special badges that they can use on their Splashtag.\n\n- An Inkling using the Zipcaster\n\n- Zipcaster in use, with landing icon visible\n\n- Icon in the special gauge (when used with the Octobrush)\n\n- An earlier version of the Zipcaster icon.\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Zipcaster.\n\n- Uncropped version of the Tableturf card icon.\n\n- The Zipcaster Recall Point.\n\nFor competitive tips about the Zipcaster\n\n- When the special has almost run out, grappling again, then the special running out will cause the player to go to the grapple destination, but on the way and while super jumping back to the activation spot, the player's ink tank will run out, and 'low ink' will flash next to the player. However, once the player returns to the activation spot, they will have full ink.\n\n- When jumping down from the spawn drone a player can jump to an ineligible surface for the recall point. If they activate the Zipcaster, the first eligible surface they stand on will have the recall point placed there. This allows the player to reach spots only possible with the Zipcaster while it not being active.\n\n- As the special runs out the ink that covers the player will slowly fade away.\n\n- If the player falls out-of-bounds while the Zipcaster special is activated, they will simply Super Jump back to their recall point—or the player's last eligible surface if activated out-of-bounds—similar to the Inkjet.\n\n- A character under the effect of the Zipcaster bears a strong resemblance to Greninja, likely as a nod to it."
