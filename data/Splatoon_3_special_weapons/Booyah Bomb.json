    "The Booyah Bomb is a special weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3. It coats the user in strong armor, allowing them and their teammates to charge a ball of ink that the user can throw to attack a large area.",
    "When activated, the Booyah Bomb coats the user in a skin of their ink and raises them into the air. The user is given a small, swirling circle of ink with a glowing dot in the center that increases in size with every \"Booyah!\" signal that the user's team sends out. When it is fully charged, the user can throw the Booyah Bomb (leaving a splotch of ink under their feet), which creates a small ink sphere on its landing point. The sphere then rapidly grows and dissipates, laying down ink in a ring-filled pattern. In Splatoon 3, there is a small visual effect of ink and colored lightning where the Booyah Bomb lands before exploding.",

    "- The ink left on the ground by the Booyah Bomb's explosion and it being thrown (Splatoon 3)",
    "When activated, the user temporarily rises upward and levitates above the ground, holding up a glowing ball of ink that charges up over time. Once charged, this can be thrown to make an ink explosion which is made larger as it charges up. The user and their teammates can use the \"Booyah!\" signal to charge up the attack faster. Teammates using this signal also slightly fill up their own special gauge. The charge takes approximately 8.5 seconds to reach its maximum power without signaling. With only the user signaling, it can be reduced to about three seconds, and less if multiple players are contributing. Equipping Special Power Up also reduces the charge time of the Booyah Bomb.",
    "Once the user rises to the necessary height to perform the special, the user is protected by a limited-durability shield similar to Ink Armor which negates damage until it either breaks or when the special ends.",
    "Equipping Special Power Up with Booyah Bomb decreases how much charge is needed to fully charge the bomb, and it also decreases throwing time.",
    "- While the special is charging, the user has a protective shield that negates any damage being thrown at the player.\nThe shield has 470 HP and has varying damage multipliers against certain weapons.\nThe shield disappears when the special is finished or is broken by enemy damage. When the shield is destroyed, the user will be completely vulnerable to incoming attacks.",
    "- The Booyah Bomb does not do damage upon landing on a surface.\nThe bomb takes about forty frames after landing before it expands and begins to do damage.",
    "- Every time the user uses \"Booyah!\" command, the special charges by +0.07 Booyah Bomb charge points.",
    "- The special can register a total of five \"Booyah!\" commands from allies.\nBooyah Bomb charge increase for allies who \"Booyah!\":\nFirst \"Booyah!\": +0.08 Booyah Bomb charge.\nSecond \"Booyah!\": +0.04 Booyah Bomb charge.\nThird \"Booyah!\": +0.02 Booyah Bomb charge.\nFourth \"Booyah!\": +0.01 Booyah Bomb charge.\nFifth \"Booyah!\": +0.01 Booyah Bomb charge.\nSpecial gauge increase for allies who \"Booyah!\":\nFirst \"Booyah!\": +6p towards special gauge.\nSecond \"Booyah!\": +3p towards special gauge.\nThird \"Booyah!\": +2p towards special gauge.\nFourth \"Booyah!\": +1p towards special gauge.\nFifth \"Booyah!\": +0.5p towards special gauge.",

    "For competitive tips about the Booyah Bomb",
    "- The design and function of this weapon appear to be inspired by the Spirit Bomb from the manga and anime series Dragon Ball, created by Akira Toriyama. This is especially reflected in its ability to become stronger the more people cheer on the user. Its American and Japanese names also mirror the change from 'ball' to 'bomb' for the technique.",
    "- The way that the Booyah Bomb deals damage, as well as the large circle of ink that the Booyah Bomb creates when it hits inkable turf, are both very similar to the Inkstrike.",
    "- The Booyah Bomb was not the first special weapon to be added post-release; that title belongs to the Bubble Blower. However, unlike the Bubble Blower, the Booyah Bomb was not confirmed in the initial release by an in-game description.",
    "- Before version 4.3.0 of Splatoon 2, there were glitches involving the Booyah Bomb and Quick Super Jump, allowing the player to glitch out of bounds if they jump from one side of the map to the other.[2]",
    "- The Booyah Bomb was shown in the version 4.0.0 trailer, but neither the Kensa Splattershot Pro nor the Kensa Dynamo Roller was made available until version 4.1.0.",
    "- When the player is charging up the Booyah Bomb in Salmon Run Next Wave, they can be pushed around by a moving Fish Stick.[3][4]",
    "- When the shield is taking damage, the shield sound effect from the first game can be heard, and when it is destroyed, the armor breaking sound effect can be heard."
