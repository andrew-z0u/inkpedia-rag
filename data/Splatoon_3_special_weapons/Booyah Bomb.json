    "The Booyah Bomb is a special weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3. It coats the user in strong armor, allowing them and their teammates to charge a ball of ink that the user can throw to attack a large area.",
    "When activated, the Booyah Bomb coats the user in a skin of their ink and raises them into the air. The user is given a small, swirling circle of ink with a glowing dot in the center that increases in size with every \"Booyah!\" signal that the user's team sends out. When it is fully charged, the user can throw the Booyah Bomb (leaving a splotch of ink under their feet), which creates a small ink sphere on its landing point. The sphere then rapidly grows and dissipates, laying down ink in a ring-filled pattern. In Splatoon 3, there is a small visual effect of ink and colored lightning where the Booyah Bomb lands before exploding.",
    "When activated, the user temporarily rises upward and levitates above the ground, holding up a glowing ball of ink that charges up over time. Once charged, this can be thrown to make an ink explosion which is made larger as it charges up. The user and their teammates can use the \"Booyah!\" signal to charge up the attack faster. Teammates using this signal also slightly fill up their own special gauge. The charge takes approximately 8.5 seconds to reach its maximum power without signaling. With only the user signaling, it can be reduced to about three seconds, and less if multiple players are contributing. Equipping Special Power Up also reduces the charge time of the Booyah Bomb.",
    "Once the user rises to the necessary height to perform the special, the user is protected by a limited-durability shield similar to Ink Armor which negates damage until it either breaks or when the special ends.",
    "Equipping Special Power Up with Booyah Bomb decreases how much charge is needed to fully charge the bomb, and it also decreases throwing time.",
    "[1]",
    "By sending and receiving \"Booyah\"s from your team, you can build power more quickly.\nTeammates who send Booyahs will be rewarded by having their special gauge filled a little.",
    "The Booyah Bomb makes a return in Splatoon 3 and is available as a special weapon in Salmon Run Next Wave. It keeps its attributes from Splatoon 2.",
    "Equipping Special Power Up with Booyah Bomb decreases how much charge is needed to fully charge a Booyah Bomb, and it also decreases throwing time.",
    "Wining a certain number of battles with the Booyah Bomb will reward the player with special badges that they can use on their Splashtag.",
