It is a vacuum that sucks up enemy ink attacks and then fires out an exploding projectile, with the size of the explosion depending on the amount of ink sucked in.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Splatoon 3\n\n2.1 Special Power Up\n2.2 Version history\n2.3 Quotes\n2.4 Sets\n2.5 Badges\n2.6 Gallery\n\n- 2.1 Special Power Up\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Sets\n\n- 2.5 Badges\n\n- 2.6 Gallery\n\n- 3 Strategy\n\n- 4 Trivia\n\n- 5 Names in other languages\n\n- 6 References\n\n- 2.1 Special Power Up\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Sets\n\n- 2.5 Badges\n\n- 2.6 Gallery\n\nThe Ink Vac is based on a diesel-powered backpack vacuum cleaner or leaf blower. The backpack consists of a white ink canister and a cyan vacuum engine below it. As the Ink Vac absorbs more enemy ink, the canister gets filled by glowing ink of the Ink Vac user's color and seems to shake more intensely. The engine has some control panels and a hose connecting it to a massive nozzle. The nozzle is cyan-and-black with two handles. The logo of a weapon brand (coloquially named \"D\") can be seen on the canister and the nozzle.\n\nWhen deployed, the player can hold down  to create a vortex that sucks up enemy ink projectiles (including ink droplets), bombs, and even some special weapons, though it cannot suck up enemy ink that has touched the ground. This vortex also protects the user and their teammates from taking damage from explosions, even though it does not entirely destroy them (the user can also still take damage from explosions from behind). Sucking in opponents' ink fills up the Ink Vac, and slows down the user's movement speed. A maximum of 1200 damage can be absorbed before the Ink Vac fills up fully. Opponents caught within the Ink Vac's vortex will lose ink and be slowed down, similar to Toxic Mist, and also fill the Ink Vac up at a rate of 1.5 damage per frame (90 damage per second), although they do not actually take damage. However, the vortex does damage most objects, such as Sprinklers, Wave Breakers, and brella shields, at a rate of 2 damage per frame (120 damage per second). Although the vortex is stopped by solid walls, it can pass through barriers such as Splash Walls and the Rainmaker shield.\n\n6 seconds after activation, or when the tank is filled, the Ink Vac readies a projectile of ink that can be aimed, launching manually upon releasing  or automatically after approximately 2.5 seconds. This projectile damages anything it comes into contact with, and once it lands, a damage radius is displayed before exploding shortly afterwards, dealing damage to any opponents within radius and line of sight of the blast. The size of the explosion depends on how full the Ink Vac's tank was upon firing.[1][2]\n\nIt appears in two Return of the Mammalians missions:\n\n- 0000 After Alterna\n\n- Rocket 02 Alterna Space Center Hangar\n\nEquipping Special Power Up with Ink Vac increases the radius of its vortex. The size of the larger portion of the vortex gets increased by up to about 30%, while the size of the smaller portion gets increased by up to about 75%.\n\n- ▲ Damage of the return shot has been increased from 120.0 to 220.0.\nThis change is intended to increase the damage done to Big Bubbler and Rainmaker shields and to allow players to defeat opponents armored due to Squid Roll or Squid Surge.\n\n- This change is intended to increase the damage done to Big Bubbler and Rainmaker shields and to allow players to defeat opponents armored due to Squid Roll or Squid Surge.\n\n- This change is intended to increase the damage done to Big Bubbler and Rainmaker shields and to allow players to defeat opponents armored due to Squid Roll or Squid Surge.\n\n- ▲ Increased the radius of the outer perimeter when vacuuming up ink by roughly 10% to cover a larger area than before: 3 units → 3.3 units.\n\n- ▲ Increased the radius of the ink-shot explosion by approximately 50% when the amount of the opponent's ink that was sucked up is at the minimum: 4 units → 6 units.\n\n- ▲ Increased the radius of the ink-shot explosion by approximately 25% when the amount of the opponent's ink that was sucked up is at the maximum: 8 units → 10 units.\n\n- ▲ The ground slightly behind the user will be inked periodically while it is active.\n\n- ▲ Made it so that when the ink shot impacts a wall, the explosion will also ink nearby ground.\n\n- ▲ Made it so that when the ink shot impacts the ground, the explosion will also ink nearby walls.\n\n- ▲ Increased the amount of opponent ink that can be sucked up: 800.0 damage → 1200.0 damage.\n\n- ▲ Increased the radius of the ink-shot explosion when the amount of the opponent ink that was sucked up is at the maximum by approximately 10%: 10 units → 11 units.\n\nThe more attacks it inhales, the more powerful the Ink Vac becomes. This is the sort of weapon that could provide security for an entire squad! Rest assured that our excitement is tempered by academic rigor.\n\nWinning a certain number of battles with the Ink Vac will reward the player with special badges that they can use on their Splashtag.\n\n- Using the Ink Vac.\n\n- Shooting the projectile at the end of the special.\n\n- An Inkling using the Ink Vac\n\n- Icon in the special gauge (Splat Charger or Splatterscope).\n\n- An earlier version of the Ink Vac icon.\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Ink Vac.\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Ink_Vac_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nInk Vac model rotating (link to file)\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Ink_Vac_demonstration.mp4\n\n\nUsing the Ink Vac (link to file)\n\nFor competitive tips about the Ink Vac\n\n- When an Ink Vac's projectile explodes, it creates a mass of liquid spikes reminiscent of how ferrofluid acts in the presence of a magnet."
