The sphere rests in an indentation in the cone and is connected to it via a wire. After being thrown, the sphere will start bouncing up and down, releasing circular shock waves of black squids.\n\nWhen activated, the user will hold the Wave Breaker above their head, which can then be thrown with . It can be held for an unlimited amount of time. Once the device lands, it marks nearby opposing players for less than a second. Right afterwards, the sphere starts bouncing up and down, releasing damaging shock waves over a 20 unit radius that expand from the base of the cone with a wider area of effect than the one when landing. These shock waves follow the ground and go through walls, including barriers such as Big Bubbler.\nOver its duration, the Wave Breaker will unleash a total of three shock waves before breaking. Opponents that come into contact with the shock wave are dealt damage and marked for a longer period of time. Opponents can also be damaged from contact with a Wave Breaker. The shock waves can be avoided by jumping over them, and opponents can only be hurt by each shock wave once. The Wave Breaker can be destroyed by dealing damage to it; it has 480 HP and takes damage with certain multipliers depending on the weapon used. It can also be crushed by moving platforms such as the tower in Tower Control or the rotating platforms on Museum d'Alfonsino.\n\nThis special is one of the nine available specials in Salmon Run Next Wave.\n\nIt appears in 2 Return of the Mammalians missions:\n\n- 0000 After Alterna\n\n- Rocket 02 Alterna Space Center Hangar\n\nEquipping Special Power Up with Wave Breaker increases the travel distance of its shock waves without increasing speed.\n\n- — Fixed an issue where its waves would not be visible if placed in a location with a height difference, even in the area of effect.\n\n- — Fixed an issue where it would not activate when placed on terrain at a certain angle, rather than catching and falling.\n\n- — Fixed an issue where placing a Wave Breaker overlapping an opponent's Splash Wall would cause the Wave Breaker to disappear on the opponent's screen.\n\n- — Fixed an issue where it immediately vanishes from other players' screens if the elevation of its placement is close to the waterline.\n\n- — Fixed an issue where if it is placed at a specific elevation, its waves do not display in adjacent lower spaces within the area of effect.\n\n- — Fixed an issue where if it is placed at a specific elevation, adjacent lower spaces may or may not come within the area of effect due to slight differences in position by slightly increasing the area of effect in the lower area.\n\n- — Fixed an issue where there could be a delay in recovering from existing damage if you were within range of an attack from a Wave Breaker or Big Shot and avoided taking damage by jumping or other means.\n\n- — Fixed an issue that sometimes sent a player's Wave Breaker far away when they tried placing it on an edge.\n\n- — Fixed an issue where an enemy's Wave Breaker would sometimes still appear on their own screen even if another player used an Ink Vac to suck up and extinguish it.\n\n- Salmon Run Next Wave:\n— Fixed an issue where the Wave Breaker would sometimes remain without vanishing when a player threw it at a Flyfish's cockpit.\n\n- — Fixed an issue where the Wave Breaker would sometimes remain without vanishing when a player threw it at a Flyfish's cockpit.\n\n- — Fixed an issue where the Wave Breaker would sometimes remain without vanishing when a player threw it at a Flyfish's cockpit.\n\n- ▲ When placed, enemies around it will be marked for a short period of time.\n\n- ▲ Increased durability by approximately 20%: 400.0 → 480.0.\n\n- ▲ Decreased damage taken from ink flung by opponents's splatanas by approximately 50%: 4.8x → 2.4x.\n\nOf course, no special weapon is perfect, and the Wave Breaker can be \"defeated\" by the advanced strategy of… rechecking video… jumping over the waves it sends out? Huh. Still, making an opponent jump from a hidden position could lead to a win. And that makes it win adjacent!\n\nWinning a certain number of battles with the Wave Breaker will reward the player with special badges that they can use on their Splashtag.\n\n- Promotional render\n\n- Wave Breaker releasing a shock wave\n\n- An earlier version of the Wave Breaker icon.\n\n- 2D icon.\n\n- 2D icon used in Side Order\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Wave Breaker.\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Wave_Breaker_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nWave Breaker model rotating (link to file)\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Wave_Breaker_demonstration.mp4\n\n\nUsing the Wave Breaker (link to file)\n\nFor competitive tips about the Wave Breaker\n\n- The Wave Breaker bears a loose resemblance to Splatoon's Echolocator special weapon, being able to mark a large number of opponents at once."
