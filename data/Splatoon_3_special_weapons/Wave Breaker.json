    "The Wave Breaker is a special weapon in Splatoon 3. It is a device that releases up to three expanding shock waves that damage and track opponents that touch them.",
    "The Wave Breaker consists of a conical device resembling a pop-and-catch toy. The sphere rests in an indentation in the cone and is connected to it via a wire. After being thrown, the sphere will start bouncing up and down, releasing circular shock waves of black squids.",
    "When activated, the user will hold the Wave Breaker above their head, which can then be thrown with . It can be held for an unlimited amount of time. Once the device lands, it marks nearby opposing players for less than a second. Right afterwards, the sphere starts bouncing up and down, releasing damaging shock waves that expand from the base of the cone with a wider area of effect than the one when landing. These shock waves follow the ground and go through walls, including barriers such as Big Bubbler.\nOver its duration, the Wave Breaker will unleash a total of three shock waves before breaking. Opponents that come into contact with the shock wave are dealt damage and marked for a longer period of time. Opponents can also be damaged from contact with a Wave Breaker. The shock waves can be avoided by jumping over them, and opponents can only be hurt by each shock wave once. The Wave Breaker can be destroyed by dealing damage to it; it has 480 HP and takes damage with certain multipliers depending on the weapon used. It can also be crushed by moving platforms such as the tower in Tower Control or the rotating platforms on Museum d'Alfonsino.",
