Its outer shell changes color to match the user's ink. It is armed with three turret-like cannons, one on each front limb, and one in the center of its body.\n\nThe Crab Tank can walk and strafe like players, or curl up into a ball to move faster and climb up walls, inking the surface as it moves, similar to the Baller. Like a real crab, the tank walks faster side-to-side than it does forwards or backwards. When climbing, the crab tank cannot move left and right, only up and down.\n\nThe Crab Tank has 500 HP and has varying damage multipliers against certain weapons:\n\nIn walking mode, the tank has two firing modes: pressing  fires a ball of ink in an arc that pierces enemies and explodes on contact similar to the Explosher, while  fires a rapid stream of bullets from two turrets, similar to dualies. Continuously shooting with  increases the Crab Tank's firing rate drastically; it starts with a fire rate similar to the .96 Gal, but the peak rate of fire is the same as the Hydra Splatling. Interrupting the continuous fire by rolling, using the cannon with , or letting go of  will reset the fire rate to its starting point. The user sits on the back of the tank, where they can be damaged from above, behind, or the side.\n\nIn ball mode, the Crab Tank can move in all directions freely and climb walls, leaving a path of ink behind itself and dealing modest contact damage to enemies. It can also do a small \"crab hop\" by pressing . The player is completely protected in ball mode, and can heal at an accelerated rate similar to swim form. Although the Crab Tank turns and adjusts its aim very slowly while in walking mode, it faces in the direction of the camera when coming out of ball mode. Switching to ball mode and back to walking mode can allow it to turn more quickly, although the special cannot fire for a brief period after exiting ball mode (except in Salmon Run Next Wave).\n\nThe Crab Tank flashes red when its duration is almost up, warning the user the special will run out soon. Once the special ends, the crab tank will disappear and the player can move after a short delay. If the tank itself is destroyed, the player is ejected rather than splatted, and the special ends.\n\nThis special is one of the nine available specials in Salmon Run Next Wave.\n\nIt appears in 4 Return of the Mammalians missions:\n\n- 0000 After Alterna\n\n- 0205 Tread Heavily\n\n- Rocket 02 Alterna Space Center Hangar\n\n- Rocket 04 The Spirit Lifter: Steerage\n\nEquipping Special Power Up with Crab Tank increases its duration. The following table shows the duration, in number of frames, when stacking Special Power Up.[1]\n\n- ▼ Shortened the duration of the Crab Tank when not using the Special Power Up gear ability from about 9 seconds to about 8 seconds.\n\n- ▲ Increased the extension rate of the duration of the Crab Tank when using the Special Power Up gear ability.\nAs a result of these changes, the duration of the Crab Tank when maximizing use of the Special Power Up gear ability remains the same as before.\n\n- As a result of these changes, the duration of the Crab Tank when maximizing use of the Special Power Up gear ability remains the same as before.\n\n- — Fixed an issue where attacks to the rear, like Ink Storm, bounce off when the tank is in walking mode even when directly striking the player.\n\n- As a result of these changes, the duration of the Crab Tank when maximizing use of the Special Power Up gear ability remains the same as before.\n\n- — The sound effect when activating is now less audible to teammates.\n\n- ▼ Introduced an interval where players cannot attack for roughly 0.33 seconds (20 frames) after returning to attack mode from mobile mode.\n\n- ▼ Increased the amount of time it takes for players to act again after the special ends: 0 frames → 25 frames.\n\n- — Fixed an issue that allowed Crab Tank users who held down the  Button before changing from mobile mode to attack mode to start rapid firing slightly faster than usual.\n\n- — Fixed issues that could occur when the Crab Tank effect ends, such as the player being at a slightly raised position and able to climb terrain at an unintended height or being unable to smoothly use Squid Surge immediately after the end of the effect.\n\n- — Fixed an issue where damage done to targets by the explosion from a Crab Tank's cannon would count as double in the lobby for a special Splatfest.\n\n- — Fixed an issue where, if a player was using the Crab Tank and changed to mobile mode at a specific moment just before a wave ended, the Crab Tank would be treated as though it was still in mobile mode even when the next wave started, leaving an ink trail behind it and causing damage by running over opponents.\n\n- — Fixed an issue that caused shots from the Crab Tank's cannon to do less damage than before when hitting the body of a Steelhead while it's growing a bomb from its head.\n\n- ▼ Reduced damage dealt by a direct cannon shot from 60.0 to 50.0.\nWith this change, the damage dealt simultaneously by a direct cannon shot and the explosion is reduced from 90.0 to 80.0.\n\n- With this change, the damage dealt simultaneously by a direct cannon shot and the explosion is reduced from 90.0 to 80.0.\n\n- With this change, the damage dealt simultaneously by a direct cannon shot and the explosion is reduced from 90.0 to 80.0.\n\nWining a certain number of battles with the Crab Tank will reward the player with special badges that they can use on their Splashtag.\n\n- Early promotional screenshot of the Crab Tank\n\n- An Inkling riding the early design of the Crab Tank\n\n- The Crab Tank curling up into a ball and climbing a wall\n\n- A Crab Tank shooting ink from its cannon\n\n- A Crab Tank firing ink\n\n- The Crab Tank icon in the special gauge\n\n- Using the Crab Tank in Salmon Run Next Wave\n\n- An earlier version of the Crab Tank icon.\n\n- 2D icon.\n\n- 2D icon used in Side Order\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Crab Tank.\n\n- Uncropped version of the Tableturf card icon.\n\n- Crab Tank concept art from The Art of Splatoon 3\n\nFor competitive tips about the Crab Tank\n\n- Prior to the Salmon Run Next Wave trailer, the Crab Tank is primarily yellow with sections that change color to match the user's ink instead of the whole tank matching the user's ink.\n\n- The outside cannons resemble a style of junctioned exhaust headers mainly used in speedboat engines.\n\n- The Crab Tank's multiple legs, ability to turn into a ball, and twin machine guns make it similar to the Wrecking Ball mech from the game Overwatch.\n\n- If a Crab Tank user is tagged (by a Point Sensor for example), and rolls, their position tag will roll with Crab Tank.\n\n- In Salmon Run Next Wave, the  attack acts as a bomb, allowing players to take down Flyfish and Mudmouths easily.\n\n- The Crab Tank was not added to any post-released main weapon until the Splatana Stamper Nouveau in Chill Season 2023, being the last special to be put on a new set post-release.\n\n- Baller\n\n- Inkjet"
