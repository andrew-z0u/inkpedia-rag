The jetpack has what appears to be a plastic water or soda bottle filled with the user's ink connected to a large gray tube and a metal device. Said device has two more tubes, one on the left side and one on the right, that face downwards and excrete ink that allows the user to hover in the air. A gray harness wraps around the user's body. The cannon changes color to match the user's ink with a dark gray nozzle. The trigger is positioned below the main body inside of a handle that the user puts their arm around. The icon that appears on the Inkjet's recall point is a small depiction of the Inkjet's jetpack. The lines are white and the whole icon is shaded with a darker shade of the user's ink color.\n\nWhen activated, the player can fly about in the air and shoot blaster-like projectiles. The jet also leaves a trail of ink which comes out of the jet's exhaust and can splat enemy players. While the player is in mid-air, they can switch to squid or octopus form. Players can also press  while hovering to gain a temporary boost in height. When the special's duration ends, the player Super Jumps back to the location where they activated the Inkjet. The Inkjet's landing marker is visible to all players, much like a Super Jump marker. Unlike other specials, if the player falls off the stage, they will Super Jump back to the location where they activated the Inkjet and the special ends. When using the Inkjet, the player is unable to obtain the Rainmaker or score Power Clams.\n\nWhile continuously firing, the inkjet receives a movement speed reduction based on the main weapon's strafing speed.[1] Even though Inkjet users are technically flying and not running, Run Speed Up reduces the movement speed firing penalty, but it does not subsequently increase movement speed when not firing except when walking on grates.\n\nIt appears in six Octo Expansion Stations:\n\n- A07 Maverick Station\n\n- C10 McFly Station\n\n- D09 Goose Station\n\n- G10 E07 Iceman Station\n\n- J01 H07 Cool Your Jets Station\n\n- Escape 5 Diaphragm Phase\n\nEqupping Special Power Up with Inkjet increases its duration and the explosion radius of its shots.\n\n- ▲ Buffed compared to the Inkjet in the Splatoon 2 Global Testfire. If the player falls off the stage, they return to the Inkjet's starting point.\n\n- ▼ Increased the size of the hit box of the player using the Inkjet, making them easier to shoot down.\n\n- ▼ Decreased damage radius of Inkjet shots hitting the ground by roughly 17% and radius of ink coverage by roughly 20%.\n\n- ▼ Decreased damage dealt to players standing directly beneath the Inkjet's jets by roughly 75%.\n\n- ▲ Increased damage dealt to opposing Ballers by direct hits or shot splash damage by roughly 100%.\n\n- When Special Power Up is active, the projectiles will have a wider hitbox.\n\n- ▲ The hitbox of the player using Inkjet was slightly decreased, making it a bit harder to shoot the player down.\n\n- ▲ Increased bullet velocity by roughly 19%.\n\n- — Adjusted the sound of the Inkjet making it easier to tell from which direction it is coming.\n\n- ▲ Made it so the player can change direction of movement more quickly than before.\n\n- – Increased visibility of the mark indicating where the Inkjet user will return to after its effect ends.\n\n- – Added a gauge to the above mark that indicates when the Inkjet user will return.\n\n- ▼ Reduced active time by roughly 0.5 seconds.\n\n- ▼ Decreased damage dealt to opposing Ballers by roughly 30%.\n\n- ▲ Damage against Splat Brella and Undercover Brella canopies increased by 25%.\n\n- ▲ Damage against Tenta Brella canopy increased by 75%.\n\n- ▲ Increased the speed of shots fired by roughly 5%.\n\nYou can fly temporarily higher by pressing .\n\nPress  to temporarily increase your height.\n\n- Inkjet title card.\n\n- A side view of an Inkling firing the Inkjet.\n\n- An Inkling with the Inkjet.\n\n- Promotional render of Inkjet.\n\n- \"Inkjet activated\" mark spot where the player lands after the special is over.\n\n- Back view of the Inkjet.\n\n- An Octoling (top left) flies the Inkjet\n\nThe Inkjet returns in Splatoon 3 and is available as a special weapon in Salmon Run Next Wave. Its movement speed while firing is now consistent regardless of the main weapon and the amount of Run Speed Up the user has equipped. Because of post-launch updates, the boost after pressing  is now a bit higher, and the explosive shot's 50 damage radius is bigger.\n\nIt appears in two Return of the Mammalians missions:\n\n- 0000 After Alterna\n\n- 0610 Mission: Fly-Fishin'\n\nEquipping Special Power Up with Inkjet increases its duration and the explosion radius of its shots.\n\n- — Reduced the radius at which the blast can deal 50 damage to an opponent by about 16%: 2.5 units → 2.1 units.[2]\nAlthough the blast radius was reduced, the way the game handles hit detection for the inner blast radius was changed, thus the effective blast radius remains about the same.\n\n- Although the blast radius was reduced, the way the game handles hit detection for the inner blast radius was changed, thus the effective blast radius remains about the same.\n\n- — Movement speed while firing is now consistent, regardless of the user's choice of main weapon or equipped Run Speed Up.\n\n- Although the blast radius was reduced, the way the game handles hit detection for the inner blast radius was changed, thus the effective blast radius remains about the same.\n\n- ▲ Player will no longer be a target for most Salmonid attacks when returning to their position after the use period has ended.\n\n- — Fixed an issue where after having used the Inkjet or Zipcaster without once touching the ground, the player lands in an unintended location.\n\n- ▲ Damage dealt to Crab Tank armor increased by about 2.5x.\nDirect hit: 0.8334x → 2.0835x.\nExplosion: 1.4x → 3.5x.\nExhaust: 1x → 2.5x.\n\n- Direct hit: 0.8334x → 2.0835x.\n\n- Explosion: 1.4x → 3.5x.\n\n- Exhaust: 1x → 2.5x.\n\n- — The sound effect when activating is now less audible to teammates.\n\n- Direct hit: 0.8334x → 2.0835x.\n\n- Explosion: 1.4x → 3.5x.\n\n- Exhaust: 1x → 2.5x.\n\n- ▲ Increased the radius of the explosion area that deals 50.0 damage by roughly 43%: 2.1 units → 3.0 units.\nNo changes to the radius of the area that deals 30.0 damage.\n\n- No changes to the radius of the area that deals 30.0 damage.\n\n- ▲ Strengthened the jet of ink that comes out when pressing , enabling players to jump higher than before.\n\n- No changes to the radius of the area that deals 30.0 damage.\n\n- — Fixed an issue that caused a player to not take blast damage from an Inkjet shot if it looked like the shot landed on their screen but not on the screen of the Inkjet user.\n\n- ▼ Decreased the radius of the explosion area that deals 50.0 damage by approximately 15%: 3.0 units → 2.55 units.\nNo changes to the radius of the area that deals 30.0 damage.\n\n- No changes to the radius of the area that deals 30.0 damage.\n\n- No changes to the radius of the area that deals 30.0 damage.\n\n- ▼ Decreased the damage dealt to the Big Bubbler by direct shots and explosions to about 67% of what it was before.\n\n- To the barrier:\nDirect hit: 2.1x → 1.4x.\nExplosion: 2.1x → 1.4x.\n\n- Direct hit: 2.1x → 1.4x.\n\n- Explosion: 2.1x → 1.4x.\n\n- To the weak point:\nDirect hit: 1.575x → 1.05x.\nExplosion: 1.575x → 1.05x.\n\n- Direct hit: 1.575x → 1.05x.\n\n- Explosion: 1.575x → 1.05x.\n\n- Direct hit: 2.1x → 1.4x.\n\n- Explosion: 2.1x → 1.4x.\n\n- Direct hit: 1.575x → 1.05x.\n\n- Explosion: 1.575x → 1.05x.\n\nWining a certain number of battles with the Inkjet will reward the player with special badges that they can use on their Splashtag.\n\n- An Inkling using the Inkjet\n\n- The Inkjet is shown firing a shot at the top left\n\n- An earlier version of the Inkjet icon.\n\n- 2D icon.\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Inkjet.\n\n- Uncropped version of the Tableturf card icon.\n\n- The Inkjet Recall Point\n\nFor competitive tips about the Inkjet\n\n- The Inkjet's name may be a reference to inkjet printers.\n\n- The Inkjet is very similar to the Hover Nozzle used by F.L.U.D.D. in Super Mario Sunshine.\n\n- Marie calls using an Inkjet in Salmon Run to collect far-off golden eggs \"Round-Trip Ticket\".\n\n- At the launch of Splatoon 3, Inkjet was the least common special weapon in the game, only being part of the Tri-Slosher and Ballpoint Splatling's kits."
