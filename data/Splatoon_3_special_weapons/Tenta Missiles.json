They lock onto targets and launch guided missiles that strike from the sky.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Splatoon 2\n\n2.1 Special Power Up\n2.2 Version history\n2.3 Quotes\n2.4 Sets\n2.5 Gallery\n2.6 Demonstration\n\n- 2.1 Special Power Up\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Sets\n\n- 2.5 Gallery\n\n- 2.6 Demonstration\n\n- 3 Splatoon 3\n\n3.1 Special Power Up\n3.2 Version history\n3.3 Sets\n3.4 Badges\n3.5 Gallery\n\n- 3.1 Special Power Up\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Sets\n\n- 3.4 Badges\n\n- 3.5 Gallery\n\n- 4 Strategy\n\n- 5 Trivia\n\n- 6 Names in other languages\n\n- 2.1 Special Power Up\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Sets\n\n- 2.5 Gallery\n\n- 2.6 Demonstration\n\n- 3.1 Special Power Up\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Sets\n\n- 3.4 Badges\n\n- 3.5 Gallery\n\nWhen activated, the Tenta Missiles' user brandishes two large missile launchers. The launchers are mainly yellow, and each consists of one main part on top that harbors four missile compartments and a smaller part on the bottom that only has one compartment. Each missile compartment changes color to match the user's ink. The Tenta Missiles themselves each look like water bottles filled with the user's team's ink. Activating the Tenta Missiles also displays a large circular reticle appears that shows the radius to acquire targets. Some horizontal lines in the user's ink color move up and down along the side of the screen, giving the whole display a more technological feel. When an opposing player is not locked onto or targeted, they appear as two pairs of lines, similar to a shooter's reticle that shows shot deviation. Hovering over a target causes an octagonal icon with an X to appear over them and plays a beep sound effect, which is higher-pitched when more targets are in the reticle. The octagon icon also persists when the missiles are fired on the acquired targets, allowing the user to see the targets for the entire duration of the special. An opposing player targeted by Tenta Missiles will see a ring around them in the Tenta Missile user's ink color with some small bottle icons. The number of bottle icons depends on how many missiles the opposing player is targeted with. The icon that appears to warn opposing players of incoming Tenta Missiles is a simple black circle with a ring of the Tenta Missile user's ink color around it.\n\n- 1 target: 40 frames\n\n- 2 targets: 40 frames\n\n- 3 targets: 48 frames\n\n- 4 targets: 64 frames\n\n- 5 targets: 80 frames\n\nWhen activated, the player can lock on to up to five opponents using a large reticle and fire a set of homing missiles at them.\n\nTenta Missiles can also locate and briefly track opponents; while aiming and firing, a crosshair will stay on all locked-on targets on the user's screen and will follow each target until all the missiles have reached their destination.\n\nAfter the special is activated and fired, markers appear to all players that show where the missiles land. If missiles are targeting a player, the player will see a ring with four, five, or ten arrows around their character showing how many missiles are still left. The number of missiles fired at each opponent differs based on how many have been targeted. If there is only one target, they will receive ten missiles. If there are two targets, they will each receive five missiles. If there are more than two targets, they will each receive four missiles.\n\nIt appears in 3 Octo Canyon Missions:\n\n- Return of the Octarians (Mission #1)\n\n- The Floating Garden (Mission #11)\n\n- Octoling Workout (Mission #27)\n\nEquipping Special Power Up with Tenta Missiles increases the targeting and paint radius of the missiles.\n\n- ▲ Increased damage dealt to opposing Ballers when shooting ink by roughly 50%.\n\n- ▲ Reduced the interval between missile launches when locked on to multiple targets in proportion to the number of targets.\n\n- ▲ Made it so that the player can press the  Button, enter Squid form[sic], and move around in the period between readying the weapon and firing it.\n\n- ▲ When locked on to a single target, 10 missiles will be launched at once, and will strike the area around the target.\n\n- ▲ When locked on to two targets, five missiles will now be launched, and the span of time between each launch has been decreased.\n\n- ▲ When the gear ability Special Power Up is equipped, in addition to the its other benefits, the radius of turf inked by missiles when they land has also been increased.\n\n- ▲ Tenta Missiles are now able to lock on to the barrier surrounding the Rainmaker.\n\n- ▼ Decreased damage dealt by each missile to the Rainmaker barrier by roughly 50%.\n\n- – Adjusted the position of the lock on indicator when targeting players, and made it easier to see how many missiles will be launched.\n\n- ▲ Shortened time between firing of each missile.\n▲ Missiles now always have a firing interval of 4 frames between shots.\n\n- ▲ Missiles now always have a firing interval of 4 frames between shots.\n\n- ▲ Missiles now always have a firing interval of 4 frames between shots.\n\n- ▲ Greatly increased the effect of the Special Power Up gear ability that increases ink coverage of missiles when they hit.\n\n- ▲ After shooting the missiles, decreased the recovery time before control is regained by 15/60 of a second.\n\n- Tenta Missiles title card.\n\n- A render of an Inkling with Tenta Missiles\n\n- An Inkling using the Tenta Missiles.\n\n- An inkling using the Tenta Missiles in the Splatoon 2 pre-launch trailer\n\n- Promotional render of Tenta Missiles.\n\n- An Inkling girl holding Tenta Missiles.\n\n- Artwork for Koshien 2020\n\nThe Tenta Missiles make a return in Splatoon 3. They were officially confirmed by the Splatoon 3 Direct on 10 August 2022. Starting from Chill Season 2022, the special gauge slowly depletes after the missiles are fired, and only when the gauge is empty again, can they be charged up again.\n\nIt appears in 5 Missions in Return of the Mammalians:\n\n- 0000 After Alterna\n\n- 0202 Absorbency and You\n\n- 0301 Climbing the Corporate Splatter\n\n- 0501 Uh-Oh!

In the Japanese dialogue it has been given the name \"Embrace Me ☆ Twinkle Star\" while in German it is called a \"swarm alarm\".\n\n- In Recon mode, apart from Rainmaker, Tenta Missiles cannot be launched due to not having targets to lock on to.\n\n- Prior to being confirmed in the Splatoon 3 Direct, the Tenta Missile's projectiles were first seen in one of the images from the announcement of Splatoon 3 as well as the Nintendo Switch OLED trailer. In the former, the E-liter 4K Scope can be seen around where the projectiles were fired. The Release Date Revealed trailer also shows that the icon for Special Power Up still depicts Tenta Missiles.\n\n- The missile launchers also resemble the M202 FLASH rocket launcher.\n\n- As of version 3.2.0, the Tenta Missiles fire ten missiles when used on one or two targets."
