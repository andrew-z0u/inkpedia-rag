    "The Tenta Missiles are a special weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3. They lock onto targets and launch guided missiles that strike from the sky.",
    "When activated, the Tenta Missiles' user brandishes two large missile launchers. The launchers are mainly yellow, and each consists of one main part on top that harbors four missile compartments and a smaller part on the bottom that only has one compartment. Each missile compartment changes color to match the user's ink. The Tenta Missiles themselves each look like water bottles filled with the user's team's ink. Activating the Tenta Missiles also displays a large circular reticle appears that shows the radius to acquire targets. Some horizontal lines in the user's ink color move up and down along the side of the screen, giving the whole display a more technological feel. When an opposing player is not locked onto or targeted, they appear as two pairs of lines, similar to a shooter's reticle that shows shot deviation. Hovering over a target causes an octagonal icon with an X to appear over them and plays a beep sound effect, which is higher-pitched when more targets are in the reticle. The octagon icon also persists when the missiles are fired on the acquired targets, allowing the user to see the targets for the entire duration of the special. An opposing player targeted by Tenta Missiles will see a ring around them in the Tenta Missile user's ink color with some small bottle icons. The number of bottle icons depends on how many missiles the opposing player is targeted with. The icon that appears to warn opposing players of incoming Tenta Missiles is a simple black circle with a ring of the Tenta Missile user's ink color around it.",
    "When activated, the player can lock on to up to five opponents using a large reticle and fire a set of homing missiles at them.",
    "Tenta Missiles can also locate and briefly track opponents; while aiming and firing, a crosshair will stay on all locked-on targets on the user's screen and will follow each target until all the missiles have reached their destination.",
    "After the special is activated and fired, markers appear to all players that show where the missiles land. If missiles are targeting a player, the player will see a ring with four, five, or ten arrows around their character showing how many missiles are still left. The number of missiles fired at each opponent differs based on how many have been targeted. If one player is targeted, they will receive ten missiles. If more than one player is locked on to, they will receive four missiles each.",

    "- According to one of the dialogues of Sturgeon Shipyard, shooting off Tenta Missiles just at the end of a match is called a \"dismissive diss missile\". In the Japanese dialogue it has been given the name \"Embrace Me â˜† Twinkle Star\" while in German it is called a \"swarm alarm\".",

In the former, the E-liter 4K Scope can be seen around where the projectiles were fired. The Release Date Revealed trailer also shows that the icon for Special Power Up still depicts Tenta Missiles."
