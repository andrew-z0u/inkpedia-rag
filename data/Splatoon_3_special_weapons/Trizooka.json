    "The Trizooka is a special weapon in Splatoon 3. It is a temporarily summoned weapon that fires three powerful arcing ink blasts.",
    "The Trizooka looks similar to the Inkzooka, but has a more industrial steampunk design, with some of the green and orange colors being replaced by gray or the user's ink color. Three ink tank capsules are attached to the Trizooka, which are ejected one by one when the Trizooka is fired.",
    "The Trizooka fires three big globs of ink in a single shot that orbit around each other and explode individually when they hit a surface. The globs do not leave a trail of ink, only painting a medium area on impact with a wall or the ground. The player is free to transform into swim form during its duration. Like the Triple Inkstrike, the Trizooka can only be fired three times before reverting to the main weapon. Despite its slow fire rate, it can be fired automatically. A Challenge that features the Trizooka exists, being Too Many Trizookas!.",
    "Trizooka has a startup that lasts for about 20 frames, and it takes about 15 frames for a shot to come out after the user fires. The user is then locked in place for 55 frames, during which they cannot move. If they choose to fire again during this time, they can fire another shot immediately after the 55 frame period ends without having to go through the 15 frame delay, allowing the Trizooka to be fired every 55 frames.",
    "Trizooka projectiles do not follow a parabola, rather they start out initially flying straight before slowing down and being affected by gravity (similar to most projectiles in the Splatoon series). Trizooka shots also have a smaller range of vertical firing angles, requiring the user to look further up or down to fire in the same vertical direction as a shooter would.",
    "The Trizooka projectiles are fired 4 frames apart from each other, but are angled 120 degrees apart from each other based on their positions in real time, not their spawn locations. This causes the effective hitbox of Trizooka to be flatter than one might expect[1][2].",
    "The hit detection of Trizooka shots are not based on what the user sees, but what the target sees[Citation needed]. This causes Trizooka projectiles to sometimes appear to pass through opponents without damaging them.",
