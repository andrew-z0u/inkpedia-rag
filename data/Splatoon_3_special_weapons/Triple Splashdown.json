The special works the same way as Splashdown, but the user summons two giant fists made of ink ahead and to either side of them to create two additional Splashdowns.\n\nThe fists will travel up slopes and over short walls, rising further to account for the level of the ground beneath them. However, they will be prevented from spreading out from the user's position by taller walls.\n\nThe fists are summoned at the user's position upon activation of the special and move outward over the course of 0.25 seconds, thus delaying their explosions by that amount, as they do not rise until they are in position. The user and fists each individually rise for 0.83 seconds before becoming invincible and descending to the ground[1]. If used on the ground, it takes about 10 frames for the user to descend fully, although this number can be increased if they use it from higher up.\n\nThe user as well as each of the fists can be shot down by opponents, but if any of them survive, they will complete a Splashdown even if the user is splatted. The fists have 100 HP each and have no different damage multipliers against different weapons. This makes the counterplay of the original Splashdown - simply shooting down the user - much more dangerous unless the opponent can fire from outside the Triple Splashdown's range or has very high firepower.\n\nWhen splatted during the Triple Splashdown's duration, the user retains a portion of their full special gauge, even if one or both of the fists complete the Splashdown.\n\nCompared to the original Splashdown, the Triple Splashdown deals far more damage overall and covers a wider, less predictable area. Its overall painting ability is similar to the original, but each individual Splashdown has reduced painting. It is also stronger against brellas and other shields, able to destroy the shield with one Splashdown and then splat the player behind it with the next.\n\nLike the Splashdown from the previous game, the player can use the special while Super Jumping to be invulnerable during the special, but the two fists will not be present.\n\nThis special is one of the nine available specials in Salmon Run Next Wave.\n\nEquipping Special Power Up with Triple Splashdown increases the radius of the ink splatter by up to 20% and damage radius by up to 10%.\n\n- — Fixed an issue that sometimes caused players who activated their Triple Splashdown special after performing certain actions to appear in a different location on the screens of other players.\n\n- ▲ Reduced the amount of time it takes for the player and ink fist to start dropping after they rise up by about 1/6th of a second: 70 frames → 60 frames.\n\n- ▼ Decreased the radius of the 60.0-damage explosion by approximately 13%: 12 units → 10.5 units.\n\n- ▲ Increased the radius inked by the explosion by approximately 11%: 9 units → 10 units.\n\nWinning a certain number of battles with the Triple Splashdown will reward the player with special badges that they can use on their Splashtag.\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- Alternate render\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- 2D icon used in Side Order\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of Triple Splashdown.\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Triple_Splashdown_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nModel of the Triple Splashdown rotating (link to file)\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Triple_Splashdown_demonstration.mp4\n\n\nTriple Splashdown in action (link to file)\n\n- Triple Splashdown is the third special weapon from a previous Splatoon series game that has been modified to fit the \"three\" theme prominent in Splatoon 3, after the Triple Inkstrike and Trizooka.\n\n- The Triple Splashdown was added to Salmon Run Next Wave before any weapon kits featuring it were released. It is currently the first and only special weapon with this distinction (including the original Salmon Run).\nAdditionally, when jobs were viewed in SplatNet 3, Triple Splashdown's icon was replaced by Trizooka's icon. This changed with the release of Chill Season 2023.\n\n- Additionally, when jobs were viewed in SplatNet 3, Triple Splashdown's icon was replaced by Trizooka's icon. This changed with the release of Chill Season 2023.\n\n- It was possible before version 6.0.1 to execute a glitch with Triple Splashdown causing the player to appear separated from the Triple Splashdown and, when executed near an edge, have the player fall and be splatted on one screen, and be fine on another, causing an invisible player glitch.\n\n- Additionally, when jobs were viewed in SplatNet 3, Triple Splashdown's icon was replaced by Trizooka's icon. This changed with the release of Chill Season 2023."
