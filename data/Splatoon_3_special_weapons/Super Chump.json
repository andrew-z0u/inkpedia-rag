The decoys the cannon shoots are colored in the player's ink color, and they are decorated with colorful dots and a smiling face. When the decoys are about to explode, they expand and flash, much like Suction Bombs.\n\nWhen activated, the user will begin aiming the cannon using a targeting oval. If the center of the oval is out-of-bounds, or the user is not on the ground, a \"Can't Use!\" warning will appear. Once a landing zone is set with , the cannon will wait for 1.5 seconds before it launches 12 decoys over the span of about 0.75 seconds. These decoys land in a random spread within the oval, displaying their landing sites as Super Jump markers with the names of random players on the user's team. It takes about 1.85 seconds for the decoys to land once they are launched.\n\nOnce they land, the decoys explode after 3.5 seconds, but they can be destroyed by enemy fire or crushed by moving terrain. Each chump has 60 HP and no different damage multipliers against different weapons, although equipping Object Shredder doubles the damage dealt to decoys. The user cannot charge their special gauge again until the gauge has fully depleted, which takes about 10.5 seconds.[1]\n\nEquipping Special Power Up with Super Chump increases the painting radius of the explosions by up to about 17% and the damage radius of the explosions by up to about 20%.\n\n- ▲ Increased the radius of ground inked when decoys drop by approximately 40%: 2 units → 2.8 units.\n\n- ▲ Increased the minimum damage dealt by decoy explosions from 25.0 to 35.0.\n\n- ▲ Made it possible to aim for nearer positions than before: 25 units → 18 units.\n\n- ▲ Increased the amount of damage dealt to players caught in an explosion near a decoy from 60.0 to 70.0 and increased the radius of that area by approximately 38%: 2.6 units → 3.6 units.\n\n- ▲ Increased the radius of the decoy explosion area that deals 35.0 damage by approximately 20%: 5 units → 6 units.\n\n- ▲ Reduced the time between decoys falling and exploding from about 4.0 seconds to about 3.5 seconds.\n\nWe know you want to see the Super Chump in action, so... check it out! Now, your enemy can destroy the decoys if they realize what's happening, but you can use that to your advantage. Get your OWN spot set up where you can camp on the campers while they try to take out your decoys!\n\nWinning a certain number of battles with the Super Chump will reward the player with special badges that they can use on their Splashtag.\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Super_Chump_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nSuper Chump bombs and launcher rotating\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Super_Chump_demonstration.mp4\n\n\nUsing the Super Chump\n\n- Promotional render\n\n- Two Super Chump bombs\n\n- Super Chump bomb swelling up to explode\n\n- Super Chump's marker, similar to the player's Super jump marker.\n\n- Super Chumps that have just been placed.\n\n- 2D icon.\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Super Chump.\n\nFor competitive tips about the Super Chump,\n\n- The Super Chump was first added in Fresh Season 2023 (Version 3.0.0).\nIt was originally datamined in the Drizzle Season 2022 as an unused special, codenamed \"firework\".\n\n- It was originally datamined in the Drizzle Season 2022 as an unused special, codenamed \"firework\".\n\n- The Super Chump's decoys resemble scaled-up versions of Suction Bombs. They even possess a \"face\" like the Suction Bomb, albeit with much more detail.\n\n- Similar to the Bomb Launcher, the Super Chump cannon plays a jingle while active.\n\n- If the player uses the Super Chump while touching and facing a wall, the cannon will appear to be inside of that wall.\nAlso, if the player uses the Super Chump when facing a ledge, the cannon will appear to be floating in the air once placed.\n\n- Also, if the player uses the Super Chump when facing a ledge, the cannon will appear to be floating in the air once placed.\n\n- It was originally datamined in the Drizzle Season 2022 as an unused special, codenamed \"firework\".\n\n- Also, if the player uses the Super Chump when facing a ledge, the cannon will appear to be floating in the air once placed.\n\nThe English name is a combination of \"Super Jump\" and \"chump\" (phonetically similar to \"Jump\" and referencing the decoy aspect). It may also be a reference to chum, a type of bait often used to lure sharks, fitting in with the sea theme of the Splatoon series."
