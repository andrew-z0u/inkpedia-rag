    "The Super Chump is a special weapon in Splatoon 3. It launches destructible decoys that Super Jump to a specified area and explode a short time after landing.",
    "When a player activates the Super Chump, they pull out a translucent cannon in their ink color. The decoys the cannon shoots are colored in the player's ink color, and they are decorated with colorful dots and a smiling face. When the decoys are about to explode, they expand and flash, much like Suction Bombs.",
    "When activated, the user will begin aiming the cannon using a targeting oval. If the center of the oval is out-of-bounds, or the user is not on the ground, a \"Can't Use!\" warning will appear. Once a landing zone is set with , the cannon will wait for 1.5 seconds before it launches 12 decoys over the span of about 0.75 seconds. These decoys land in a random spread within the oval, displaying their landing sites as Super Jump markers with the names of random players on the user's team. It takes about 1.85 seconds for the decoys to land once they are launched.",
    "Once they land, the decoys explode after 3.5 seconds, but they can be destroyed by enemy fire or crushed by moving terrain. Each chump has 60 HP and no different damage multipliers against different weapons, although equipping Object Shredder doubles the damage dealt to decoys. The user cannot charge their special gauge again until the gauge has fully depleted, which takes about 10.5 seconds.[1]",
    "Equipping Special Power Up with Super Chump increases the painting radius of the explosions by up to about 17% and the damage radius of the explosions by up to about 20%.",
    "We know you want to see the Super Chump in action, so... check it out! Now, your enemy can destroy the decoys if they realize what's happening, but you can use that to your advantage. Get your OWN spot set up where you can camp on the campers while they try to take out your decoys!",
    "Winning a certain number of battles with the Super Chump will reward the player with special badges that they can use on their Splashtag.",
    "For competitive tips about the Super Chump,",
    "The English name is a combination of \"Super Jump\" and \"chump\" (phonetically similar to \"Jump\" and referencing the decoy aspect). It may also be a reference to chum, a type of bait often used to lure sharks, fitting in with the sea theme of the Splatoon series.",
