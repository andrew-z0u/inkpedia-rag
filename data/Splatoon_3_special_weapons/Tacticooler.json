    "The Tacticooler is a special weapon in Splatoon 3. It is a deployable cooler with four empowering drinks, one for each member of the team. A player who gets a drink gains substantial, albeit temporary, buffs to their movement and respawn penalties.",
    "Before being thrown, the Tacticooler is shaped like a canned food container, consisting mostly of an unlit bulb in the player's ink color featuring a logo on all four sides. Once deployed, it unfolds into a beverage cooler that resembles a soda can, and the bulb lights up. Additionally, four short arms extend from the sides of the cooler, each holding a canned beverage to be taken by a member of the user's team. Each can is emblazoned with a stylized lightning bolt design, with the Tacticooler's logo and some illegible Inkling text below it. The reverse side of the can is decorated with a barcode and other miscellaneous symbols.",
    "The Tacticooler is used by placing a short, cylindrical object on the ground, which then expands into a standing beverage cooler that offers four soda cans for the user and their teammates. It also acts as unbreakable cover which blocks both teams' ink, but it will be destroyed if moving objects, terrain, or another Tacticooler come into contact with it. When the Tacticooler is deployed, it plays a short jingle that can be heard by the user's team, as well as any nearby enemies. The player and their allies can take up to one soda can each and drink it, granting these abilities for 17 seconds by default or until the recipient is splatted:[1][2][3][4][5]",
    "- Swim Speed Up (29 AP[1])",
    "- Run Speed Up (29 AP[1])",
    "- Intensify Action (57 AP)",
    "- Quick Super Jump (57 AP)",
    "- Quick Respawn (57 AP; applies regardless of whether the recipient splatted opponents during their current life[2])",
    "- Special Saver (57 AP)",
    "- Ink Resistance Up[6] (57 AP)",
    "The Tacticooler's effect does not stack with gear; whichever effect is stronger (gear or Tacticooler) will take priority. As a result, a player running any of these abilities will have the same effective AP as a player running none of them. This is especially important in the case of Swim Speed Up and Run Speed Up; if the player has at least 29 AP of the ability, that ability will not be boosted at all.[1][7] As a general rule, ability power is capped at 57 AP per ability; Tacticooler is not an exception, so using Tacticooler in combination with gear abilities will never produce a stronger effect than that of 57 AP for each ability.[8]",
    "If a player under the Tacticooler's effects gets splatted with Respawn Punisher, the punishing effect will stack with the respawn buffs. The Tacticooler's effects still apply to a player holding the Rainmaker.\nNotably, a player can only take a single drink from a given Tacticooler; if they are splatted and respawn after having a drink, they cannot take a second drink from that same Tacticooler. A player can also only pick up a drink while in walking form, never in swim form.",
    "If the player already has deployed a Tacticooler, then charges their special again while it is active, deploying the second Tacticooler will destroy the first. However, multiple teammates with Tacticoolers may deploy them at once without destroying each other's Tacticoolers.",
    "The duration of the Tacticooler stand is decreased by about 8 seconds when deployed on the Tower in Tower Control. The effects received from the drinks are unaffected by this.",
    "If the player deploys a Tacticooler, and their teammate takes a drink from it, a sign saying \"Refreshing!\" will show up above the said teammate on that player's screen.",
    "Equipping Special Power Up increases the maximum duration of the Tacticooler's drinks' effects to up to 25 seconds.",

    "For competitive tips about the Tacticooler",
    "- If a teammate who took a drink from a Tacticooler splats an opponent, it counts as an assist for the player who deployed the Tacticooler. This can be used to prolong Opening Gambit's effects, though Opening Gambit itself is somewhat redundant with the Tacticooler's buffs.",
    "- The Tacticooler grants similar effects to the Full Power-Up in the Battle Dojo from Splatoon.",
    "- If a player picks up a Tacticooler right after initiating a Super Jump but before they launch into the sky, the charge frames before the launch will not have the effects of Quick Super Jump, but the launch itself will. The inverse is also true if a player loses the effect right after initiating a Super Jump but before they launch into the sky, providing a quick charge time but slow launch time.",
    "The English name of the Tacticooler is a portmanteau of tactical and cooler. It may also be a reference to tacticool, an adjective describing clothing, weapons, or other equipment that resemble tactical equipment but are not.[11]"
