A player who gets a drink gains substantial, albeit temporary, buffs to their movement and respawn penalties.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Splatoon 3\n\n2.1 Special Power Up\n2.2 Version history\n2.3 Quotes\n2.4 Sets\n2.5 Audio\n2.6 Badges\n2.7 Gallery\n\n- 2.1 Special Power Up\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Sets\n\n- 2.5 Audio\n\n- 2.6 Badges\n\n- 2.7 Gallery\n\n- 3 Strategy\n\n- 4 Trivia\n\n- 5 Etymology\n\n5.1 Names In other languages\n\n- 5.1 Names In other languages\n\n- 6 References\n\n- 2.1 Special Power Up\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Sets\n\n- 2.5 Audio\n\n- 2.6 Badges\n\n- 2.7 Gallery\n\n- 5.1 Names In other languages\n\nBefore being thrown, the Tacticooler is shaped like a canned food container, consisting mostly of an unlit bulb in the player's ink color featuring a logo on all four sides. Once deployed, it unfolds into a beverage cooler that resembles a soda can, and the bulb lights up. Additionally, four short arms extend from the sides of the cooler, each holding a canned beverage to be taken by a member of the user's team. Each can is emblazoned with a stylized lightning bolt design, with the Tacticooler's logo and some illegible Inkling text below it. The reverse side of the can is decorated with a barcode and other miscellaneous symbols.\n\nThe Tacticooler is used by placing a short, cylindrical object on the ground, which then expands into a standing beverage cooler that offers four soda cans for the user and their teammates. It also acts as unbreakable cover which blocks both teams' ink, but it will be destroyed if moving objects, terrain, or another Tacticooler come into contact with it. When the Tacticooler is deployed, it plays a short jingle that can be heard by the user's team, as well as any nearby enemies. The player and their allies can take up to one soda can each and drink it, granting these abilities for 17 seconds by default or until the recipient is splatted:[1][2][3][4][5]\n\n- Swim Speed Up (29 AP[1])\n\n- Run Speed Up (29 AP[1])\n\n- Intensify Action (57 AP)\n\n- Quick Super Jump (57 AP)\n\n- Quick Respawn (57 AP; applies regardless of whether the recipient splatted opponents during their current life[2])\n\n- Special Saver (57 AP)\n\n- Ink Resistance Up[6] (57 AP)\n\nThe Tacticooler's effect does not stack with gear; whichever effect is stronger (gear or Tacticooler) will take priority. As a result, a player running any of these abilities will have the same effective AP as a player running none of them. This is especially important in the case of Swim Speed Up and Run Speed Up; if the player has at least 29 AP of the ability, that ability will not be boosted at all.[1][7] As a general rule, ability power is capped at 57 AP per ability; Tacticooler is not an exception, so using Tacticooler in combination with gear abilities will never produce a stronger effect than that of 57 AP for each ability.[8]\n\nIf a player under the Tacticooler's effects gets splatted with Respawn Punisher, the punishing effect will stack with the respawn buffs. The Tacticooler's effects still apply to a player holding the Rainmaker.\nNotably, a player can only take a single drink from a given Tacticooler; if they are splatted and respawn after having a drink, they cannot take a second drink from that same Tacticooler. A player can also only pick up a drink while in walking form, never in swim form.\n\nIf the player already has deployed a Tacticooler, then charges their special again while it is active, deploying the second Tacticooler will destroy the first. However, multiple teammates with Tacticoolers may deploy them at once without destroying each other's Tacticoolers.\n\nThe duration of the Tacticooler stand is decreased by about 8 seconds when deployed on the Tower in Tower Control. The effects received from the drinks are unaffected by this.\n\nIf the player deploys a Tacticooler, and their teammate takes a drink from it, a sign saying \"Refreshing!\" will show up above the said teammate on that player's screen.\n\nEquipping Special Power Up increases the maximum duration of the Tacticooler's drinks' effects to up to 25 seconds.\n\n- — Fixed an issue where a Tacticooler activating at the same moment a previously placed Tacticooler disappears would cause both to disappear.\n\n- — Fixed an issue where the appearance of a placed Tacticooler that inclines at an angle due to moving terrain would differ from its collision detection.\n\n- — Fixed an issue where, when a player is splatted directly before the effect runs out, the special gauge reduction would remain normal even though the player still has a shortened respawn time.\n\n- — Implemented measures to prevent players clipping into terrain when it is placed in certain corners.\n\n- — Fixed an issue in Clam Blitz where a Tacticooler placed on top of the clam basket would disappear.\n\n- ▲ Tacticooler's Quick Respawn and Special Saver will no longer be negated by gear abilities Respawn Punisher and Haunt.\nRespawn Punisher and Haunt effects (increase in respawn time and increase in amount of special gauge lost) will still occur.\n\n- Respawn Punisher and Haunt effects (increase in respawn time and increase in amount of special gauge lost) will still occur.\n\n- Respawn Punisher and Haunt effects (increase in respawn time and increase in amount of special gauge lost) will still occur.\n\n- — Fixed an issue where players between terrain and a Tacticooler could clip inside the terrain if the Tacticooler was set up in the corner of the terrain.\nDue to this change, you will now be able to pass through the Tacticooler - even in Inkling or Octoling form - while performing an action that causes you to move quickly, such as a Dodge Roll while using a dualie weapon.\n\n- Due to this change, you will now be able to pass through the Tacticooler - even in Inkling or Octoling form - while performing an action that causes you to move quickly, such as a Dodge Roll while using a dualie weapon.\n\n- Due to this change, you will now be able to pass through the Tacticooler - even in Inkling or Octoling form - while performing an action that causes you to move quickly, such as a Dodge Roll while using a dualie weapon.\n\n- ▲ Increased the initial setup speed when throwing the Tacticooler by roughly 33% to enable it to be set up farther than before.\nInitial velocity: 0.3 units/frame → 0.4 units/frame.\n\n- Initial velocity: 0.3 units/frame → 0.4 units/frame.\n\n- ▲ Roughly doubled the horizontal radius of the area where players can drink a beverage: 3.5 units → 7 units.\n\n- Initial velocity: 0.3 units/frame → 0.4 units/frame.\n\n- ▲ Extended the drink's effect duration by approximately 2 seconds when not equipped with the Special Power Up gear ability: 15s → 17s.\nThe effect duration gained from equipping the maximum number of Special Power Up gear abilities will not change.\n\n- The effect duration gained from equipping the maximum number of Special Power Up gear abilities will not change.\n\n- ▲ Made it easier to activate the effect from the Special Power Up gear ability, even when the player only has a few items with that gear ability equipped.\n\n- The effect duration gained from equipping the maximum number of Special Power Up gear abilities will not change.\n\n- ▼ Extended the cooldown time for the special gauge after placing a Tacticooler from 7.5 seconds to 10 seconds.\n\n- — Fixed an issue that caused Tacticoolers placed next to sponges to be destroyed unintentionally.\n\nYou know, it'll be easier to just share this footage we've obtained of a Tacticooler in action. Notice how it appears to function as an ad hoc shield! So rather than place the Tacticooler near a shady spot with a view, you might consider a strategic spot to launch your attack.\n\nSound when it has been placed:\n\nhttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:Tacticooler_Sfx.mp3\n\nWining a certain number of battles with the Tacticooler will reward the player with special badges that they can use on their Splashtag.\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- Another promotional image\n\n- Another promotional image\n\n- An earlier version of the Tacticooler icon.\n\n- 2D icon.\n\n- A Tacticooler's can locker decoration.\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Tacticooler.\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Tacticooler_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nTacticooler model rotating (link to file)\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Tacticooler_demonstration.mp4\n\n\nUsing the Tacticooler (link to file)\n\nFor competitive tips about the Tacticooler\n\n- If a teammate who took a drink from a Tacticooler splats an opponent, it counts as an assist for the player who deployed the Tacticooler. This can be used to prolong Opening Gambit's effects, though Opening Gambit itself is somewhat redundant with the Tacticooler's buffs.\n\n- The Tacticooler grants similar effects to the Full Power-Up in the Battle Dojo from Splatoon.\n\n- If a player picks up a Tacticooler right after initiating a Super Jump but before they launch into the sky, the charge frames before the launch will not have the effects of Quick Super Jump, but the launch itself will. The inverse is also true if a player loses the effect right after initiating a Super Jump but before they launch into the sky, providing a quick charge time but slow launch time.\n\nThe English name of the Tacticooler is a portmanteau of tactical and cooler. It may also be a reference to tacticool, an adjective describing clothing, weapons, or other equipment that resemble tactical equipment but are not.[11]"
