    "The Reefslider is a special weapon in Splatoon 3. It summons a ridden inflatable pool toy that quickly travels forward, splatting opponents on impact, and explodes, either when the user stops it or when its maximum distance is reached.",
    "The Reefslider is similar in appearance to an inflatable pool toy, with the overall design of a shark. The shark has a muzzle on its face, with black handles on its sides and a yellow saddle where the Inkling/Octoling sits, while soda bottles are attached to the base of the tail. The tips of its fins and its nose have dark gradients, possibly in reference to the blacktip reef shark.",
    "When activated, a straight path that appears resembles a pair of jetski buoy barriers.",
    "When activated, the user pulls out an inflatable toy shark and a straight path appears in the same direction as the camera is facing. The user then rides the toy shark, rushing across the straight path, splatting opponents upon contact. At the end of the path, the toy shark stops in place and lets out a blast of ink, splatting opponents in its radius. The explosion can also be triggered prematurely by colliding with the terrain or pressing . The Reefslider can pass through a Splattercolor Screen without the user losing color perception.",
    "Upon activation, the user undergoes an animation lasting for 38 frames, although they gain invincibility 25 frames after the start of the animation. Once this animation is done, the user begins to move forward. Notably, the animation does not start unless the user is grounded, and the direction of the Reefslider is only chosen once the animation starts. Thus, if the Reefslider is used in midair, the user can change its direction before landing. However, this delays the movement of the Reefslider as well as its invincibility, as the animation time must complete before it starts moving.",
    "During the riding animation, the Reefslider moves very quickly in a straight line for up to 1 second unless interrupted by the player or an obstacle in its path. If unobstructed, it can at most move about the same distance in which the E-liter 4K can shoot. The player cannot interrupt the Reefslider for the first 15 frames of its movement, and the Reefslider also moves slower while airborne.",
    "Once the explosion is triggered, the Reefslider rapidly decelerates into a stop before exploding. It takes 38 frames for the Reefslider to explode after the explosion is triggered. After the explosion, the user is locked in place for 28 frames, during which they have full invincibility[1].",
    "This special is one of the nine available specials in Salmon Run Next Wave.",
    "It appears in four Return of the Mammalians missions:",
    "Equipping Special Power Up with Reefslider increases the damage and painting radius of its explosion by up to 20% each.",
    "Salmon Run Next Wave:",
    "Linguistics just informed us that \"Weapon Wednesday\" isn't a thing. To make up for this misstep, here's footage of the Reefslider in action! Notice the brief moment of vulnerability at activation, followed by invulnerability until detonation. And no steering! Aim carefully...",
    "Wining a certain number of battles with the Reefslider will reward the player with special badges that they can use on their Splashtag.",
    "The \"Reef\" in \"Reefslider\" may be derived from the name of the blacktip reef shark.",
