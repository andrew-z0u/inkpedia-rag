    "The Splattercolor Screen is a special weapon in Splatoon 3. It is a canister which creates a large, mobile ink sheet causing slight damage and visual dampening.",
    "The Splattercolor Screen, when activated, generates a clear canister filled with swirled ink, resembling a bottle of bubble solution. When thrown, the canister deploys a large, thin arch-shaped bow of the user's ink color which inks the ground as it slowly moves forward. The ink is held in shape by two plastic structures resembling straws on either side. The ink screen also produces bubbles as it moves. The ink screen has a swirled or marbled pattern and translucent portions which look like the product of the Japanese paper marbling technique suminagashi (墨流し).",
    "The Splattercolor Screen was first added to Splatoon 3 in Chill Season 2023 (version 6.0.0).",
    "When activated, the user will produce a small canister that can be thrown with  to produce the sheet on impact. As the sheet moves, enemies passing through it will take damage and trigger the visual dampening, causing the screen to darken and become monochromatic.",
    "The visual dampening is not directly tied to whether the player actually takes damage and cannot be avoided by armor (for example from the Squid Roll), but can be avoided by moving through the sheet with full invincibility (for example, while riding the Reefslider).",
    "Additionally, although the Splattercolor Screen is not actually a solid object, the opaque parts are still treated as such for the purpose of Thermal Ink and Haunt. Consequently, any enemies affected by these abilities may be seen through these parts of the sheet.",
    "Equipping Special Power Up with Splattercolor Screen increases the throwing range of the creation device and speed at which the screen travels.",
    "It's called the Splattercolor Screen, and it forms a massive wall! Now, anyone can walk through the wall, but enemies that do so will lose the ability to see color.",
    "Winning a certain number of battles with the Splattercolor Screen will reward the player with special badges that they can use on their Splashtag.",
    "Derived from splattercolor, which is a pun on watercolor, and splatter screen which refers to a protective mesh that prevents hot oil from splashing.",
