When thrown, the canister deploys a large, thin arch-shaped bow of the user's ink color which inks the ground as it slowly moves forward. The ink is held in shape by two plastic structures resembling straws on either side. The ink screen also produces bubbles as it moves. The ink screen has a swirled or marbled pattern and translucent portions which look like the product of the Japanese paper marbling technique suminagashi (墨流し).\n\nThe Splattercolor Screen was first added to Splatoon 3 in Chill Season 2023 (version 6.0.0).\n\nWhen activated, the user will produce a small canister that can be thrown with  to produce the sheet on impact. As the sheet moves, enemies passing through it will take damage and trigger the visual dampening, causing the screen to darken and become monochromatic.\n\nThe visual dampening is not directly tied to whether the player actually takes damage and cannot be avoided by armor (for example from the Squid Roll), but can be avoided by moving through the sheet with full invincibility (for example, while riding the Reefslider).\n\nAdditionally, although the Splattercolor Screen is not actually a solid object, the opaque parts are still treated as such for the purpose of Thermal Ink and Haunt. Consequently, any enemies affected by these abilities may be seen through these parts of the sheet.\n\nEquipping Special Power Up with Splattercolor Screen increases the throwing range of the creation device and speed at which the screen travels.\n\n- — Adjusted the change in color when affected by the Splattercolor Screen to make it more natural. The screen brightness of the effect itself has also been dimmed.\n\n- ▲ Increased the damage dealt to opponents who touch the screen from 30.0 to 40.0.\n\n- ▲ Increased the damage dealt to the following when touched by the screen:\nSquid Beakon: 1x → 100x.\nSprinkler: 1x → 100x.\nSplash Wall: 1x → 3x.\nSponge: 1x → 3x.\nRainmaker shield: 1x → 3x.\n\n- Squid Beakon: 1x → 100x.\n\n- Sprinkler: 1x → 100x.\n\n- Splash Wall: 1x → 3x.\n\n- Sponge: 1x → 3x.\n\n- Rainmaker shield: 1x → 3x.\n\n- Squid Beakon: 1x → 100x.\n\n- Sprinkler: 1x → 100x.\n\n- Splash Wall: 1x → 3x.\n\n- Sponge: 1x → 3x.\n\n- Rainmaker shield: 1x → 3x.\n\nIt's called the Splattercolor Screen, and it forms a massive wall! Now, anyone can walk through the wall, but enemies that do so will lose the ability to see color.\n\nWinning a certain number of battles with the Splattercolor Screen will reward the player with special badges that they can use on their Splashtag.\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- Alternate promotional image\n\n- Blueprint for the Splattercolor Screen\n\n- 2D icon.\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of Splattercolor Screen.\n\n- The Thermal Ink/Haunt effect as seen through the Splattercolor Screen.\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Splattercolor_Screen_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nModel of the Splattercolor Screen rotating (link to file)\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Splattercolor_Screen_demonstration.mp4\n\n\nThe Splattercolor Screen shown in action (link to file)\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Splattercolor_Screen_Effect_Version_6_0_1.mp4\n\n\nThe Splattercolor Screen effects in version 6.0.1 (link to file)\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Splattercolor_Screen_Effect_Version_6_0_2.mp4\n\n\nThe Splattercolor Screen effects after the changes in version 6.0.2 (link to file)\n\n- Splattercolor Screen was accidentally listed as a sub weapon during the Snipewriter 5B's reveal on social media due to translation issues between the English and Japanese Twitter accounts.[2]\n\nDerived from splattercolor, which is a pun on watercolor, and splatter screen which refers to a protective mesh that prevents hot oil from splashing."
