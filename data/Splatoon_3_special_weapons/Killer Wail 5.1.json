    "The Killer Wail 5.1 is a special weapon in Splatoon 3. It fires a series of six prolonged lasers in the user's ink color that pierce through walls and automatically track opponents.",
    "The Killer Wail 5.1 consists of six floating speakers, in contrast to the original Killer Wail's singular megaphone. Each speaker is identical and will fire a sound wave beam similar to the Killer Wail's but much narrower. The back of each speaker holds a can of spray paint, which bears a strong resemblance to that of the Suction Bomb.",
    "When activated, six flying speakers spawn in a vertical hexagon formation and follow the user. The user can then target opponents one at a time by facing the camera in their direction, indicated by a reticle. By switching targets after the previous pair has locked on, each pair of speakers can be locked onto a different opponent. If there is no targeted opponent when a speaker pair activates, the speakers simply point in the camera's direction and fire. Each individual speaker will then choose randomly to either rotate left or right for its duration.",
    "The speakers activate two at a time and from top to bottom in roughly .5 second intervals, each firing a narrow, wall-piercing beam that deals damage to opponents that touch them. Once they start firing, the speakers float in place and rotate, tracking locked-on opponents' movement roughly half a second behind their current position. The speakers have their own individual durations, each lasting for 3 seconds after activation.",
    "The speakers all deal damage individually, at 3.5 damage per 5 frames, or 42 damage per second. Hence, being caught in the beams of 2 lasers deals 7 damage every 5 frames, for 84 damage per second, and being caught in the beams of all 6 lasers deals 21 damage every 5 frames for a total of 252 damage per second[1].",
    "If a locked-on opponent is splatted, the speakers will continue to rotate continuously in the same direction as they were before the target was splatted. If a locked-on opponent is splatted before the speakers begin firing, they will turn to face the target's last location before choosing to rotate as if there was no target.",
    "This special is one of the nine available specials in Salmon Run Next Wave. In this mode, the Killer Wail 5.1 deals 15 damage every 10 frames, and can deal piercing damage, making it able to splat armored bosses such as Steelheads and Drizzlers.",
    "Equipping Special Power Up with Killer Wail 5.1 increases the individual firing duration of each laser to up to 4 seconds.",
    "Winning a certain number of battles with the Killer Wail 5.1 will reward the player with special badges that they can use on their Splashtag.",
    "For competitive tips about the Killer Wail 5.1",
    "\"Killer Wail 5.1\" is a combination of \"Killer Wail\" (which in turn is a portmanteau of \"killer whale\" and \"wail\"), and 5.1 surround sound system. \"Wail\" references its method of splatting opponents, while 5.1 (the most common format for surround sound systems) references its plural speakers. Notably, both Wii U and Nintendo Switch support 5.1 output.",
