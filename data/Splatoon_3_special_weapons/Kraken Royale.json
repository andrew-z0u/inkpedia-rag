Compared to swim form, its tentacles are longer and its head is larger. Its body is slightly darker than the user's ink color, with lighter patterns at the end of its tentacles and head. Unlike its Splatoon counterpart, Octolings can use the special as well, transforming them into the octopus equivalent, which also has longer tentacles and a much bigger head.\n\nThe Kraken Royale was first added to Splatoon 3 in Fresh Season 2023 (version 3.0.0).\n\nThe Kraken Royale is very similar to its predecessor. While active, the user constantly remains in swim form, can swim on top of enemy ink unobstructed, and inks the ground by moving over it, although they cannot submerge in ink. By jumping, the user performs a spinning attack that can splat a foe in two hits.\n\nA new ability of the Kraken Royale is a charge attack, similar to a horizontal Squid Surge. After holding  for a brief period (35 frames) and releasing, the user lunges forward at increased speed for 35 frames, inking the ground and instantly splatting any foe in the way. The user cannot control the direction of the dash once it starts, although they can freely select the direction while charging. The user can still move while charging a dash, albeit very slowly.\n\nLike its predecessor, the Kraken Royale is invincible, but takes knockback if hit. While charging the dash, the user suffers normal knockback, however, once the attack is fully charged (but not yet released), the user suffers reduced knockback. While dashing, however, the user suffers no knockback. If the user is on the tower in Tower Control, they will suffer greatly increased knockback.\n\nNotably, the user is completely vulnerable for a full second upon the special's activation and end, although the activation animation plays faster for other players[1].\n\nThis special is one of the nine available specials in Salmon Run Next Wave. It was added to Salmon Run along with the Triple Splashdown special in version 6.0.0. It is able to pierce through armored enemies such as Drizzlers, Steelheads, and Flyfish with its jump and charge attacks.\n\nEquipping Special Power Up with Kraken Royale increases its duration to up to 10 seconds.\n\n- ▼ Made it easier for a player to be pushed back by an enemy attack in Tower Control mode when the player is on the tower.\n\n- ▼ Made it so that a player will drop all their clams and power clams wherever they are when they use this special in Clam Blitz mode.\n\n- — Fixed an issue that enabled players to do a Squid Surge or Squid Roll during the period when player actions were supposed to be disabled after the effects from the Kraken Royale wore off.\n\n- ▲ Movement speed while not charged is now roughly 11% faster: 10.368 units/s → 11.52 units/s.\n\n- ▼ Made it so that Super Jumping to an ally using Kraken Royale will Super Jump to the location where that ally started using Kraken Royale rather than the ally's current position.\n\n- ▼ Increased the amount of time to finish charging up a charge attack by about 1/12th of a second: 30 frames → 35 frames.\n\nNotice a moment of vulnerability before and after transforming - contrasted with total invincibility while transformed! Still, attacks slow you down, so get slippery with jumps, charges, Squid Surges, and Squid Rolls to reach your target.\n\nWinning a certain number of battles with the Kraken Royale will reward the player with special badges that they can use on their Splashtag.\n\n- An Inkling's Kraken Royale\n\n- An Octoling's Kraken Royale\n\n- The Kraken Royale on the Fresh Season 2023 catalog cover\n\n- 2D icon.\n\n- 2D icon used in Side Order\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Kraken Royale.\n\n- A Kraken compared to an Inkling.\n\n- Octoling's Kraken form compared to an Inkling's swim form.\n\n- A Inkling's Kraken form compared to an Octoling's swim form.\n\n- Both Kraken Royale forms side by side.\n\n- The Kraken Royale that is visible on the battle results screen.\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Kraken_Royale_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nKraken Royale models rotating (link to file)\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Kraken_Royale_demonstration.mp4\n\n\nUsing the Kraken Royale (link to file)\n\nFor competitive tips about the Kraken Royale,\n\n- Unlike its predecessor in Splatoon, Kraken Royale is unaffected by most gear abilities other than Special Power Up, and cannot Super Jump.\n\n- All of the first three Kraken Royale weapons were weapons whose Splatoon counterpart had Kraken and their corresponding sub weapon.\n\n- The Kraken in the original Splatoon had a fully playable, but unused Octoling variant hidden in the game files. With the release of Kraken Royale in Fresh Season 2023 an Octoling variant became playable for the first time.\n\nRoyale is an alternative spelling of \"royal\", likely meant to create a similar air to the Japanese name of the weapon."
