    "The Kraken Royale is a special weapon in Splatoon 3. It transforms the user into a nearly invincible giant squid/octopus that is capable of jump attacks and charge attacks.",
    "The Kraken Royale transforms the user into a huge squid or octopus, depending on the user's species. Compared to swim form, its tentacles are longer and its head is larger. Its body is slightly darker than the user's ink color, with lighter patterns at the end of its tentacles and head. Unlike its Splatoon counterpart, Octolings can use the special as well, transforming them into the octopus equivalent, which also has longer tentacles and a much bigger head.",
    "The Kraken Royale was first added to Splatoon 3 in Fresh Season 2023 (version 3.0.0).",
    "The Kraken Royale is very similar to its predecessor. While active, the user constantly remains in swim form, can swim on top of enemy ink unobstructed, and inks the ground by moving over it, although they cannot submerge in ink. By jumping, the user performs a spinning attack that can splat a foe in two hits.",
    "A new ability of the Kraken Royale is a charge attack, similar to a horizontal Squid Surge. After holding  for a brief period (35 frames) and releasing, the user lunges forward at increased speed for 35 frames, inking the ground and instantly splatting any foe in the way. The user cannot control the direction of the dash once it starts, although they can freely select the direction while charging. The user can still move while charging a dash, albeit very slowly.",
    "Like its predecessor, the Kraken Royale is invincible, but takes knockback if hit. While charging the dash, the user suffers normal knockback, however, once the attack is fully charged (but not yet released), the user suffers reduced knockback. While dashing, however, the user suffers no knockback. If the user is on the tower in Tower Control, they will suffer greatly increased knockback.",
    "Notably, the user is completely vulnerable for a full second upon the special's activation and end, although the activation animation plays faster for other players[1].",
    "This special is one of the nine available specials in Salmon Run Next Wave. It was added to Salmon Run along with the Triple Splashdown special in version 6.0.0. It is able to pierce through armored enemies such as Drizzlers, Steelheads, and Flyfish with its jump and charge attacks.",
    "Equipping Special Power Up with Kraken Royale increases its duration to up to 10 seconds.",
    "Notice a moment of vulnerability before and after transforming - contrasted with total invincibility while transformed! Still, attacks slow you down, so get slippery with jumps, charges, Squid Surges, and Squid Rolls to reach your target.",
    "Winning a certain number of battles with the Kraken Royale will reward the player with special badges that they can use on their Splashtag.",
    "For competitive tips about the Kraken Royale,",
    "Royale is an alternative spelling of \"royal\", likely meant to create a similar air to the Japanese name of the weapon.",
