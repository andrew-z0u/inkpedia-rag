    "The Tri-Stringer is a main weapon in Splatoon 3. It was initially shown in the announcement trailer for Splatoon 3 on 17 February 2021,[1] and its name was revealed on 22 April 2022.[2]",
    "The Tri-Stringer resembles a bow and arrow or a miniature ballista but made out of parts of a fishing rod, including a reel and string.[3] The reel is attached to a mechanism including three tubes, with the one in the center resembling a pump. The tubes and the string change color to match the player's ink.",
    "When the Tri-Stringer is fired with a tap of , it launches three projectiles of ink, each dealing 30 damage. The Tri-Stringer can shoot horizontally or vertically, depending on whether the user is jumping or not (in either case, the projectiles will travel in an arc and can be used to easily target areas behind cover). The Tri-Stringer is also capable of charging its shots and incorporates elements of both chargers and splatlings. Like chargers, the weapon has a telltale glow when charged and fires once for each release of . However, unlike chargers, there is no visible laser sight, making it difficult to tell where a Tri-Stringer user is aiming. Much like splatlings, however, the weapon also possesses two rings indicating its charge: these signify the points at which its shots become strongest and fly furthest & closest together, respectively. To fire the weapon, the user pulls back on the string, which changes color depending on the user's ink, and then releases it after a short period.[4]",
    "If the weapon has been charged sufficiently (at least one ring of charge), the Tri-Stringer will shoot three projectiles resembling frozen popsicles which will explode after a few seconds. The ink tanks on the weapon and the bowstring seem to light up for a short period after being fired.",
    "Its kit consists of Toxic Mist and Killer Wail 5.1.",
    "It appears in six missions in Return of the Mammalians:",

    "- When all shots from one charge of the weapon hit a single opponent, and they deal over 100.0 damage total, a special hit sound effect plays, accompanied by a visible flash.\nThis effect is shared with the H-3 Nozzlenose, REEF-LUX 450, and Wellstring V families.\nThis effect does not occur in Salmon Run Next Wave.",

    "- Despite being the first weapon entry in the stringer weapon class, the expected weapon ID of 7000 is not used, and instead the weapon's internal ID lists it as 7010 as if it were the second entry in the weapon class."
