The tubes and the string change color to match the player's ink.\n\nWhen the Tri-Stringer is fired with a tap of , it launches three projectiles of ink, each dealing 30 damage. The Tri-Stringer can shoot horizontally or vertically, depending on whether the user is jumping or not (in either case, the projectiles will travel in an arc and can be used to easily target areas behind cover). The Tri-Stringer is also capable of charging its shots and incorporates elements of both chargers and splatlings. Like chargers, the weapon has a telltale glow when charged and fires once for each release of . However, unlike chargers, there is no visible laser sight, making it difficult to tell where a Tri-Stringer user is aiming. Much like splatlings, however, the weapon also possesses two rings indicating its charge: these signify the points at which its shots become strongest and fly furthest & closest together, respectively. To fire the weapon, the user pulls back on the string, which changes color depending on the user's ink, and then releases it after a short period.[4]\n\nIf the weapon has been charged sufficiently (at least one ring of charge), the Tri-Stringer will shoot three projectiles resembling frozen popsicles which will explode after a few seconds. The ink tanks on the weapon and the bowstring seem to light up for a short period after being fired.\n\nIts kit consists of Toxic Mist and Killer Wail 5.1.\n\nIt appears in six missions in Return of the Mammalians:\n\n- 0109 The String's the Thing\n\n- 0404 Splash the Block Party\n\n- 0504 Barriers! They've Got You Covered\n\n- 0507 One-Way Ride through Target Town\n\n- 0510 Shooter on Rails\n\n- 0608 Breathe In, Breathe Out\n\n- The Tri-Stringer is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 25. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The Tri-Stringer fires 3 arrows per shot.\n\n- Ink consumption scales with charge level. It starts at 5% of the ink tank at no charge, 6% of the ink tank at one charge circle, and 8.5% of the ink tank at full charge.\n\n- The Tri-Stringer cannot store its charge.\n\n- If charged to the first circle or higher, the shots become explosive.\nThe shots explode after 45 frames (0.75 seconds), dealing 30 damage to players with a 2.0 unit radius.\n\n- The shots explode after 45 frames (0.75 seconds), dealing 30 damage to players with a 2.0 unit radius.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with players has a radius of 0.18 units.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with the environment has a radius of 0.2 units.\n\n- The weapon cannot fire until it has charged for 9 frames. The first circle is reached after charging for 30 frames (0.5 seconds), and full charge is reached after 72 frames (1.2 seconds).\n\n- After firing, there is a delay before another shot can be charged. This delay is 12 frames at no charge, 15 frames at one charge circle, and 15 frames at full charge.\n\n- The delay between firing a shot (charged or uncharged) and submerging in ink is 10 frames.\nWhen charging while out of ink, the amount of time it takes to charge is multiplied by 3. When charging in the air, the time it takes to charge is also multiplied by 3.\n\n- When charging while out of ink, the amount of time it takes to charge is multiplied by 3. When charging in the air, the time it takes to charge is also multiplied by 3.\n\n- The movement speed while charging is set to 0.068 units per frame.\n\n- The shots explode after 45 frames (0.75 seconds), dealing 30 damage to players with a 2.0 unit radius.\n\n- When charging while out of ink, the amount of time it takes to charge is multiplied by 3. When charging in the air, the time it takes to charge is also multiplied by 3.\n\n- After firing, there is a 20 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Initial shot velocity scales with charge level. It starts at 2.1 units per frame at no charge, 2.1 units per frame at one charge circle, and 3.85 at full charge.\nShots travel straight for 4 frames, regardless of charge level.\nThe effective range is 13.01 units at no charge, 13.01 units at one charge circle, and 23.7 units at full charge.\nThis number represents the range in which the crosshair changes shape when placed over an enemy. However, since stringer weapons do not have damage falloff, these numbers are otherwise arbitrary.\n\n- Shots travel straight for 4 frames, regardless of charge level.\n\n- The effective range is 13.01 units at no charge, 13.01 units at one charge circle, and 23.7 units at full charge.\nThis number represents the range in which the crosshair changes shape when placed over an enemy.

It starts at 30 damage at no charge, 35 damage at one charge circle, and 35 at full charge.\n\n- Arrow angle changes with charge level. It starts at 8.0 degrees at no charge, 8 degrees at one charge circle, and 0 degrees at full charge.\n\n- The arrows fire 0.4 units apart from each other.\n\n- Shots travel straight for 4 frames, regardless of charge level.\n\n- The effective range is 13.01 units at no charge, 13.01 units at one charge circle, and 23.7 units at full charge.\nThis number represents the range in which the crosshair changes shape when placed over an enemy.

Behold the Tri-Stringer—a stringer-type weapon that fires in three directions at once! Press  while standing or running, and the ink will fire horizontally. Press  while jumping for a shot that's concentrated vertically. The flexibility is unparalleled! And that's not even the best part. You can hold down  to charge a shot! The ink will fly farther AND explode if it hits a wall or the floor. I could go on all day about stringers, but I should mention that the Toxic Mist sub is great for keeping enemies at bay, or at least slowing them down. And for enemies that you can't even reach with a charged shot, you've got the Killer Wail 5.1 with supersonic range at your disposal. I hope you'll give one of the new stringers a try!\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- An Inkling holding the Tri-Stringer\n\n- The Tri-Stringer being fired while jumping\n\n- The Tri-Stringer being fired by an Inkling jumping on a grate\n\n- The Tri-Stringer charging its shot\n\n- The Inkling furthest to the left is holding the Tri-Stringer.\n\n- An Inkling readying the Tri-Stringer to fire\n\n- Key art with the Tri-Stringer\n\n- Horizontal key art with the Tri-Stringer\n\n- Icon with the Tri-Stringer\n\n- Render of an Inkling with the Tri-Stringer\n\n- An Octoling using the Tri-Stringer\n\n- Held by the Inkling on the right\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Tri-Stringer.\n\n- The Tri-Stringer on the left, representing Team Wisdom in the Power vs. Wisdom vs. Courage Splatfest.\n\n- Splat logo on the Tri-Stringer despite being made by another brand.\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Gameplay_Clip_Switch_OLED_Announcement_Trailer.mp4\n\n\nEarly footage of the Tri-Stringer being used in Splatoon 3 gameplay.
