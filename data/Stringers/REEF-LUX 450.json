The bottle at the tip also shares similarities to a yakult bottle. The bottle changes color to match the player's ink.\n\nThe REEF-LUX 450 was first shown in a Salmon Run gameplay video[1] before being officially announced or seen in-game. Compared to the Tri-Stringer, it is faster, lightweight, has a shorter range, has non-explosive shots and can hold a full charge for a short while in swim form.\n\nWhile the weapon image and data for the REEF-LUX 450 could not be found in the files for the Splatoon 3 Splatfest World Premiere, dataminers were able to locate Sheldon's description of the weapon, which also names the sub and special weapons in its kit. It was officially announced on 6 September 2022.[2]\n\n- The REEF-LUX 450 is a lightweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 15. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The REEF-LUX 450 fires 3 arrows per shot.\n\n- Ink consumption scales with charge level. It starts at 3.5% of the ink tank at no charge, 4.68% of the ink tank at one charge circle, and 6.5% of the ink tank at full charge.\n\n- The REEF-LUX 450 can store its charge while submerged in ink.\nA stored charge can be held for up to 75 frames (1.25 seconds). The animation of coming out of a stored charge lasts for 21 frames, and a shot can be fired 27 frames after coming out of ink.\n\n- A stored charge can be held for up to 75 frames (1.25 seconds). The animation of coming out of a stored charge lasts for 21 frames, and a shot can be fired 27 frames after coming out of ink.\n\n- Shots fired by the REEF-LUX 450 do not explode.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with players has a radius of 0.18 units.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with the environment has a radius of 0.2 units.\n\n- The weapon cannot fire until it has charged for 6 frames. The first circle is reached after charging for 12 frames (0.2 seconds), and full charge is reached after 34 frames (0.57 seconds).\n\n- After firing, there is a delay before another shot can be charged. This delay is 8 frames at no charge, 15 frames at one charge circle, and 15 frames at full charge.\n\n- The delay between firing a shot (charged or uncharged) and submerging in ink is 10 frames.\nWhen charging while out of ink, the amount of time it takes to charge is multiplied by 3. The charge speed while airborne is the same as the charge speed on the ground.\n\n- When charging while out of ink, the amount of time it takes to charge is multiplied by 3. The charge speed while airborne is the same as the charge speed on the ground.\n\n- The movement speed while charging is set to 0.084 units per frame.\n\n- A stored charge can be held for up to 75 frames (1.25 seconds). The animation of coming out of a stored charge lasts for 21 frames, and a shot can be fired 27 frames after coming out of ink.\n\n- When charging while out of ink, the amount of time it takes to charge is multiplied by 3. The charge speed while airborne is the same as the charge speed on the ground.\n\n- After firing, there is a 20 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Initial shot velocity scales with charge level. It starts at 1.45 units per frame at no charge, 1.45 units per frame at one charge circle, and 2.55 at full charge.\nShots travel straight for 4 frames, regardless of charge level.\nThe effective range is 8.56 units at no charge, 8.56 units at one charge circle, and 14.91 units at full charge.\nThis number represents the range in which the crosshair changes shape when placed over an enemy. However, since stringer weapons do not have damage falloff, these numbers are otherwise arbitrary.\n\n- Shots travel straight for 4 frames, regardless of charge level.\n\n- The effective range is 8.56 units at no charge, 8.56 units at one charge circle, and 14.91 units at full charge.\nThis number represents the range in which the crosshair changes shape when placed over an enemy.

It starts at 30 damage at no charge, 45 damage at one charge circle, and 45 at full charge.\n\n- Arrow angle changes with charge level. It starts at 10.5 degrees at no charge, 5 degrees at one charge circle, and 0.5 degrees at full charge.\n\n- The arrows fire 0.2 units apart from each other.\n\n- Shots travel straight for 4 frames, regardless of charge level.\n\n- The effective range is 8.56 units at no charge, 8.56 units at one charge circle, and 14.91 units at full charge.\nThis number represents the range in which the crosshair changes shape when placed over an enemy.

Like most lightweight weapons, it doesn't pack the biggest punch or range—no exploding charged shots here—but it does offer the ability to store a charge! This set comes with Curling Bombs to help you close the gap into enemy turf quickly, letting you take full advantage of the nimble nature of your main weapon. And when you want to make a big impact in a hurry, don't forget about your Tenta Missiles. You can make it rain missiles on opponents out of range of the REEF-LUX. This is a highly mobile loadout that lets you fight with flexibility and still take down powerhouse opponents. I hope you give it a try!\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the REEF-LUX 450\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_REEF-LUX_450_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nModel of the REEF-LUX 450 rotating (link to file)\n\nFor competitive tips about the REEF-LUX 450\n\n- The REEF-LUX 450 is one of only two weapons introduced at the game's launch to not appear in any of the missions in Return of the Mammalians, with other being the Splatana Wiper.\n\n- When all shots from one charge of the weapon hit a single opponent, and they deal over 100.0 damage total, a special hit sound effect plays, accompanied by a visible flash.\nThis effect is shared with the H-3 Nozzlenose, Tri-Stringer, and Wellstring V families.\nThis effect does not occur in Salmon Run Next Wave.\n\n- This effect is shared with the H-3 Nozzlenose, Tri-Stringer, and Wellstring V families.\n\n- This effect does not occur in Salmon Run Next Wave.\n\n- When being taught how to use Tenta Missiles in Judd's trials, the player is equipped with the REEF-LUX 450.\n\n- This effect is shared with the H-3 Nozzlenose, Tri-Stringer, and Wellstring V families.\n\n- This effect does not occur in Salmon Run Next Wave.\n\nREEF-LUX is a play on \"reflex bow\", \"reef\", and possibly \"acid reflux\" and \"deluxe\".\n\n\"450\" refers to the 45 damage the weapon deals per shot."
