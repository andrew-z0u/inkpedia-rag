    "The REEF-LUX 450 is a main weapon in Splatoon 3.",
    "The REEF-LUX 450 appears to be based on a knot assist, a tool used for fishing, and a compound bow. The bottle at the tip also shares similarities to a yakult bottle. The bottle changes color to match the player's ink.",
    "The REEF-LUX 450 was first shown in a Salmon Run gameplay video[1] before being officially announced or seen in-game. Compared to the Tri-Stringer, it is faster, lightweight, has a shorter range, has non-explosive shots and can hold a full charge for a short while in swim form.",
    "While the weapon image and data for the REEF-LUX 450 could not be found in the files for the Splatoon 3 Splatfest World Premiere, dataminers were able to locate Sheldon's description of the weapon, which also names the sub and special weapons in its kit. It was officially announced on 6 September 2022.[2]",

    "- The REEF-LUX 450 is one of only two weapons introduced at the game's launch to not appear in any of the missions in Return of the Mammalians, with other being the Splatana Wiper.",
    "- When all shots from one charge of the weapon hit a single opponent, and they deal over 100.0 damage total, a special hit sound effect plays, accompanied by a visible flash.\nThis effect is shared with the H-3 Nozzlenose, Tri-Stringer, and Wellstring V families.\nThis effect does not occur in Salmon Run Next Wave.",
    "- When being taught how to use Tenta Missiles in Judd's trials, the player is equipped with the REEF-LUX 450.",
    "REEF-LUX is a play on \"reflex bow\", \"reef\", and possibly \"acid reflux\" and \"deluxe\".",
    "\"450\" refers to the 45 damage the weapon deals per shot."
