    "The REEF-LUX 450 is a main weapon in Splatoon 3.",
    "The REEF-LUX 450 appears to be based on a knot assist, a tool used for fishing, and a compound bow. The bottle at the tip also shares similarities to a yakult bottle. The bottle changes color to match the player's ink.",
    "The REEF-LUX 450 was first shown in a Salmon Run gameplay video[1] before being officially announced or seen in-game. Compared to the Tri-Stringer, it is faster, lightweight, has a shorter range, has non-explosive shots and can hold a full charge for a short while in swim form.",
    "While the weapon image and data for the REEF-LUX 450 could not be found in the files for the Splatoon 3 Splatfest World Premiere, dataminers were able to locate Sheldon's description of the weapon, which also names the sub and special weapons in its kit. It was officially announced on 6 September 2022.[2]",
    "[3]",
    "The REEF-LUX 450 is a lighter version of the Tri-Stringer that's a bit more user-friendly for folks who are new to stringer-type weapons. Like most lightweight weapons, it doesn't pack the biggest punch or range—no exploding charged shots here—but it does offer the ability to store a charge! This set comes with Curling Bombs to help you close the gap into enemy turf quickly, letting you take full advantage of the nimble nature of your main weapon. And when you want to make a big impact in a hurry, don't forget about your Tenta Missiles. You can make it rain missiles on opponents out of range of the REEF-LUX. This is a highly mobile loadout that lets you fight with flexibility and still take down powerhouse opponents. I hope you give it a try!",
