The nozzles and the center tube's cap are also colored olive green instead of black.\n\nThe Inkline Tri-Stringer became available on 1 September 2023 at 00:00 UTC. It comes in a set with the Sprinkler and Super Chump.\n\n- The Inkline Tri-Stringer is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 25. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The Inkline Tri-Stringer fires 3 arrows per shot.\n\n- Ink consumption scales with charge level. It starts at 5% of the ink tank at no charge, 6% of the ink tank at one charge circle, and 8.5% of the ink tank at full charge.\n\n- The Inkline Tri-Stringer cannot store its charge.\n\n- If charged to the first circle or higher, the shots become explosive.\nThe shots explode after 45 frames (0.75 seconds), dealing 30 damage to players with a 2.0 unit radius.\n\n- The shots explode after 45 frames (0.75 seconds), dealing 30 damage to players with a 2.0 unit radius.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with players has a radius of 0.18 units.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with the environment has a radius of 0.2 units.\n\n- The weapon cannot fire until it has charged for 9 frames. The first circle is reached after charging for 30 frames (0.5 seconds), and full charge is reached after 72 frames (1.2 seconds).\n\n- After firing, there is a delay before another shot can be charged. This delay is 12 frames at no charge, 15 frames at one charge circle, and 15 frames at full charge.\n\n- The delay between firing a shot (charged or uncharged) and submerging in ink is 10 frames.\nWhen charging while out of ink, the amount of time it takes to charge is multiplied by 3. When charging in the air, the time it takes to charge is also multiplied by 3.\n\n- When charging while out of ink, the amount of time it takes to charge is multiplied by 3. When charging in the air, the time it takes to charge is also multiplied by 3.\n\n- The movement speed while charging is set to 0.068 units per frame.\n\n- The shots explode after 45 frames (0.75 seconds), dealing 30 damage to players with a 2.0 unit radius.\n\n- When charging while out of ink, the amount of time it takes to charge is multiplied by 3. When charging in the air, the time it takes to charge is also multiplied by 3.\n\n- After firing, there is a 20 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Initial shot velocity scales with charge level. It starts at 2.1 units per frame at no charge, 2.1 units per frame at one charge circle, and 3.85 at full charge.\nShots travel straight for 4 frames, regardless of charge level.\nThe effective range is 13.01 units at no charge, 13.01 units at one charge circle, and 23.7 units at full charge.\nThis number represents the range in which the crosshair changes shape when placed over an enemy. However, since stringer weapons do not have damage falloff, these numbers are otherwise arbitrary.\n\n- Shots travel straight for 4 frames, regardless of charge level.\n\n- The effective range is 13.01 units at no charge, 13.01 units at one charge circle, and 23.7 units at full charge.\nThis number represents the range in which the crosshair changes shape when placed over an enemy.

It starts at 30 damage at no charge, 35 damage at one charge circle, and 35 at full charge.\n\n- Arrow angle changes with charge level. It starts at 8.0 degrees at no charge, 8 degrees at one charge circle, and 0 degrees at full charge.\n\n- The arrows fire 0.4 units apart from each other.\n\n- Shots travel straight for 4 frames, regardless of charge level.\n\n- The effective range is 13.01 units at no charge, 13.01 units at one charge circle, and 23.7 units at full charge.\nThis number represents the range in which the crosshair changes shape when placed over an enemy.

With a new loadout and look, I hope Tri-Stringer fans will check it out! For those on the fence, I've got ideas about how to take advantage of this set's strengths. Try luring enemies with the Sprinkler—a fully charged Tri-Stringer shot will take 'em out! And you have the Super Chump decoy to help you take advantage of the main weapon's ultra-long range and firepower. I think this setup really lets the Inkline Tri-Stringer shine, so give it a fully charged shot!\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Inkline Tri-Stringer.\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Inkline_Tri-Stringer_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nModel of the Inkline Tri-Stringer rotating (Link to file)\n\nFor competitive tips about the Inkline Tri-Stringer\n\n- The Inkline Tri-Stringer is the second weapon with the Inkline branding, after the Tenta Sorella Brella.\n\n- Contrary to its final name, the Inkline Tri-Stringer was initially labeled as the 'Tri-Stringer Collab' on its Tableturf Battle card in the Drizzle Season 2023 trailer[3] (a naming convention sometimes used generically for collaborative weapon variants in other languages). Whether this naming was in error or simply a placeholder is unknown.\n\n- If weapons from Splatoon 2's Kensa Collection are excluded, the Inkline Tri-Stringer is the only weapon with gear branding to not be made by the Splat brand."
