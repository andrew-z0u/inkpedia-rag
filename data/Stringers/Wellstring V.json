It is a stringer which fires five exploding projectiles, with its reticles converging on the first charge and diverging again on the second charge to shoot in a wide area.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Splatoon 3\n\n2.1 Data\n2.2 Version history\n2.3 Quotes\n2.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n2.5 Gallery\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 2.5 Gallery\n\n- 3 Trivia\n\n- 4 Etymology\n\n4.1 Names in other languages\n4.2 Translation notes\n\n- 4.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 4.2 Translation notes\n\n- 5 References\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 2.5 Gallery\n\n- 4.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 4.2 Translation notes\n\nThe Wellstring V is based on an antique green cast-iron well pump, and its arms are based on the corresponding pump-lever. Two steel rods protrude from the top and bottom of the weapon, connected to the arms, and protrude further when armed. The pull tab at the rear of the weapon has a groove for a rope, although it does not have one. It has a light-blue grip, and a Custom logo embossed on its underside.\n\nThe Wellstring V made its debut on Splatoon 3, after being revealed in the Sizzle Season 2024 trailer on 16 May 2024 and was released on 1 June 2024. Its kit consists of Autobomb and Ultra Stamp.\n\nWhen fired with a tap of , the Wellstring V fires five ink projectiles, each dealing 24 damage (x5 = 120 maximum). The five shots are scattered, inking a large surface. The weapon fires horizontally, but can fire vertically if the player is in the air.\n\nLike other stringers, the Wellstring V can be charged: holding  charges a first gauge, then a second.\n\nAt the end of the first gauge, the five aiming reticles converge, creating near-perfect accuracy, and the weapon will shoot five projectiles resembling frozen popsicles which will explode after a few frames, each dealing 30 damage (x5 = 150 maximum). The direct hit damage remains the same than when fired with a tap of .\n\nAlong the second gauge, the five projectiles will diverge, and projectile direct hit damage will increase, reaching a maximum of 35 (x5 = 175 maximum). However, the damage caused by the explosion remains unchanged.\n\nThroughout the charge (during the first and second gauges), the range of the shots increases. Fully loaded with the aiming reticles spread out, firing the weapon vertically can slightly increase range.\n\n- The Wellstring V is a heavyweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 23. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The Wellstring V fires 5 arrows per shot.\n\n- Ink consumption scales with charge level. It starts at 7% of the ink tank at no charge, 8% of the ink tank at one charge circle, and 9% of the ink tank at full charge.\n\n- The Wellstring V cannot store its charge.\n\n- If charged to the first circle or higher, the shots become explosive.\nThe shots explode after 45 frames (0.75 seconds), dealing 30 damage to players with a 2.0 unit radius.\n\n- The shots explode after 45 frames (0.75 seconds), dealing 30 damage to players with a 2.0 unit radius.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with players has a radius of 0.18 units.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with the environment has a radius of 0.2 units.\n\n- The weapon cannot fire until it has charged for 12 frames. The first circle is reached after charging for 40 frames (0.67 seconds), and full charge is reached after 80 frames (1.33 seconds).\n\n- After firing, there is a delay before another shot can be charged. This delay is 12 frames at no charge, 15 frames at one charge circle, and 15 frames at full charge.\n\n- The delay between firing a shot (charged or uncharged) and submerging in ink is 10 frames.\nWhen charging while out of ink, the amount of time it takes to charge is multiplied by 3. When charging in the air, the time it takes to charge is also multiplied by 3.\n\n- When charging while out of ink, the amount of time it takes to charge is multiplied by 3. When charging in the air, the time it takes to charge is also multiplied by 3.\n\n- The movement speed while charging is set to 0.04 units per frame.\n\n- The shots explode after 45 frames (0.75 seconds), dealing 30 damage to players with a 2.0 unit radius.\n\n- When charging while out of ink, the amount of time it takes to charge is multiplied by 3. When charging in the air, the time it takes to charge is also multiplied by 3.\n\n- After firing, there is a 20 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Initial shot velocity scales with charge level. It starts at 1.45 units per frame at no charge, 2.294 units per frame at one charge circle, and 3.5 at full charge.\nShots travel straight for 4 frames, regardless of charge level.\nThe effective range is 9.04 units at no charge, 14.2 units at one charge circle, and 21.57 units at full charge.\nThis number represents the range in which the crosshair changes shape when placed over an enemy. However, since stringer weapons do not have damage falloff, these numbers are otherwise arbitrary.\n\n- Shots travel straight for 4 frames, regardless of charge level.\n\n- The effective range is 9.04 units at no charge, 14.2 units at one charge circle, and 21.57 units at full charge.\nThis number represents the range in which the crosshair changes shape when placed over an enemy.

It starts at 24 damage at no charge, 24 damage at one charge circle, and 35 at full charge.\n\n- Arrow angle changes with charge level. It starts at 12.0 degrees at no charge, -4 degrees at one charge circle, and -12.0 degrees at full charge.\n\n- The arrows fire 0.2 units apart from each other.\n\n- Shots travel straight for 4 frames, regardless of charge level.\n\n- The effective range is 9.04 units at no charge, 14.2 units at one charge circle, and 21.57 units at full charge.\nThis number represents the range in which the crosshair changes shape when placed over an enemy.

There's no better stringer to apply pressure than this baby. Charged to a certain point, all five shots will go to the same target. A direct hit like that will give your enemy something to cry about! But if you keep charging past that, the ink explosives spread over an even wider area! Covering the entire front line at once is a snap! And the Autobomb sub weapon leaves foes with nowhere to hide. Once they break cover, they're a prime target for your arrows! All of this is meant to happen from the back lines, of course. But if things get really dire, you have the Ultra Stamp to go on the attack! It's a special weapon that wants someone capable of throwing a wrench into enemy plans by mastering the different charge levels. Are YOU that someone?\n\n- The Wellstring V in the Sizzle Season 2024 trailer.\n\n- Promotional render\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- Tableturf Battle artwork\n\n- Artwork of an Inkling holding the Wellstring V.\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Wellstring_V_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nModel of the Wellstring V rotating (link to file)\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Wellstring_V_demonstration.mp4\n\n\nWeapon demonstration video (link to file)\n\n- The Wellstring V is the only stringer capable of splatting an opponent with one shot at no charge.\n\n- The Wellstring V is the only stringer whose firing range increases while both gauges are charging, not just one of them.\n\n- When all shots from one charge of the weapon hit a single opponent, and they deal over 100.0 damage total, a special hit sound effect plays, accompanied by a visible flash.\nThis effect is shared with the H-3 Nozzlenose, Tri-Stringer, and REEF-LUX 450 families.\nThis effect does not occur in Salmon Run Next Wave.\n\n- This effect is shared with the H-3 Nozzlenose, Tri-Stringer, and REEF-LUX 450 families.\n\n- This effect does not occur in Salmon Run Next Wave.\n\n- The Wellstring V and The Mint Decavitator are the only two weapons in the Splatoon series where both the new weapon and their second kit got released in the same update.\n\n- This effect is shared with the H-3 Nozzlenose, Tri-Stringer, and REEF-LUX 450 families.\n\n- This effect does not occur in Salmon Run Next Wave.\n\nWellstring is a pun on the word \"wellspring\", a water source - referencing the weapon being made from a water pump, and \"string\", referencing this weapon being a stringer-type weapon. V is the Roman numeral five, referencing the number of projectiles launched by this weapon, and is pronounced as the English \"five\".[3]"
