    "The Wellstring V is a main weapon in Splatoon 3, made by Custom. It is a stringer which fires five exploding projectiles, with its reticles converging on the first charge and diverging again on the second charge to shoot in a wide area.",
    "The Wellstring V is based on an antique green cast-iron well pump, and its arms are based on the corresponding pump-lever. Two steel rods protrude from the top and bottom of the weapon, connected to the arms, and protrude further when armed. The pull tab at the rear of the weapon has a groove for a rope, although it does not have one. It has a light-blue grip, and a Custom logo embossed on its underside.",
    "The Wellstring V made its debut on Splatoon 3, after being revealed in the Sizzle Season 2024 trailer on 16 May 2024 and was released on 1 June 2024. Its kit consists of Autobomb and Ultra Stamp.",
    "When fired with a tap of , the Wellstring V fires five ink projectiles, each dealing 24 damage (x5 = 120 maximum). The five shots are scattered, inking a large surface. The weapon fires horizontally, but can fire vertically if the player is in the air.",
    "Like other stringers, the Wellstring V can be charged: holding  charges a first gauge, then a second.",
    "At the end of the first gauge, the five aiming reticles converge, creating near-perfect accuracy, and the weapon will shoot five projectiles resembling frozen popsicles which will explode after a few frames, each dealing 30 damage (x5 = 150 maximum). The direct hit damage remains the same than when fired with a tap of .",
    "Along the second gauge, the five projectiles will diverge, and projectile direct hit damage will increase, reaching a maximum of 35 (x5 = 175 maximum). However, the damage caused by the explosion remains unchanged.",
    "Throughout the charge (during the first and second gauges), the range of the shots increases. Fully loaded with the aiming reticles spread out, firing the weapon vertically can slightly increase range.",
    "[1][2]",
    "The Wellstring V is named for its wide shot spread—it can send ink in five directions at once! There's no better stringer to apply pressure than this baby. Charged to a certain point, all five shots will go to the same target. A direct hit like that will give your enemy something to cry about! But if you keep charging past that, the ink explosives spread over an even wider area! Covering the entire front line at once is a snap! And the Autobomb sub weapon leaves foes with nowhere to hide. Once they break cover, they're a prime target for your arrows! All of this is meant to happen from the back lines, of course. But if things get really dire, you have the Ultra Stamp to go on the attack! It's a special weapon that wants someone capable of throwing a wrench into enemy plans by mastering the different charge levels. Are YOU that someone?",
    "Wellstring is a pun on the word \"wellspring\", a water source - referencing the weapon being made from a water pump, and \"string\", referencing this weapon being a stringer-type weapon. V is the Roman numeral five, referencing the number of projectiles launched by this weapon, and is pronounced as the English \"five\".[3]",
