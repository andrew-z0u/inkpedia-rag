The central black part is changed to white, and its plastic is now slightly translucent, which makes the color of the ink-colored bottle inside visible from certain angles. The strings are orange instead of white. Additionally, a squid-shaped carabiner is attached to the top of the weapon.\n\nThe REEF-LUX 450 MIL-K makes its first appearance in Splatoon 3 with identical stats to the REEF-LUX 450.\n\n- The REEF-LUX 450 MIL-K is a lightweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 15. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The REEF-LUX 450 MIL-K fires 3 arrows per shot.\n\n- Ink consumption scales with charge level. It starts at 3.5% of the ink tank at no charge, 4.68% of the ink tank at one charge circle, and 6.5% of the ink tank at full charge.\n\n- The REEF-LUX 450 MIL-K can store its charge while submerged in ink.\nA stored charge can be held for up to 75 frames (1.25 seconds). The animation of coming out of a stored charge lasts for 21 frames, and a shot can be fired 27 frames after coming out of ink.\n\n- A stored charge can be held for up to 75 frames (1.25 seconds). The animation of coming out of a stored charge lasts for 21 frames, and a shot can be fired 27 frames after coming out of ink.\n\n- Shots fired by the REEF-LUX 450 MIL-K do not explode.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with players has a radius of 0.18 units.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with the environment has a radius of 0.2 units.\n\n- The weapon cannot fire until it has charged for 6 frames. The first circle is reached after charging for 12 frames (0.2 seconds), and full charge is reached after 34 frames (0.57 seconds).\n\n- After firing, there is a delay before another shot can be charged. This delay is 8 frames at no charge, 15 frames at one charge circle, and 15 frames at full charge.\n\n- The delay between firing a shot (charged or uncharged) and submerging in ink is 10 frames.\nWhen charging while out of ink, the amount of time it takes to charge is multiplied by 3. The charge speed while airborne is the same as the charge speed on the ground.\n\n- When charging while out of ink, the amount of time it takes to charge is multiplied by 3. The charge speed while airborne is the same as the charge speed on the ground.\n\n- The movement speed while charging is set to 0.084 units per frame.\n\n- A stored charge can be held for up to 75 frames (1.25 seconds). The animation of coming out of a stored charge lasts for 21 frames, and a shot can be fired 27 frames after coming out of ink.\n\n- When charging while out of ink, the amount of time it takes to charge is multiplied by 3. The charge speed while airborne is the same as the charge speed on the ground.\n\n- After firing, there is a 20 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Initial shot velocity scales with charge level. It starts at 1.45 units per frame at no charge, 1.45 units per frame at one charge circle, and 2.55 at full charge.\nShots travel straight for 4 frames, regardless of charge level.\nThe effective range is 8.56 units at no charge, 8.56 units at one charge circle, and 14.91 units at full charge.\nThis number represents the range in which the crosshair changes shape when placed over an enemy. However, since stringer weapons do not have damage falloff, these numbers are otherwise arbitrary.\n\n- Shots travel straight for 4 frames, regardless of charge level.\n\n- The effective range is 8.56 units at no charge, 8.56 units at one charge circle, and 14.91 units at full charge.\nThis number represents the range in which the crosshair changes shape when placed over an enemy.

It starts at 30 damage at no charge, 45 damage at one charge circle, and 45 at full charge.\n\n- Arrow angle changes with charge level. It starts at 10.5 degrees at no charge, 5 degrees at one charge circle, and 0.5 degrees at full charge.\n\n- The arrows fire 0.2 units apart from each other.\n\n- Shots travel straight for 4 frames, regardless of charge level.\n\n- The effective range is 8.56 units at no charge, 8.56 units at one charge circle, and 14.91 units at full charge.\nThis number represents the range in which the crosshair changes shape when placed over an enemy.

Paired now with the Torpedo sub, this set is excellent for sniffing out opponent locations and then sopping them up with a charged shot from your main. And if you find yourself in a pinch? You've got Booyah Bombs chilling in the fridge. This set can turn anyone lactose intolerant and will have your enemies raising the white flag!\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- Promotional image of the Splatlands Collection - Barazushi weapons\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_REEF-LUX_450_MIL-K_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nPromotional video (link to file)\n\nThe suffix \"MIL-K\" is a stylized spelling of the word milk."
