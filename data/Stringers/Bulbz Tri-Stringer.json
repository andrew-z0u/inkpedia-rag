    "Good things come in threes, right? They must, because the Bulbz Tri-Stringer shoots three blasts of ink and comes decorated in three bright neon colours, courtesy of Emberz. Paired with the Angle Shooter sub, this set allows you to mark your opponents and nail 'em with a charged shot. And if they escape? The Inkjet is your blueprint to victory. I can strongly recommend this set for anyone whose spirit burns bright and who feels a tad superstitious about the number three.",
