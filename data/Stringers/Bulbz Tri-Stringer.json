The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The Bulbz Tri-Stringer fires 3 arrows per shot.\n\n- Ink consumption scales with charge level. It starts at 5% of the ink tank at no charge, 6% of the ink tank at one charge circle, and 8.5% of the ink tank at full charge.\n\n- The Bulbz Tri-Stringer cannot store its charge.\n\n- If charged to the first circle or higher, the shots become explosive.\nThe shots explode after 45 frames (0.75 seconds), dealing 30 damage to players with a 2.0 unit radius.\n\n- The shots explode after 45 frames (0.75 seconds), dealing 30 damage to players with a 2.0 unit radius.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with players has a radius of 0.18 units.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with the environment has a radius of 0.2 units.\n\n- The weapon cannot fire until it has charged for 9 frames. The first circle is reached after charging for 30 frames (0.5 seconds), and full charge is reached after 72 frames (1.2 seconds).\n\n- After firing, there is a delay before another shot can be charged. This delay is 12 frames at no charge, 15 frames at one charge circle, and 15 frames at full charge.\n\n- The delay between firing a shot (charged or uncharged) and submerging in ink is 10 frames.\nWhen charging while out of ink, the amount of time it takes to charge is multiplied by 3. When charging in the air, the time it takes to charge is also multiplied by 3.\n\n- When charging while out of ink, the amount of time it takes to charge is multiplied by 3. When charging in the air, the time it takes to charge is also multiplied by 3.\n\n- The movement speed while charging is set to 0.068 units per frame.\n\n- The shots explode after 45 frames (0.75 seconds), dealing 30 damage to players with a 2.0 unit radius.\n\n- When charging while out of ink, the amount of time it takes to charge is multiplied by 3. When charging in the air, the time it takes to charge is also multiplied by 3.\n\n- After firing, there is a 20 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Initial shot velocity scales with charge level. It starts at 2.1 units per frame at no charge, 2.1 units per frame at one charge circle, and 3.85 at full charge.\nShots travel straight for 4 frames, regardless of charge level.\nThe effective range is 13.01 units at no charge, 13.01 units at one charge circle, and 23.7 units at full charge.\nThis number represents the range in which the crosshair changes shape when placed over an enemy. However, since stringer weapons do not have damage falloff, these numbers are otherwise arbitrary.\n\n- Shots travel straight for 4 frames, regardless of charge level.\n\n- The effective range is 13.01 units at no charge, 13.01 units at one charge circle, and 23.7 units at full charge.\nThis number represents the range in which the crosshair changes shape when placed over an enemy.

It starts at 30 damage at no charge, 35 damage at one charge circle, and 35 at full charge.\n\n- Arrow angle changes with charge level. It starts at 8.0 degrees at no charge, 8 degrees at one charge circle, and 0 degrees at full charge.\n\n- The arrows fire 0.4 units apart from each other.\n\n- Shots travel straight for 4 frames, regardless of charge level.\n\n- The effective range is 13.01 units at no charge, 13.01 units at one charge circle, and 23.7 units at full charge.\nThis number represents the range in which the crosshair changes shape when placed over an enemy.

They must, because the Bulbz Tri-Stringer shoots three blasts of ink and comes decorated in three bright neon colours, courtesy of Emberz. Paired with the Angle Shooter sub, this set allows you to mark your opponents and nail 'em with a charged shot. And if they escape? The Inkjet is your blueprint to victory. I can strongly recommend this set for anyone whose spirit burns bright and who feels a tad superstitious about the number three.\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- Promotional artwork for Land vs. Sea vs. Air\n\n- Promotional image for Version 10.0.0\n\nThe word bulbz is a stylized spelling of the word bulbs."
