It starts at 3.5% of the ink tank at no charge, 4.68% of the ink tank at one charge circle, and 6.5% of the ink tank at full charge.\n\n- The REEF-LUX 450 Deco can store its charge while submerged in ink.\nA stored charge can be held for up to 75 frames (1.25 seconds). The animation of coming out of a stored charge lasts for 21 frames, and a shot can be fired 27 frames after coming out of ink.\n\n- A stored charge can be held for up to 75 frames (1.25 seconds).

The first circle is reached after charging for 12 frames (0.2 seconds), and full charge is reached after 34 frames (0.57 seconds).\n\n- After firing, there is a delay before another shot can be charged. This delay is 8 frames at no charge, 15 frames at one charge circle, and 15 frames at full charge.\n\n- The delay between firing a shot (charged or uncharged) and submerging in ink is 10 frames.\nWhen charging while out of ink, the amount of time it takes to charge is multiplied by 3. The charge speed while airborne is the same as the charge speed on the ground.\n\n- When charging while out of ink, the amount of time it takes to charge is multiplied by 3. The charge speed while airborne is the same as the charge speed on the ground.\n\n- The movement speed while charging is set to 0.084 units per frame.\n\n- A stored charge can be held for up to 75 frames (1.25 seconds).

However, since stringer weapons do not have damage falloff, these numbers are otherwise arbitrary.\n\n- Shots travel straight for 4 frames, regardless of charge level.\n\n- The effective range is 8.56 units at no charge, 8.56 units at one charge circle, and 14.91 units at full charge.\nThis number represents the range in which the crosshair changes shape when placed over an enemy.

But with a fresh loadout, it offers new possibilities. For instance, you can now stake out a safe area with the Splash Wall sub, allowing you a window of opportunity to snipe far-off foes with fully charged shots. And when that special gauge is full, don't hesitate to twist the wrist and fire off a Reefslider special. It's a great way to help push the front line forward for your team. I recommend this set for folks who simply love inking turf but also want the option to boldly venture behind enemy lines when the moment is right.\n\n- Promotional render\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the REEF-LUX 450 Deco.\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_REEF-LUX_450_Deco_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nModel of the REEF-LUX 450 Deco rotating (link to file)"
