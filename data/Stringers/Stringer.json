They possess increased range when charged with , while also increasing damage (with the potential for a one-hit splat) like chargers, but they also possess two levels of charge akin to splatlings.\n\nWhen charging, range increases proportionally to the amount of charge, allowing the stringer user to more finely control where their arcing shots may land. However, damage is usually immediately increased by a flat amount when the first charging circle is filled, meaning stringers are not as beholden as chargers to a full charge for maximum lethality.\n\nStringers fire in a horizontal spread when grounded, but a user may additionally choose to fire vertically at any time by jumping with  (or any other means of entering a midair state). Depending on charge level, this may narrow the horizontal spread of ink considerably, but can also increase lethality when targeting enemies.\n\nNote: The series are arranged by their respective order in the weapon select screen with the Main filter.\n\nThe following stringer(s) are only available outside of battles as part of other modes:\n\nSpawner pose:\n\n- All styles: Stands in a crouched pose with their weapon angled down and their right hand readied.\n\nVictory:\n\n- Flip Out: Jumping into the air while shooting the weapon downwards twice, then lands kneeling and pulls its string back while aiming into the distance.\n\n- Reppin' Inkopolis: Twirls the weapon around before pulling the string back and aiming into the distance while standing. (Added in version 7.0.0. Versions prior used the same animation as Flip Out.)\n\n- The Square Show-Off: Throws the weapon in the air, spins with it after catching it, and pulling the string back while kneeling with their back turned the camera.\n\n- An Inkling doing the Flip Out emote with the Tri-Stringer after winning a battle.\n\n- Art of the stringer weapon class icon in Splatoon 3.\n\n- An Inkling holding the Tri-Stringer\n\n- An Inkling shooting a Tri-Stringer.\n\n- An Inkling aiming a Tri-Stringer.\n\n- The Tri-Stringer charging its shot.\n\n- The Inkling furthest to the left is holding the Tri-Stringer.\n\n- Key art with the Tri-Stringer\n\n- Render of an Inkling with the Tri-Stringer\n\n- An Octoling using the Tri-Stringer\n\n- The Tri-Stringer is held by the Inkling on the right\n\n- The Tri-Stringer on the left, representing team Wisdom in the Power vs. Wisdom vs. Courage Splatfest.\n\n- The Wellstring V in the Sizzle Season 2024 trailer.\n\n- Tri-Stringer\n\n- Inkline Tri-Stringer\n\n- Order Stringer Replica\n\n- REEF-LUX 450\n\n- REEF-LUX 450 Deco\n\n- Wellstring V\n\n- Custom Wellstring V\n\n- Tri-Stringer\n\n- Inkline Tri-Stringer\n\n- Bulbz Tri-Stringer\n\n- Order Stringer Replica\n\n- Grizzco Stringer\n\n- REEF-LUX 450\n\n- REEF-LUX 450 Deco\n\n- REEF-LUX 450 MIL-K\n\n- Wellstring V\n\n- Custom Wellstring V\n\n- Tri-Stringer\n\n- Inkline Tri-Stringer\n\n- REEF-LUX 450\n\n- REEF-LUX 450 Deco\n\n- Wellstring V\n\n- Custom Wellstring V\n\n- Tri-Stringer\n\n- Inkline Tri-Stringer\n\n- REEF-LUX 450\n\n- REEF-LUX 450 Deco\n\n- Wellstring V\n\n- Custom Wellstring V\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Gameplay_Clip_Switch_OLED_Announcement_Trailer.mp4\n\n\nEarly footage of the Tri-Stringer being used in Splatoon 3 gameplay.

The only other main weapons to have this trait are the Bloblobber, Explosher, and Tenta Brella families.\n\n- The internal ordering of stringer weapon IDs is different from all other weapon classes.\nFollowing the first one or two digits, which identify a weapon's class, all other weapon classes have a weapon internally listed as being the \"0\"th main weapon of that type. It is then followed by another number to indicate which kit loadout of the weapon it is. Curiously, the stringer class skips the expected value 7000 and begins with the Tri-Stringer as weapon ID 7010, which would usually be reserved for the second weapon in the class.\n\n- Following the first one or two digits, which identify a weapon's class, all other weapon classes have a weapon internally listed as being the \"0\"th main weapon of that type.
