    "The Custom Wellstring V made its debut along with the Wellstring V in Sizzle Season 2024. They were revealed together on Nintendo social networks on 17 May 2024. Its set is Point Sensor and Wave Breaker. The design is different from the Wellstring V in that the logo on the front side's colors now match the original Custom logo, and the color of the handle has been changed from a pale blue to gray.",

    "This Custom Wellstring V uses, well, custom parts to pump new life into the Wellstring V! At bottom, it's just like the Wellstring V, but it's built more for team support. The Point Sensor and Wave Breaker are there to reveal your enemy's position. Once you have that, use your main weapon to block their retreat so your team can go all out! This weapon is looking for a good home with someone thoughtful, considerate, and eager to help create opportunities for their teammates.",
