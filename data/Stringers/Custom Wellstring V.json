The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The Custom Wellstring V fires 5 arrows per shot.\n\n- Ink consumption scales with charge level. It starts at 7% of the ink tank at no charge, 8% of the ink tank at one charge circle, and 9% of the ink tank at full charge.\n\n- The Custom Wellstring V cannot store its charge.\n\n- If charged to the first circle or higher, the shots become explosive.\nThe shots explode after 45 frames (0.75 seconds), dealing 30 damage to players with a 2.0 unit radius.\n\n- The shots explode after 45 frames (0.75 seconds), dealing 30 damage to players with a 2.0 unit radius.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with players has a radius of 0.18 units.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with the environment has a radius of 0.2 units.\n\n- The weapon cannot fire until it has charged for 12 frames. The first circle is reached after charging for 40 frames (0.67 seconds), and full charge is reached after 80 frames (1.33 seconds).\n\n- After firing, there is a delay before another shot can be charged. This delay is 12 frames at no charge, 15 frames at one charge circle, and 15 frames at full charge.\n\n- The delay between firing a shot (charged or uncharged) and submerging in ink is 10 frames.\nWhen charging while out of ink, the amount of time it takes to charge is multiplied by 3. When charging in the air, the time it takes to charge is also multiplied by 3.\n\n- When charging while out of ink, the amount of time it takes to charge is multiplied by 3. When charging in the air, the time it takes to charge is also multiplied by 3.\n\n- The movement speed while charging is set to 0.04 units per frame.\n\n- The shots explode after 45 frames (0.75 seconds), dealing 30 damage to players with a 2.0 unit radius.\n\n- When charging while out of ink, the amount of time it takes to charge is multiplied by 3.

It starts at 1.45 units per frame at no charge, 2.294 units per frame at one charge circle, and 3.5 at full charge.\nShots travel straight for 4 frames, regardless of charge level.\nThe effective range is 9.04 units at no charge, 14.2 units at one charge circle, and 21.57 units at full charge.\nThis number represents the range in which the crosshair changes shape when placed over an enemy. However, since stringer weapons do not have damage falloff, these numbers are otherwise arbitrary.\n\n- Shots travel straight for 4 frames, regardless of charge level.\n\n- The effective range is 9.04 units at no charge, 14.2 units at one charge circle, and 21.57 units at full charge.\nThis number represents the range in which the crosshair changes shape when placed over an enemy.

At bottom, it's just like the Wellstring V, but it's built more for team support. The Point Sensor and Wave Breaker are there to reveal your enemy's position. Once you have that, use your main weapon to block their retreat so your team can go all out! This weapon is looking for a good home with someone thoughtful, considerate, and eager to help create opportunities for their teammates.\n\n- Promotional render\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- Tableturf Battle artwork\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Custom_Wellstring_V_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nModel of the Custom Wellstring V rotating (link to file)\n\n- The Custom Wellstring V and the Wellstring V are the only stringers capable of splatting an opponent with one shot at no charge."
