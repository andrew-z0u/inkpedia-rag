    "The Custom Wellstring V is a main weapon in Splatoon 3, made by Custom. It is the Custom branded version of the Wellstring V.",
    "The only distinctions from the Wellstring V are a full-colour Custom logo on the underside of the weapon, overlaid on top of the usual engraved logo, and its grip is black instead of light blue.",
    "The Custom Wellstring V made its debut along with the Wellstring V in Sizzle Season 2024. They were revealed together on Nintendo social networks on 17 May 2024. Its set is Point Sensor and Wave Breaker. The design is different from the Wellstring V in that the logo on the front side's colors now match the original Custom logo, and the color of the handle has been changed from a pale blue to gray.",
