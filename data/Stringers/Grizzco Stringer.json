Compared to the Tri-Stringer, it has a slightly faster charge time and significantly higher damage, but also has a much faster rate of ink consumption and is difficult to aim. It is optimal when fighting against King Salmonids to use the Grizzco Stringer, as their large sizes allow the Grizzco Stringer to more easily hit all of its shots, dealing major damage quickly.\n\nThe Grizzco Stringer is a modified version of the Tri-Stringer, though unlike the other Grizzco weapons it does not feature any stripped metal parts, instead having a set of metal armatures on either side of the main ink plunger, both carrying four mismatched markers that function as extra barrels. These barrels are wrapped in metal and have mostly black tips, with the exception of two with metallic tips, and behind each tip is a glowing orange ring around its circumference. In addition, the fishing reel on the side of the bow has an added component resembling a yellow pill bottle with a white cover. Unlike other Grizzco weapons, the Grizzco Stringer does not feature the company's logo sticker anywhere in the body of the weapon.\n\nThe Grizzco Stringer is one of the rare weapons in Salmon Run Next Wave. It was first available on 1 October 2022 at 16:00 UTC.[2]\n\n- The Grizzco Stringer is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The Grizzco Stringer fires 9 arrows per shot.\n\n- Ink consumption scales with charge level. It starts at 9% of the ink tank at no charge, 12% of the ink tank at one charge circle, and 24% of the ink tank at full charge.\n\n- The Grizzco Stringer cannot store its charge.\n\n- If charged to the first circle or higher, the shots become explosive.\nThe shots explode after 45 frames (0.75 seconds), dealing 40 damage to players with a 2.0 unit radius.\n\n- The shots explode after 45 frames (0.75 seconds), dealing 40 damage to players with a 2.0 unit radius.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with players has a radius of 0.18 units.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with the environment has a radius of 0.2 units.\n\n- The weapon cannot fire until it has charged for 10 frames. The first circle is reached after charging for 30 frames (0.5 seconds), and full charge is reached after 62 frames (1.03 seconds).\n\n- After firing, there is a delay before another shot can be charged. This delay is 12 frames at no charge, 15 frames at one charge circle, and 15 frames at full charge.\n\n- The delay between firing a shot (charged or uncharged) and submerging in ink is 10 frames.\nWhen charging while out of ink, the amount of time it takes to charge is multiplied by 3. When charging in the air, the time it takes to charge is also multiplied by 3.\n\n- When charging while out of ink, the amount of time it takes to charge is multiplied by 3. When charging in the air, the time it takes to charge is also multiplied by 3.\n\n- The movement speed while charging is set to 0.068 units per frame.\n\n- The shots explode after 45 frames (0.75 seconds), dealing 40 damage to players with a 2.0 unit radius.\n\n- When charging while out of ink, the amount of time it takes to charge is multiplied by 3. When charging in the air, the time it takes to charge is also multiplied by 3.\n\n- After firing, there is a 20 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Initial shot velocity scales with charge level and varies between arrows. It starts at 1.8 to 2.4 units per frame at no charge, 1.8 to 2.4 units per frame at one charge circle, and 3.7 to 4.5 at full charge.\nShots travel straight for 4 frames, regardless of charge level.\nThe effective range is 11.18 to 14.84 units at no charge, 11.18 to 14.84 units at one charge circle, and 22.79 to 27.68 units at full charge.\nThis number represents the range in which the crosshair changes shape when placed over an enemy. However, since stringer weapons do not have damage falloff, these numbers are otherwise arbitrary.\n\n- Shots travel straight for 4 frames, regardless of charge level.\n\n- The effective range is 11.18 to 14.84 units at no charge, 11.18 to 14.84 units at one charge circle, and 22.79 to 27.68 units at full charge.\nThis number represents the range in which the crosshair changes shape when placed over an enemy.

However, since stringer weapons do not have damage falloff, these numbers are otherwise arbitrary.\n\n- Damage scales with charge level. It starts at 35 damage at no charge, 72 damage at one charge circle, and 150 at full charge.\n\n- Arrow angle changes with charge level. It starts at 33 degrees at no charge, 33 degrees at one charge circle, and 21 degrees at full charge.\n\n- The arrows fire 0.2 units apart from each other.\n\n- Shots travel straight for 4 frames, regardless of charge level.\n\n- The effective range is 11.18 to 14.84 units at no charge, 11.18 to 14.84 units at one charge circle, and 22.79 to 27.68 units at full charge.\nThis number represents the range in which the crosshair changes shape when placed over an enemy.

However, since stringer weapons do not have damage falloff, these numbers are otherwise arbitrary.\n\n[3]\n\n- ▲ The size of terrain area inked by falling spray has been increased.\n\n- ▲ The number of spray droplets generated when firing a distantly aimed shot has been increased.\nMaximum amount of spray droplets per projectile: 3 → 5.\n\n- Maximum amount of spray droplets per projectile: 3 → 5.\n\n- Maximum amount of spray droplets per projectile: 3 → 5.\n\n- ▲ Increased movement speed while charging and while fully charged by approximately 13%: 0.06 → 0.068.\n\n- ▲ The area of terrain inked by falling spray has been increased.\n\n- ▲ Adjusted the positioning of falling ink spray.\nAmount of droplet patterns: 7 → 5.\n\n- Amount of droplet patterns: 7 → 5.\n\n- Amount of droplet patterns: 7 → 5.\n\nIn Splatoon 3, the Grizzco Stringer was available during the following wildcard rotations:\n\n- The nine crosshairs, shown in a constellation-like manner.\n\n- Icons for Inklings and Octolings\n\n- The Grizzco Stringer being held during a shift.\n\n- An Octoling holding the Grizzco Stringer\n\n- Held by a player\n\n- In the middle of being fired\n\n- Message for when a player is loaned the Grizzco Stringer\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- Among all the main weapons in the Splatoon series, the Grizzco Stringer has one of the most powerful single attacks, reaching a total of 1350 damage when landing all projectiles from a full charge.\n\n- Because of its irregular spread of arrows over a wide area, focusing its shots at a distance is difficult. However, the weapon has a cluster of two arrows relatively close to each other on the right of the central crosshair. Once charged, this group can deal 300 damage, effective against Steelheads.\n\n- Most balance changes that the Tri-Stringer got throughout updates also affected the Grizzco Stringer."
