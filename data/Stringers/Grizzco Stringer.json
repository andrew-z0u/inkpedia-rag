    "The Grizzco Stringer is a Salmon Run Next Wave rare weapon in Splatoon 3. It appears to be an illegitimately modified[1] Tri-Stringer.",
    "The Grizzco Stringer fires 9 arrows per shot with a wide and irregular spread. Compared to the Tri-Stringer, it has a slightly faster charge time and significantly higher damage, but also has a much faster rate of ink consumption and is difficult to aim. It is optimal when fighting against King Salmonids to use the Grizzco Stringer, as their large sizes allow the Grizzco Stringer to more easily hit all of its shots, dealing major damage quickly.",
    "The Grizzco Stringer is a modified version of the Tri-Stringer, though unlike the other Grizzco weapons it does not feature any stripped metal parts, instead having a set of metal armatures on either side of the main ink plunger, both carrying four mismatched markers that function as extra barrels. These barrels are wrapped in metal and have mostly black tips, with the exception of two with metallic tips, and behind each tip is a glowing orange ring around its circumference. In addition, the fishing reel on the side of the bow has an added component resembling a yellow pill bottle with a white cover. Unlike other Grizzco weapons, the Grizzco Stringer does not feature the company's logo sticker anywhere in the body of the weapon.",
    "The Grizzco Stringer is one of the rare weapons in Salmon Run Next Wave. It was first available on 1 October 2022 at 16:00 UTC.[2]",

    "- The nine crosshairs, shown in a constellation-like manner.",
    "- Icons for Inklings and Octolings",

    "- An Octoling holding the Grizzco Stringer",
    "- Held by a player",
    "- In the middle of being fired",
    "- Message for when a player is loaned the Grizzco Stringer",
    "- 2D icon",
    "- Among all the main weapons in the Splatoon series, the Grizzco Stringer has one of the most powerful single attacks, reaching a total of 1350 damage when landing all projectiles from a full charge.",
    "- Because of its irregular spread of arrows over a wide area, focusing its shots at a distance is difficult. However, the weapon has a cluster of two arrows relatively close to each other on the right of the central crosshair. Once charged, this group can deal 300 damage, effective against Steelheads.",
    "- Most balance changes that the Tri-Stringer got throughout updates also affected the Grizzco Stringer."
