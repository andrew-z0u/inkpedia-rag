  "content": "The Order Stringer is a stringer in Splatoon 3 that is exclusively used in Side Order.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Description\n\n- 3 Gallery\n\n- 4 Names in other languages\n\nThe Order Stringer has a minimalist appearance, with a single white molded piece for the bow and tubes of the weapon, as well as a metallic silver ink tank pump, reel, and nozzle. Its appearance is similar to that of a Tri-Stringer. When firing, ring-shaped holograms manifest around the nozzle.\n\nThe Order Stringer is a weapon unlocked in Side Order, and is part of Shiver's Palette. Its base set consists of Toxic Mist and Killer Wail 5.1, notably identical to that of the Tri-Stringer. However, this can be changed in the Spire of Order by using a vending machine.\n\nIt has lower stats in comparison to the Tri-Stringer, with a slower fire rate, explosion damage, strafe speed, ink efficiency, range, charge time, and is unable to store its charge, but has higher projectile damage. However, this can be upgraded through color chips in the Spire of Order.\n\n- The clear screen for the Order Stringer\n\n- The fail screen for the Order Stringer"
