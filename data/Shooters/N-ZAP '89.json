    "The N-ZAP '89 is a main weapon in the Splatoon series. It is a N-ZAP '85 with a different color scheme and a different sub and special weapon. It is modeled after the NES Zapper after its redesign in 1989 due to a law requiring that all toy guns have an orange tip or exterior.",
    "The N-ZAP '89 is similar in appearance to the N-ZAP '85. However, the N-ZAP '89 has an orange barrel and handhold instead of gray and a black trigger instead of red.",
    "The N-ZAP '89 was released on 18 July 2015 at 02:00 UTC.[1] It comes in a set with Sprinklers and the Inkstrike.",
    "[2]",
    "Ah yes, the N-ZAP '89. This is quite simply an N-ZAP '85 that was redesigned for... legal reasons. It includes a Sprinkler to rapidly increase your turf, allowing you to fire off remarkably fast Inkstrikes! This set is excellent at striking where the foe least expects it. Good for lone wolves!(NA)",
    "Ah yes, the N-ZAP '89. This is simply a redecorated version of the N-ZAP '85. It includes a Sprinkler to rapidly increase your turf, allowing you to fire off remarkably fast Inkstrikes! Overall, this set is excellent at striking where the foe least expects it. Perfect for lone wolves!(EU/OC)",
    "The N-ZAP '89 was released on 9 December 2017 at 02:00 UTC.[4] It comes in a set with Autobombs and the Tenta Missiles.",
    "[5][6]",
    "The N-ZAP '89 is a later model of the N-ZAP '85. Same features, different color! At first glance, the included Autobombs and Tenta Missiles make this look like the perfect support set for smoking out enemies. And that's not wrong, but you can also use this set to push forward aggressively! So I'd recommend this for players that like to adapt their style to the state of the battle!",
    "The N-ZAP '89 returns in Splatoon 3, with an unchanged design. It has the Autobomb and the Super Chump. It was released as part of the Fresh Season 2023 update. It was first teased in the Fresh Season poster released on 16 February 2023, with its official announcement coming on 17 February 2023. It released on 28 February 2023.",
    "[7]",
    "Is the N-ZAP '89 faster, better, or more powerful than the N-ZAP '85? No, but it comes in a new color! And this one comes with Autobombs to help you secure the area before launching an offensive. Sniff out enemies, and point your team in the right direction! Now, if your opponents think they're clever and keep camping near your Super Jump spots, this set allows you to hit 'em with the Super Chump! It'll fire decoys that look like Super Jump landing spots...but are in fact ticking ink bombs that will explode within a few seconds. Try this set if you want to be the one playing chess while your enemies play checkers!",
    "N-ZAP '89 is a shortened form of NES Zapper 1989. 89 is based on the year the second, orange NES Zapper model was released.",
    "The N-ZAP '89 has the same name origin in all regions.",

This is referenced in Sheldon's description of the weapon, stating the design had to be changed due to \"legal reasons.\"",
