  "content": "The N-ZAP '89 is a main weapon in the Splatoon series. It is a N-ZAP '85 with a different color scheme and a different sub and special weapon. It is modeled after the NES Zapper after its redesign in 1989 due to a law requiring that all toy guns have an orange tip or exterior.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Splatoon\n\n2.1 Data\n2.2 Version history\n2.3 Quotes\n2.4 Gallery\n2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3 Splatoon 2\n\n3.1 Data\n3.2 Version history\n3.3 Quotes\n3.4 Gallery\n3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 4 Splatoon 3\n\n4.1 Data\n4.2 Version history\n4.3 Quotes\n4.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n4.5 Gallery\n\n- 4.1 Data\n\n- 4.2 Version history\n\n- 4.3 Quotes\n\n- 4.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 4.5 Gallery\n\n- 5 Trivia\n\n- 6 Etymology\n\n6.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 6.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 7 References\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 4.1 Data\n\n- 4.2 Version history\n\n- 4.3 Quotes\n\n- 4.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 4.5 Gallery\n\n- 6.1 Names in other languages\n\nThe N-ZAP '89 is similar in appearance to the N-ZAP '85.

This set is excellent at striking where the foe least expects it. Good for lone wolves!(NA)\n\nAh yes, the N-ZAP '89. This is simply a redecorated version of the N-ZAP '85.

Same features, different color! At first glance, the included Autobombs and Tenta Missiles make this look like the perfect support set for smoking out enemies. And that's not wrong, but you can also use this set to push forward aggressively! So I'd recommend this for players that like to adapt their style to the state of the battle!\n\n- Promotional render\n\nThe N-ZAP '89 returns in Splatoon 3, with an unchanged design.

The original accessory was made orange in May 1989 after the Federal Energy Management Improvement Act of 1988 was passed, requiring toy guns to look drastically different from real guns. This is referenced in Sheldon's description of the weapon, stating the design had to be changed due to \"legal reasons.\"\n\n- The N-ZAP '89's textures include the same text as the N-ZAP '85, including the copyright year still saying 1985.\n\nN-ZAP '89 is a shortened form of NES Zapper 1989. 89 is based on the year the second, orange NES Zapper model was released.\n\nThe N-ZAP '89 has the same name origin in all regions."
