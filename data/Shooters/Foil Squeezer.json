You'll probably also like the Foil Squeezer! It offers the same capabilities with a new look and a new loadout. First, try deploying the Autobomb sub to sniff out hidden enemies. If the coast is clear, it's time to hold down the trigger and ink a ton of turf with your main. And with the Splattercolor Screen special, you can force enemies into more favorable positions to unleash the Foil Squeezer's powerful single-shot mode. KA-SPLOOSH! This loadout is designed to help you use both the sniping and turf-inking capabilities of your Foil Squeezer optimally, so I hope you'll give it a try!\n\n- Promotional render\n\n- An Octoling wielding the Foil Squeezer while affected by a Splattercolor Screen\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Foil Squeezer\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Foil_Squeezer_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nModel of the Foil Squeezer rotating (link to file)\n\nFor competitive tips about the Foil Squeezer\n\n- The Foil Squeezer is designed after a champagne bottle both in look and function, with the first powerful shot being like the popping cork and the following weaker stream emulating the foam spilling out afterwards."
