    "The Aerospray PG is a main weapon in Splatoon and Splatoon 2. The Aerospray PG fires quick bursts, so its user can cover a relatively large area with ink in a short time. It is also a short-range weapon, so it makes quick work of nearby targets.",
    "The Aerospray PG shares its overall design with the Aerospray MG. However, the Aerospray PG is almost entirely bronze. The nozzle and attachments supporting the tube are a dull metal color, and the Ammo Knights logo on the tank is white. The black tube at the back of the Aerospray PG appears to be shinier than the one on the other Aerosprays.",
    "The Aerospray PG is one of the nine weapons included in Sheldon's Picks Vol. 2 and was released on 8 June 2016. It is in a set with the Burst Bombs and the Kraken. Like the Aerospray MG and RG, the PG can only be purchased after defeating The Rampaging Octowhirl! boss battle and obtaining its Sunken Scroll.",

    "- The Aerospray PG appears to be designed after an aerograph, a type of airbrush.",
    "- This weapon is absent from Splatoon 3, likely in favor of the Colorz Aerospray being the new third variant of the Aerospray MG.",
    "The PG in this weapon's name likely stands for \"Perfect Grade\", referencing Bandai's line of 1:60 scale model kits for the anime Mobile Suit Gundam. This is because it is common for model kits to be painted with an airbrush and because Gundam models are extremely popular in Japan.",
    "In Sheldon's quote for the weapon in the North American and European/Oceania versions of Splatoon; \"Rated PG for severe splattings!\", is a reference to the same age rating the MPAA uses for theater films."
