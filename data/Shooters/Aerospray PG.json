  "content": "The Aerospray PG is a main weapon in Splatoon and Splatoon 2. The Aerospray PG fires quick bursts, so its user can cover a relatively large area with ink in a short time. It is also a short-range weapon, so it makes quick work of nearby targets.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Splatoon\n\n2.1 Data\n2.2 Quotes\n2.3 Gallery\n2.4 Demonstration\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Quotes\n\n- 2.3 Gallery\n\n- 2.4 Demonstration\n\n- 3 Splatoon 2\n\n3.1 Data\n3.2 Version history\n3.3 Quotes\n3.4 Gallery\n3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 4 Strategy\n\n- 5 Trivia\n\n- 6 Etymology\n\n6.1 Names in other languages\n\n6.1.1 Translation notes\n\n- 6.1 Names in other languages\n\n6.1.1 Translation notes\n\n- 6.1.1 Translation notes\n\n- 7 References\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Quotes\n\n- 2.3 Gallery\n\n- 2.4 Demonstration\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 6.1 Names in other languages\n\n6.1.1 Translation notes\n\n- 6.1.1 Translation notes\n\n- 6.1.1 Translation notes\n\nThe Aerospray PG shares its overall design with the Aerospray MG. However, the Aerospray PG is almost entirely bronze. The nozzle and attachments supporting the tube are a dull metal color, and the Ammo Knights logo on the tank is white. The black tube at the back of the Aerospray PG appears to be shinier than the one on the other Aerosprays.\n\nThe Aerospray PG is one of the nine weapons included in Sheldon's Picks Vol. 2 and was released on 8 June 2016.

The outer reticle will finish shrinking after 60 frames.\n\n- The chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle increases by 10% per shot, and maximizes at a 40% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle.\nThis means that it takes 4 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- This means that it takes 4 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- When jumping, the chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle is immediately set to 40%.\n\n- Accuracy starts recovering 4 frames after the player stops shooting.\n\n- Shots initially travel straight at a rate of 22 units per frame for 3 frames.

It's a hand-crafted work of art, if I do say so myself. I really put a lot of love into it! The Burst Bombs let you control your opponents' movements before smashing them with the Kraken. Rated PG for severe splattings!\n\n- Promotional image.\n\n- An Inkling boy runs with the Aerospray PG.\n\n- Firing the Aerospray PG.\n\n- Back view.\n\n- SplatNet icon\n\nThe Aerospray PG was released on 3 April 2019 at 01:00 UTC as part of version 4.6.0.[3] It comes with Burst Bombs and the Booyah Bomb.\n\n- The Aerospray PG is a lightweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 110. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The ink consumption of 0.55% and ink tank capacity of 100% allows players to fire 181 shots before needing to refill the ink supply.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- When initially firing the weapon in humanoid form, the first shot takes 3 frames to come out.\n\n- When firing from swim form, the first shot takes 10 frames to come out.\n\n- The interval between firing and when the player is able to enter swim form or use a sub weapon is 2 frames.\n\n- When firing continuously, it shoots a bullet every 4 frames (15 shots per second).\n\n- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.72 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 15 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Each shot has a base damage of 24.\n\n- If a shot is in the air for more than 8 frames after being fired, it loses 0.75 damage per frame until it reaches 12 damage at frame 24.\n\n- The bullet hitbox has a radius of 2 units.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while on the ground is 13 degrees.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while in the air is 16 degrees.\n\n- The outer reticle immediately expands after jumping. After 25 frames, the outer reticle will start shrinking, and will finish shrinking after 70 frames.\n\n- The Aerospray PG starts off having a 6% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle.\nThis chance increases by 3% per shot, and maximizes at a 50% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 15 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- This chance increases by 3% per shot, and maximizes at a 50% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 15 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- When jumping, the chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle is immediately set to 40%.\n\n- Accuracy starts recovering 4 frames after the player stops shooting. The chance to shoot towards the outer reticle decreases by 1% per frame, if the chance is not already at the minimum, meaning that it takes 48 frames to reach maximum accuracy. (38 after shooting while jumping.)\n\n- Shots initially travel straight at a rate of 22 units per frame for 3 frames. Shots travel straight for 66 distance units.\nAfter that, the shot's velocity is set to 18.945 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and decreases further as it travels.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 18.945 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and decreases further as it travels.\n\n- Ink droplets occur every 125 units.\n\n- The frequency at which ink drips from a shot occurs at a rate of 1 droplets per shot.\n\n- There are a total of 8 different droplet patterns that can be created while firing this weapon.\n\n- Droplets that occur within 21 units of the player have a radius of 20 units, and a width of 13 units.\nThese droplets have their radius multiplied by a value ranging from 1.2 if they fell from a height above 100 units to 1.4 if they fell from a height below 30 units.\n\n- These droplets have their radius multiplied by a value ranging from 1.2 if they fell from a height above 100 units to 1.4 if they fell from a height below 30 units.\n\n- Droplets that occur when they travel past 150 units of the player have a radius of 17.8 units.\n\n- All other ink droplets have a radius of 12 units.\n\n- Droplets that are far from the player and all other droplets have their radius multiplied by a value ranging from 1 if they fell from a height above 100 units to 1.2 if they fell from a height below 30 units.\n\n- If no ink droplets have occurred within 21 units of the player for 4 shots, the next shot the player makes will force a paint droplet to appear at the player's feet.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This chance increases by 3% per shot, and maximizes at a 50% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 15 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 18.945 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and decreases further as it travels.\n\n- These droplets have their radius multiplied by a value ranging from 1.2 if they fell from a height above 100 units to 1.4 if they fell from a height below 30 units.\n\n[4][5]\n\n- ▼ Points to fill special gauge: 180 → 190\n\n- ▲ Increased damage dealt to the umbrella portion of the following weapons by roughly 57%.\nTenta Brella\nTenta Sorella Brella\nTenta Camo Brella\n\n- Tenta Brella\n\n- Tenta Sorella Brella\n\n- Tenta Camo Brella\n\n- Tenta Brella\n\n- Tenta Sorella Brella\n\n- Tenta Camo Brella\n\n- ▲ Increased damage dealt to the Booyah Bomb armor by roughly 17%.\n\nThe Aerospray PG has been designed by and for masters of the art of splatting, and has been optimized and refined in every way imaginable! Keep your foes at tentacle's length with a barrage of Burst Bombs, all while inking a solid swath on your path to victory! And when the going gets tough, break out the Booyah Bomb to turn the tide of battle in your favor! For some, the key to victory is simple: just cover everything in ink. If this describes you, give this set a go!\n\n- Promotional image\n\nFor competitive tips about the Aerospray PG\n\n- The Aerospray PG appears to be designed after an aerograph, a type of airbrush.\n\n- This weapon is absent from Splatoon 3, likely in favor of the Colorz Aerospray being the new third variant of the Aerospray MG.\n\nThe PG in this weapon's name likely stands for \"Perfect Grade\", referencing Bandai's line of 1:60 scale model kits for the anime Mobile Suit Gundam. This is because it is common for model kits to be painted with an airbrush and because Gundam models are extremely popular in Japan.\n\nIn Sheldon's quote for the weapon in the North American and European/Oceania versions of Splatoon; \"Rated PG for severe splattings!\", is a reference to the same age rating the MPAA uses for theater films."
