    "The Hero Shot is a shooter in the Splatoon series that is exclusively used in single-player modes.",
    "In Splatoon, the Hero Shot is a futuristic weapon with a black and lime green color scheme and many glowing lights that leave a small trail as Agent 3 moves. The ink tank above the gun barrel has a similar style to paintball ammunition bottle.",
    "In Splatoon 2, it is based on the real-life FN P90 but yellow. The design bears little resemblance to the Hero Shot in Splatoon or the Splattershot.",
    "In Splatoon 3, the Hero Shot no longer has a futuristic design. The body is long, rectangular, and flat. It has no glowing lights and is a dull yellow color. The ink tank is placed at the back of the weapon, with wires the color of the player's ink wrapped around the weapon.",
    "The Hero Shot is used exclusively in the Octo Valley single-player and the Inkling Squid amiibo challenges. It behaves similarly to the Splattershot, with decent range, accuracy, fire rate, and damage. It is the only weapon in the game with multiple switchable sub weapons, using Splat Bombs, Burst Bombs, and Seekers, but only the Splat Bombs are usable during the amiibo challenges. Its fire rate and ink tank capacity can be upgraded separately with Power Eggs found in missions. Beating the final amiibo challenge unlocks the Hero Shot Replica for purchase at Ammo Knights.",
    "Note: These upgrades have no effect during the amiibo challenges.",
    "The Hero Shot was redesigned for Splatoon 2 and now comes with switchable sub weapons of Splat Bombs, Curling Bombs and Autobombs, although every other Hero weapon also has these. It is now only upgradable twice, while the other Hero weapons can be upgraded just once. Completing all missions in Octo Canyon with this weapon unlocks the Hero Shot Replica for purchase from Ammo Knights. Unlike in Splatoon, with no upgrades it has a fire rate similar to the .96 Gal.",
    "In Splatoon 3, the Hero Shot returns as Agent 3's primary weapon in Return of the Mammalians, used in the overworld and available in most kettles. Similarly to previous games, it can be upgraded twice in conjunction with the Hero Gear, changing its appearance, damage, and rate of fire. Its ink tank capacity can also be upgraded separately. It is equipped with four unlockable, switchable sub weapons (the most of any weapon), namely Smallfry, Splat Bombs, Burst Bombs and Curling Bombs. Completing the Alterna Space Center sequence unlocks the Hero Shot Replica for purchase from Ammo Knights. Note that other Hero Weapons do not appear in Return of the Mammalians: instead, kettles in Alterna allow the player to choose from up to three weapon sets for the level, similarly to stations in the Octo Expansion.",
    "The Hero Shot Replica is a reward in the Splatoon series unlocked through various means. It is a shooter-type main weapon and is visually identical to the Hero Shot. Despite its unique appearance, it is simply a reskin of the Splattershot from each game, sharing the same stats, loadout, sub weapon, and special weapon, and upgrade purchases through the Ammo Knights Enhancifier do not affect it.",
    "- The Level 3 Hero Shot (and its replica) in Splatoon 2 resembles a real-life FN P90.",
    "- The Hero Shot in Splatoon 2 is the only Hero weapon to not have a red accent when fully upgraded.",
    "- In the Octo Expansion, Agent 3 uses a Hero Shot with blue lights, presumably the same one used in Octo Valley, with the original design from the first game instead of the new design. However, it is implied that they have modified it since as it functions very differently than before.\nAgent 3 can dash at any time as if they had dualies, but the speed is slow like how the Drop Roller ability behaves.\nDuring Agent 8's fight, Agent 3 has removed the limiter for special weapons, meaning they can presumably use specials without having to charge them. It is also shown that Agent 3 can use multiple different special weapons. They use the Splashdown, Curling-Bomb Launcher, Baller, and Sting Ray during the initial fight. During the Inner Agent 3 fight, they use the Splashdown, Inkjet, Bubble Blower, Autobomb Launcher, and Tenta Missiles.\nIt is shown that Agent 3's Hero Shot still has a sub weapon of Splat Bombs during the Spinal Phase, but during Inner Agent 3, Autobombs are  the sub weapon. Considering Autobombs were not part of the original Hero Shot, it is likely Agent 3 modified the weapon to be able to use them, like how they removed the special limiter. This could mean that the Hero Shot still has switchable sub weapons, although it is unclear whether the events of Inner Agent 3 actually happened or if it was an imaginary battle.",
