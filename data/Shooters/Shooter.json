Most shooters are fully automatic, continuously firing when the player holds the trigger.\n\n- 1 General mechanics\n\n- 2 Blasters\n\n- 3 List of shooters\n\n3.1 Special shooters\n\n- 3.1 Special shooters\n\n- 4 Sets\n\n- 5 Animations\n\n5.1 Splatoon\n5.2 Splatoon 2\n5.3 Splatoon 3\n\n- 5.1 Splatoon\n\n- 5.2 Splatoon 2\n\n- 5.3 Splatoon 3\n\n- 6 Quotes\n\n6.1 Splatoon\n6.2 Splatoon 3\n\n- 6.1 Splatoon\n\n- 6.2 Splatoon 3\n\n- 7 Gallery\n\n7.1 SplatNet icons\n7.2 2D icons\n7.3 In-game\n7.4 Art\n7.5 Promotional renders for Splatoon 2\n7.6 Promotional renders for Splatoon 3\n7.7 Tableturf Battle cards for Splatoon 3\n\n- 7.1 SplatNet icons\n\n- 7.2 2D icons\n\n- 7.3 In-game\n\n- 7.4 Art\n\n- 7.5 Promotional renders for Splatoon 2\n\n- 7.6 Promotional renders for Splatoon 3\n\n- 7.7 Tableturf Battle cards for Splatoon 3\n\n- 8 Trivia\n\n8.1 Splatoon\n8.2 Splatoon 2\n8.3 Splatoon 3\n\n- 8.1 Splatoon\n\n- 8.2 Splatoon 2\n\n- 8.3 Splatoon 3\n\n- 9 Names in other languages\n\n9.1 Translation notes\n\n- 9.1 Translation notes\n\n- 10 Notes\n\n- 11 References\n\n- 3.1 Special shooters\n\n- 5.1 Splatoon\n\n- 5.2 Splatoon 2\n\n- 5.3 Splatoon 3\n\n- 6.1 Splatoon\n\n- 6.2 Splatoon 3\n\n- 7.1 SplatNet icons\n\n- 7.2 2D icons\n\n- 7.3 In-game\n\n- 7.4 Art\n\n- 7.5 Promotional renders for Splatoon 2\n\n- 7.6 Promotional renders for Splatoon 3\n\n- 7.7 Tableturf Battle cards for Splatoon 3\n\n- 8.1 Splatoon\n\n- 8.2 Splatoon 2\n\n- 8.3 Splatoon 3\n\n- 9.1 Translation notes\n\nShooters are ostensibly mechanically basic, only requiring pressing  for all forms of operation.\n\nHowever, some shooters are semi-automatic (firing one bullet per trigger press) or burst-fire (firing multiple bullets per trigger press), and consequently these weapons may benefit from or even require repeated taps of .\n\nBlasters are fully-automatic weapons that fire large globs of ink that travel forward and conclude their path with an explosion and typically have a lower fire rate and higher ink consumption than many shooters. Prior to Splatoon 3, they were classified as shooters.\n\nNote: The series are arranged by their respective order in the weapon select screen with the Main filter.\n\nThe following special shooters are only available outside of battles as part of other modes:\n\nVictory:\n\n- Inkling girl: Flails her arms around, jumps once with her arms over her head, then thrusts the weapon out.\n\n- Inkling boy: Jumps once while swinging the weapon forwards, does a fist pump with both arms, throws the weapon in the air, then catches the spinning weapon, holding the weapon across his chest.\n\nDefeat:\n\n- Both genders get on their knees with their left hand down while swinging their weapon up and down in disappointment.\n\nIn Ammo Knights (Clicking ):\n\n- Both genders hold the weapon high, then lowers it, poses like they are shooting, then looks behind the weapon, and returns to idle pose.\n\nSpawning in before a match starts:\n\n- Both Inklings and Octolings point their weapon down at a 45-degree angle after shaking off their excess ink.\n\nVictory:\n\n- Inkling girl: Jumps up and down twice before spinning around once and strikes a pose while pointing her weapon up.\n\n- Inkling boy: Jumps up and thrusts his left fist forward before raising it over his chest while holding his weapon downward.\n\n- Octoling girl: Winces before twirling her weapon and ending it pointing upward at an angle while having her left hand on her hip in a pose.\n\n- Octoling boy: Similar to the Octoling girl's but stands up straight.\n\nDefeat:\n\n- Inkling girl: Throws a fit.\n\n- Inkling boy: Sits down on the ground and holds his head in frustration.\n\n- Octoling girl: Falls down to the ground, dropping her weapon in front of her, then turns her head away in anger.\n\n- Octoling boy: Similar to the Inkling boy's but lays his weapon behind him and puts his right arm on his right knee.\n\nIn Ammo Knights (Clicking ):\n\n- Inklings: Raises and lowers their weapon, looking it over, gets into a shooting stance, then looks down the weapon from behind.\n\n- Octolings: Looks over their weapon from the side and back, bends over slightly, and aims around before sighing.\n\nSpawner pose:\n\n- All styles: Leaps out of the spawner with their weapon pointing upwards, then lands with it held across their torso.\n\nVictory:\n\n- Flip Out: Backflips twice, spinning the second time, and lands with the weapon pointed backwards, before pointing to the sky with their left hand.\n\n- Reppin' Inkopolis: The player jumps for joy three times, then points their weapon into the air with a smile.\n\n- The Square Show-Off: The player jumps for joy twice, before spinning on the third jump and pointing their weapon upwards and placing their left fist on their hip.\n\nIn Ammo Knights (Clicking ):\n\n- Inklings: Looks over weapon from side and back, bends over slightly and takes aim, holds weapon with their left hand and aims before standing and flipping the weapon over their head, catching it, and returning to idle pose.\n\n- Octolings: Looks down at weapon, smiles and gets into a crouch pose, holds the weapon with their right hand and points the weapon up, puts both hands on the weapon and gets into a shooting stance angled to the left, looks back at camera with the weapon held across their torso.\n\n- Splattershot Jr.\n\n- Custom Splattershot Jr.\n\n-
