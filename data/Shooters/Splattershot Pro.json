    "The Splattershot Pro is a main weapon in the Splatoon series, created by Splat.",
    "The main part of the Splattershot Pro seems to be a large, crayon-shaped canister that changes color to match the user's ink. Over the top of this is a gray and blue mechanism that keeps the canister inserted, and around the canister are two gray straps that connect it to the weapon's frame. The back of the canister has a blue cap with a red tube. Attached to the trigger piece is a dark blue handhold that connects to the identically colored nozzle. The tip of the nozzle and trigger are red.",
    "The Splattershot Pro is an advanced weapon in terms of power and range, making it easy to use for more experienced players. Though it boasts superior range and power when compared to the Splattershot, it is inferior to the Splattershot in turf coverage and fire rate. It comes in a set with the Splat Bombs and Inkstrike.",
