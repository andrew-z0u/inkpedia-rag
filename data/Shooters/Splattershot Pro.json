    "The Splattershot Pro is a main weapon in the Splatoon series, created by Splat.",
    "The main part of the Splattershot Pro seems to be a large, crayon-shaped canister that changes color to match the user's ink. Over the top of this is a gray and blue mechanism that keeps the canister inserted, and around the canister are two gray straps that connect it to the weapon's frame. The back of the canister has a blue cap with a red tube. Attached to the trigger piece is a dark blue handhold that connects to the identically colored nozzle. The tip of the nozzle and trigger are red.",
    "The Splattershot Pro is an advanced weapon in terms of power and range, making it easy to use for more experienced players. Though it boasts superior range and power when compared to the Splattershot, it is inferior to the Splattershot in turf coverage and fire rate. It comes in a set with the Splat Bombs and Inkstrike.",
    "[1]",
    "The Splattershot Pro was developed for more advanced users by the team behind the Splattershot! Unbalance your foes with Splat Bombs and Inkstrikes, and then hit them with superb range and accuracy! Its ink efficiency and fire rate aren't as good as the standard Splattershot's hence the \"pro.\"",
    "The Splattershot Pro returns in Splatoon 2 looking identical to how it did in the first game. It comes with the Point Sensor and Ink Storm.",
    "It appears in one Octo Expansion station:",
    "[2][3]",
    "The Splattershot Pro was developed for more advanced users by the team behind the Splattershot! Use the Point Sensor to reveal opponents, and then blast them with the incredible precision and range of the main weapon! Its fire rate and ink efficiency aren't the best, but you can cover your teammates with an Ink Storm! I'd recommend this weapon to players who have a lot of faith in their accuracy and positioning!",
    "The Splattershot Pro returns in Splatoon 3. It has a new design, namely new Inkling text on its ink tank and its holders are now blue. Its kit consists of Angle Shooter and Crab Tank.",
    "It appears in two missions in Return of the Mammalians:",
    "[4]",
    "The Splattershot Pro was developed for more advanced users by the same team that brought you the Splattershot! And here's a \"pro\" strategy for using it - deploy the Angle Shooter to limit your opponent's movement, then take advantage of the Pro's accuracy and range to splat 'em from downtown. Of course, sometimes you just want to crush your enemies with a crustacean, and that's where the Crab Tank comes in. Putting it all together is easier said than done, but this setup is built for players who dare to dream.",
