Over the top of this is a gray and blue mechanism that keeps the canister inserted, and around the canister are two gray straps that connect it to the weapon's frame. The back of the canister has a blue cap with a red tube. Attached to the trigger piece is a dark blue handhold that connects to the identically colored nozzle. The tip of the nozzle and trigger are red.\n\nThe Splattershot Pro is an advanced weapon in terms of power and range, making it easy to use for more experienced players.

Unbalance your foes with Splat Bombs and Inkstrikes, and then hit them with superb range and accuracy! Its ink efficiency and fire rate aren't as good as the standard Splattershot's hence the \"pro.\"\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- 3D art of an Inkling girl holding the Splattershot Pro.\n\n- In-game render of an Inkling girl holding the Splattershot Pro.\n\n- An Inkling boy (second from right) firing the Splattershot Pro.\n\n- Official art of an Inkling holding the Splattershot Pro.\n\n- SplatNet icon\n\nThe Splattershot Pro returns in Splatoon 2 looking identical to how it did in the first game.

Splattershot! Use the Point Sensor to reveal opponents, and then blast them with the incredible precision and range of the main weapon! Its fire rate and ink efficiency aren't the best, but you can cover your teammates with an Ink Storm! I'd recommend this weapon to players who have a lot of faith in their accuracy and positioning!\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- An Inkling boy firing the Splattershot Pro.\n\n- An Inkling boy firing the Splattershot Pro in mid-air.\n\nThe Splattershot Pro returns in Splatoon 3.

And here's a \"pro\" strategy for using it - deploy the Angle Shooter to limit your opponent's movement, then take advantage of the Pro's accuracy and range to splat 'em from downtown. Of course, sometimes you just want to crush your enemies with a crustacean, and that's where the Crab Tank comes in. Putting it all together is easier said than done, but this setup is built for players who dare to dream.\n\n- An Octoling holding the Splattershot Pro.\n\n- The central Inkling wields the Splattershot Pro.\n\n- 2D icon.\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Splattershot Pro.\n\n- Unused early version of the Splattershot Pro's Tableturf Battle card.

It also has the shortened form of professional at the end to denote it is a weapon for advanced players.\n\nIts Japanese name, プライムシューター puraimu shūtā, means \"Prime Shooter\"."
