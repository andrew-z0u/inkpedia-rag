    "The Neo Splash-o-matic is a main weapon in the Splatoon series. It is the Neo-branded variant of the the Splash-o-matic and comes with a different sub and special weapon.",

    "The Neo Splash-o-matic was released on 22 July 2015 at 02:00 UTC.[1] It comes with Burst Bombs and the Inkzooka.",
    "[2]",
    "The Neo Splash-o-matic has the same capabilities as the original set, but with new sub and special weapons.\nHit your opponent with Burst Bombs, and then give them a taste of precision shooting!\nWith the Inkzooka too, this is a set for an aggressive sharpshooter who's not afraid to get messy!(NA)",
    "The Neo Splash-o-matic returns in Splatoon 2. It was released on 25 April 2018 as part of Version 3.0.0. It comes with Burst Bombs and the Suction-Bomb Launcher.",

    "The Neo Splash-o-matic returns in Splatoon 3 as part of Fresh Season 2023, now with a silver color scheme and sticker. Its kit consists of the Suction Bomb and Triple Inkstrike. It was first teased in a promotional image for the Suction Bomb in August 2022, being shown only as an alternate variant of the Splash-o-matic with an unfinished design. It was eventually revealed to be returning to Splatoon 3 on 16 February 2023 as part of Fresh Season 2023, and released on 28 February 2023.",

    "If you're a Splash-o-matic fan, you owe it to yourself to try out the Neo Splash-o-matic. Neo means new, and Splash-o-matic means Splash-o-matic! That's my way of explaining that the Neo Splash-o-matic has the same characteristics as the Splash-o-matic but with a new design and a new sub and special. If I can stop saying Splash-o-matic for two seconds, I can tell you what they are. Whew! Did it. This loadout comes with Suction Bombs, a classic go-to, if you ask me. And for the special? Nothing less than the Triple Inkstrike, which strikes three times the fear into your opponents' hearts. Use this sub and special well, and there will be nothing left to do but pick off your enemies one by one with the Neo Splash-o-matic. No! I said it again!",
    "For competitive tips about the Neo Splash-o-matic",
    "Neo Splash-o-matic is derived from Splash and Automatic, plus the prefix Neo, Ancient Greek for \"new\". The prefix Neo is also used to differentiate it from the Splash-o-matic. This trait is shared among the other alternate sets of the Neo brand. The -o-matic suffix is also a common, cliché naming convention for technological gadgets.",
