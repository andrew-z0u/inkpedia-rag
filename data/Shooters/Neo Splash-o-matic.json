Neo means new, and Splash-o-matic means Splash-o-matic! That's my way of explaining that the Neo Splash-o-matic has the same characteristics as the Splash-o-matic but with a new design and a new sub and special. If I can stop saying Splash-o-matic for two seconds, I can tell you what they are. Whew! Did it. This loadout comes with Suction Bombs, a classic go-to, if you ask me. And for the special? Nothing less than the Triple Inkstrike, which strikes three times the fear into your opponents' hearts. Use this sub and special well, and there will be nothing left to do but pick off your enemies one by one with the Neo Splash-o-matic. No! I said it again!\n\n- An early Neo Splash-o-matic user tossing a Suction Bomb.\n\n- The Fresh Season 2023 poster teasing the Neo Splash-o-matic.\n\n- Promotional render\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Neo Splash-o-matic.\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Splash-o-Matic_Neo_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nModel of the Neo Splash-o-matic rotating (Link to file)\n\nFor competitive tips about the Neo Splash-o-matic\n\n- The Wandercrust reward for Ammo Knights (Inkopolis) features a Neo Splash-o-matic icon, which sports an older version of the weapon icon.\n\nNeo Splash-o-matic is derived from Splash and Automatic, plus the prefix Neo, Ancient Greek for \"new\". The prefix Neo is also used to differentiate it from the Splash-o-matic. This trait is shared among the other alternate sets of the Neo brand. The -o-matic suffix is also a common, cliché naming convention for technological gadgets.\n\nシャープマーカーネオ Shāpu mākā neo references the pen-based appearance of the Neo Splash-o-matic.
