  "content": "The Splattershot Jr. is a main weapon in the Splatoon series, coming from the weapon brand Splat. It is the first weapon used by all players, given at the start of the in-game tutorial.\n\nAs the beginner weapon, the Splattershot Jr. appropriately has a quick firing rate, a high ink efficiency, and high shot spread, which enables its user to quickly ink large territories. Its loadout always includes both an offensive option and a strong defensive option. Since version 3.2.0 of Splatoon 2, it is also the first weapon to feature a unique ink tank.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Splatoon\n\n2.1 Data\n2.2 Version history\n2.3 Quotes\n2.4 Gallery\n2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3 Splatoon 2\n\n3.1 Data\n3.2 Version history\n3.3 Quotes\n3.4 Gallery\n3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 4 Splatoon 3\n\n4.1 Data\n4.2 Version history\n4.3 Quotes\n4.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n4.5 Gallery\n\n- 4.1 Data\n\n- 4.2 Version history\n\n- 4.3 Quotes\n\n- 4.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 4.5 Gallery\n\n- 5 Strategy\n\n- 6 Trivia\n\n- 7 Etymology\n\n7.1 Names in other languages\n7.2 Translation notes\n\n- 7.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 7.2 Translation notes\n\n- 8 References\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 4.1 Data\n\n- 4.2 Version history\n\n- 4.3 Quotes\n\n- 4.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 4.5 Gallery\n\n- 7.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 7.2 Translation notes\n\nThe Splattershot Jr. is a blocky squirt gun, the main part of which changes color to match the user's ink. The gun has a large rectangular prism for a body, with another rectangular prism, this one much smaller, extending down to serve as a handhold. The inside angle between the two prisms houses a purple trigger. On the end of the main prism facing away from the user is a stocky, square-shaped funnel with a short purple nozzle on the end, and on top of it is a purple cap connected to the body by two small trapezoidal prisms. Inside the gun, there is a dip tube that connects the bottom of the trigger handhold to the nozzle. The Splattershot Jr.'s body is translucent in Splatoon and Splatoon 3, while it is opaque in Splatoon 2. In the first game only, the Splattershot Jr. is mottled gray around the edges.\n\nIn Splatoon 2, the Splattershot Jr. and its variants also replace the user's standard ink tank with one resembling baby bottles. It has a rounded rectangular shape and a round cap. For the Splattershot Jr., a yellow tag bearing the \"Jr. Mark\" symbol seen on the Basic Tee is attached around the bottle's neck.\n\nThe Splattershot Jr. comes in a set with Splat Bombs and the Bubbler.\n\n- The Splattershot Jr. is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- Each shot consumes 0.5% of the ink tank capacity.\nThis allows players to fire 200 shots before needing to refill the ink supply.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This allows players to fire 200 shots before needing to refill the ink supply.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- When firing continuously, it shoots a bullet every 5 frames (12 shots per second).\n\n- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.72 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 20 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Each shot has a base damage of 28.\n\n- Shots travel straight for 3 frames.

It comes with Splat Bombs and Ink Armor. As of version 3.2.0, the Splattershot Jr. and its variants, the Custom Splattershot Jr. and Kensa Splattershot Jr., now have a larger ink tank with 10% more capacity, making it an easier weapon for beginners and experts alike. It should be noted that the Splattershot Jr. does not gain more ink tank capacity in Salmon Run.\n\nIt appears in three Octo Expansion stations:\n\n- Abandoned Station (warehouse area)\n\n- B11 Tubular 8-Ball Station\n\n- G04 B10 Ink 'n' Slide Station\n\n- The Splattershot Jr. is a lightweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 110. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The ink consumption of 0.43% and ink tank capacity of 110% allows players to fire 255 shots before needing to refill the ink supply.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- When initially firing the weapon in humanoid form, the first shot takes 3 frames to come out.\n\n- When firing from swim form, the first shot takes 10 frames to come out.\n\n- The interval between firing and when the player is able to enter swim form or use a sub weapon is 2 frames.\n\n- When firing continuously, it shoots a bullet every 5 frames (12 shots per second).\n\n- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.72 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 15 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Each shot has a base damage of 28.\n\n- If a shot is in the air for more than 8 frames after being fired, it loses 0.875 damage per frame until it reaches 14 damage at frame 24.\n\n- The bullet hitbox has a radius of 2 units.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while on the ground is 12 degrees.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while in the air is 15 degrees.\n\n- The outer reticle immediately expands after jumping.
