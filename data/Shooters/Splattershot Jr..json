    "The Splattershot Jr. is a main weapon in the Splatoon series, coming from the weapon brand Splat. It is the first weapon used by all players, given at the start of the in-game tutorial.",
    "As the beginner weapon, the Splattershot Jr. appropriately has a quick firing rate, a high ink efficiency, and high shot spread, which enables its user to quickly ink large territories. Its loadout always includes both an offensive option and a strong defensive option. Since version 3.2.0 of Splatoon 2, it is also the first weapon to feature a unique ink tank.",
    "The Splattershot Jr. is a blocky squirt gun, the main part of which changes color to match the user's ink. The gun has a large rectangular prism for a body, with another rectangular prism, this one much smaller, extending down to serve as a handhold. The inside angle between the two prisms houses a purple trigger. On the end of the main prism facing away from the user is a stocky, square-shaped funnel with a short purple nozzle on the end, and on top of it is a purple cap connected to the body by two small trapezoidal prisms. Inside the gun, there is a dip tube that connects the bottom of the trigger handhold to the nozzle. The Splattershot Jr.'s body is translucent in Splatoon and Splatoon 3, while it is opaque in Splatoon 2. In the first game only, the Splattershot Jr. is mottled gray around the edges.",
    "In Splatoon 2, the Splattershot Jr. and its variants also replace the user's standard ink tank with one resembling baby bottles. It has a rounded rectangular shape and a round cap. For the Splattershot Jr., a yellow tag bearing the \"Jr. Mark\" symbol seen on the Basic Tee is attached around the bottle's neck.",
