    "The Splattershot Jr. is a main weapon in the Splatoon series, coming from the weapon brand Splat. It is the first weapon used by all players, given at the start of the in-game tutorial.",
    "As the beginner weapon, the Splattershot Jr. appropriately has a quick firing rate, a high ink efficiency, and high shot spread, which enables its user to quickly ink large territories. Its loadout always includes both an offensive option and a strong defensive option. Since version 3.2.0 of Splatoon 2, it is also the first weapon to feature a unique ink tank.",
    "The Splattershot Jr. is a blocky squirt gun, the main part of which changes color to match the user's ink. The gun has a large rectangular prism for a body, with another rectangular prism, this one much smaller, extending down to serve as a handhold. The inside angle between the two prisms houses a purple trigger. On the end of the main prism facing away from the user is a stocky, square-shaped funnel with a short purple nozzle on the end, and on top of it is a purple cap connected to the body by two small trapezoidal prisms. Inside the gun, there is a dip tube that connects the bottom of the trigger handhold to the nozzle. The Splattershot Jr.'s body is translucent in Splatoon and Splatoon 3, while it is opaque in Splatoon 2. In the first game only, the Splattershot Jr. is mottled gray around the edges.",
    "In Splatoon 2, the Splattershot Jr. and its variants also replace the user's standard ink tank with one resembling baby bottles. It has a rounded rectangular shape and a round cap. For the Splattershot Jr., a yellow tag bearing the \"Jr. Mark\" symbol seen on the Basic Tee is attached around the bottle's neck.",
    "The Splattershot Jr. comes in a set with Splat Bombs and the Bubbler.",
    "[1]",
    "The Splattershot Jr. returns in Splatoon 2, once again as the starting weapon, looking identical to how it did in Splatoon. It comes with Splat Bombs and Ink Armor. As of version 3.2.0, the Splattershot Jr. and its variants, the Custom Splattershot Jr. and Kensa Splattershot Jr., now have a larger ink tank with 10% more capacity, making it an easier weapon for beginners and experts alike. It should be noted that the Splattershot Jr. does not gain more ink tank capacity in Salmon Run.",
    "It appears in three Octo Expansion stations:",
    "[2][3]",
    "The Splattershot Jr. is the classic entry-level Turf War weapon! It's a great companion for learning the basics of battle. It has a great rate of fire and efficient in use to boot. Plus it sprays ink so wildly you're bound to hit something! Splat Bombs are super effective at smoking out hidden opponents and clearing your path! And the Ink Armor special is great for support, making this set an excellent choice for players who appreciate balance!",
    "The Splattershot Jr. returns in Splatoon 3. Its kit consists of Splat Bomb and Big Bubbler. The Splattershot Jr. retains its 110% capacity ink tank,[4] which it first received in Splatoon 2 version 3.2.0. The ink tank is not visually larger than other ink tanks as it was in Splatoon 2, but the red line is lower, indicating that the Splat Bomb uses a smaller proportion of the capacity compared to a normal-sized ink tank.",
    "It appears in one mission in Return of the Mammalians:",
    "[5]",
    "For competitive tips about the Splattershot Jr.",
    "Splattershot Jr. is a combination of Splatter (as well as Splat) and Shot. It also has the shortened form of Junior (\"Jr.\") at the end to denote it is a weapon for beginners.",
