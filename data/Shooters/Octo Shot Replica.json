The main parts of the gun are a black body with a pistol grip and trigger, a foregrip attached to the barrel, and an ink tank which changes color to match the user's ink. The ink tank is connected to the body via an elongated metal tube at the back (which sticks out much further than the Splattershot's rear tube) and a black strip wrapping around the top of the tank, attaching it to the body. On the end of the body is a gray metal nozzle.\n\nThe Octoshot Replica was released with the 2.0.0 update on 6 August 2015 at 02:00 UTC. The Octoshot Replica is based on the Octoshots used by Octolings, looking like a sleeker, more metallic version of the Splattershot.\n\nIt cannot be purchased, instead being obtained as a reward from Judd for reaching Level 40. The Octoshot Replica's stats, sub weapon, and special weapon are identical to those of the Tentatek Splattershot. It generally has middling stats with no particular strengths or weaknesses. It comes with Suction Bombs and the Inkzooka. It was introduced in version 2.0.0 with the addition of Judd's rewards.\n\n- The Octo Shot Replica is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- Each shot consumes 0.9% of the ink tank capacity.\nThis allows players to fire 111 shots before needing to refill the ink supply.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This allows players to fire 111 shots before needing to refill the ink supply.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- When firing continuously, it shoots a bullet every 6 frames (10 shots per second).\n\n- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.72 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 20 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Each shot has a base damage of 35.\n\n- Shots travel straight for 4 frames.
