That would not be allowed, because the Inkzooka had already been taken by the Tentatek Splattershot.\n\n- This weapon was absent from Splatoon 2, likely in favor of the Kensa Splattershot being the new third variant of the Splattershot.\nHowever, Splatoon 3 would later add in a new variant of the Tentatek Splattershot that featured Splat Bombs and the Triple Inkstrike, making it a successor to the Wasabi Splattershot's toolset.\nThe Wasabi Splattershot itself remains absent from Splatoon 3, in favor of the Glamorz Splattershot being the third variant instead.\n\n- However, Splatoon 3 would later add in a new variant of the Tentatek Splattershot that featured Splat Bombs and the Triple Inkstrike, making it a successor to the Wasabi Splattershot's toolset.\n\n- The Wasabi Splattershot itself remains absent from Splatoon 3, in favor of the Glamorz Splattershot being the third variant instead.\n\n- However, Splatoon 3 would later add in a new variant of the Tentatek Splattershot that featured Splat Bombs and the Triple Inkstrike, making it a successor to the Wasabi Splattershot's toolset.\n\n- The Wasabi Splattershot itself remains absent from Splatoon 3, in favor of the Glamorz Splattershot being the third variant instead.\n\nWasabi Splattershot is a combination of Splatter (as well as Splat) and Shot. It also has the word Wasabi as a prefix to differentiate it from the Splattershot and the Tentatek Splattershot. The word Wasabi most likely refers to its color scheme.\n\nIts Japanese name, スプラシューターワサビ Supurashūtā Wasabi, is a combination of either Splat or Splash, and Shooter. It contains the word \"Wasabi\" for the same reasons as its English name."
