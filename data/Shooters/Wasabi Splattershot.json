    "The Wasabi Splattershot is a main weapon in Splatoon. It is a recolored variant of the Splattershot.",
    "The Wasabi Splattershot shares its overall design with the Splattershot. However, the body of the Wasabi Splattershot is dark-green with a lime-green grip and a lime-green nozzle, the opposite of the Splattershot. The red on the tube and nozzle is replaced with bright yellow. On the ink tank is a black and gold sticker bearing the Neo logo.",
    "The Wasabi Splattershot was first announced during the Nintendo Direct on 3 March 2016. It is one of eight weapons included in Sheldon's Picks Vol. 1 and was released at  02:00 UTC on 13 April 2016.[1] It comes with Splat Bombs and the Inkstrike.",

    "- The European Nintendo Direct incorrectly showed the Wasabi Splattershot's special weapon as the Inkzooka instead of the Inkstrike. That would not be allowed, because the Inkzooka had already been taken by the Tentatek Splattershot.",
    "- This weapon was absent from Splatoon 2, likely in favor of the Kensa Splattershot being the new third variant of the Splattershot.\nHowever, Splatoon 3 would later add in a new variant of the Tentatek Splattershot that featured Splat Bombs and the Triple Inkstrike, making it a successor to the Wasabi Splattershot's toolset.\nThe Wasabi Splattershot itself remains absent from Splatoon 3, in favor of the Glamorz Splattershot being the third variant instead.",
    "Wasabi Splattershot is a combination of Splatter (as well as Splat) and Shot. It also has the word Wasabi as a prefix to differentiate it from the Splattershot and the Tentatek Splattershot. The word Wasabi most likely refers to its color scheme.",
    "Its Japanese name, スプラシューターワサビ Supurashūtā Wasabi, is a combination of either Splat or Splash, and Shooter. It contains the word \"Wasabi\" for the same reasons as its English name."
