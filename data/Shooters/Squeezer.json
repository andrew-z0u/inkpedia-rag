    "The Squeezer is a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3. It is a shooter-type weapon that can be used close or long-range. Pulling the trigger once shoots a single long-range, low-spread, high-power ink shot, and holding the button leads to successive short-range, high-spread, lower-powered shots. The long-range shots have a slightly longer range than the Splattershot Pro while the short-ranged shots have a range similar to the Splattershot.",
    "The Squeezer is a champagne bottle turned sideways. The bottle has a wooden handle and a metal trigger near the bottom, and most of the bottle is wrapped in red and white foil. Going around the middle of the bottle and over the cork are some metal attachments likely designed to keep the cork in place.",
    "The Squeezer was announced as a part of version 2.0.0 and released on 22 December 2017 at  02:00 UTC.[1] It comes with Splash Wall and Sting Ray.",
    "It appears in three Octo Expansion stations:",
    "[2][3]",
    "The Squeezer main is a new type of shooter with multiple firing modes. Squeezing  once will squirt out a single high-power ink shot! But you can also hold down  to fire continuously, allowing you to ink the turf around you in a hurry! Press  repeatedly when fighting to maximize your damage output, and hold  when inking turf for maximum ink coverage! You can set up a Splash Wall to protect your team, and put far-off foes on notice with the Sting Ray special!",
    "Squeezer returns in Splatoon 3 with Splash Walls and the Trizooka for its kit.",
    "It appears in two missions in Return of the Mammalians:",
    "[4]",
    "The Squeezer is a great choice for players who want flexibility. Pull the trigger once, and you get a single high-powered shot. But holding down  changes everything! Suddenly the rate of fire goes up, and the Squeezer transforms into an absolute turf-inking machine. Master both modes, and you'll barely even need the Splash Wall to shore up your defenses. But it's there for you anyway! And with a Trizooka to tame far-off enemies, this set is built for flashy fighters who are comfortable being the center of attention.",
