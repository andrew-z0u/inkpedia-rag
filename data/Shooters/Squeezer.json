    "The Squeezer is a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3. It is a shooter-type weapon that can be used close or long-range. Pulling the trigger once shoots a single long-range, low-spread, high-power ink shot, and holding the button leads to successive short-range, high-spread, lower-powered shots. The long-range shots have a slightly longer range than the Splattershot Pro while the short-ranged shots have a range similar to the Splattershot.",
    "The Squeezer is a champagne bottle turned sideways. The bottle has a wooden handle and a metal trigger near the bottom, and most of the bottle is wrapped in red and white foil. Going around the middle of the bottle and over the cork are some metal attachments likely designed to keep the cork in place.",
    "The Squeezer was announced as a part of version 2.0.0 and released on 22 December 2017 at  02:00 UTC.[1] It comes with Splash Wall and Sting Ray.",
