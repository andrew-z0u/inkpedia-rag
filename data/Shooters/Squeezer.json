  "content": "The Squeezer is a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3. It is a shooter-type weapon that can be used close or long-range. Pulling the trigger once shoots a single long-range, low-spread, high-power ink shot, and holding the button leads to successive short-range, high-spread, lower-powered shots. The long-range shots have a slightly longer range than the Splattershot Pro while the short-ranged shots have a range similar to the Splattershot.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Splatoon 2\n\n2.1 Data\n\n2.1.1 Burst fire mode (pressing ZR)\n2.1.2 Continuous fire mode (holding ZR)\n\n\n2.2 Version history\n2.3 Quotes\n2.4 Gallery\n2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n2.1.1 Burst fire mode (pressing ZR)\n2.1.2 Continuous fire mode (holding ZR)\n\n- 2.1.1 Burst fire mode (pressing ZR)\n\n- 2.1.2 Continuous fire mode (holding ZR)\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3 Splatoon 3\n\n3.1 Data\n\n3.1.1 Burst fire mode (pressing ZR)\n3.1.2 Continuous fire mode (holding ZR)\n\n\n3.2 Version history\n3.3 Quotes\n3.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n3.5 Gallery\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n3.1.1 Burst fire mode (pressing ZR)\n3.1.2 Continuous fire mode (holding ZR)\n\n- 3.1.1 Burst fire mode (pressing ZR)\n\n- 3.1.2 Continuous fire mode (holding ZR)\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 3.5 Gallery\n\n- 4 Strategy\n\n- 5 Trivia\n\n- 6 Names in other languages\n\n- 7 References\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n2.1.1 Burst fire mode (pressing ZR)\n2.1.2 Continuous fire mode (holding ZR)\n\n- 2.1.1 Burst fire mode (pressing ZR)\n\n- 2.1.2 Continuous fire mode (holding ZR)\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 2.1.1 Burst fire mode (pressing ZR)\n\n- 2.1.2 Continuous fire mode (holding ZR)\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n3.1.1 Burst fire mode (pressing ZR)\n3.1.2 Continuous fire mode (holding ZR)\n\n- 3.1.1 Burst fire mode (pressing ZR)\n\n- 3.1.2 Continuous fire mode (holding ZR)\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 3.5 Gallery\n\n- 3.1.1 Burst fire mode (pressing ZR)\n\n- 3.1.2 Continuous fire mode (holding ZR)\n\nThe Squeezer is a champagne bottle turned sideways. The bottle has a wooden handle and a metal trigger near the bottom, and most of the bottle is wrapped in red and white foil. Going around the middle of the bottle and over the cork are some metal attachments likely designed to keep the cork in place.\n\nThe Squeezer was announced as a part of version 2.0.0 and released on 22 December 2017 at  02:00 UTC.[1] It comes with Splash Wall and Sting Ray.\n\nIt appears in three Octo Expansion stations:\n\n- F01E12 Drop the Bass Station\n\n- F07C12 Matchmaker Station\n\n- J02 Matchmaster Station\n\n- The Squeezer is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 200.

The outer reticle does not expand after jumping.\n\n- Shots initially travel straight at a rate of 32 units per frame for 4 frames. Shots travel straight for 128 distance units.\nAfter that, the shot's velocity is set to 29.695 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and decreases further as it travels.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 29.695 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and decreases further as it travels.\n\n- Ink droplets occur every 150 units.\n\n- The frequency at which ink drips from a shot occurs at a rate of 1.5 droplets per shot.\n\n- There are a total of 8 different droplet patterns that can be created while firing this weapon.\n\n- Droplets that occur within 5 units of the player have a radius of 22 units, and a width of 12.5 units.\nThese droplets have their radius multiplied by a value ranging from 1.2 if they fell from a height above 100 units to 1.4 if they fell from a height below 30 units.\n\n- These droplets have their radius multiplied by a value ranging from 1.2 if they fell from a height above 100 units to 1.4 if they fell from a height below 30 units.\n\n- Droplets that occur when they travel past 200 units of the player have a radius of 15 units.\n\n- All other ink droplets have a radius of 11.8 units.\n\n- Droplets that are far from the player and all other droplets have their radius multiplied by a value ranging from 1 if they fell from a height above 100 units to 1.2 if they fell from a height below 30 units.\n\n- If no ink droplets have occurred within 5 units of the player for 4 shots, the next shot the player makes will force a paint droplet to appear at the player's feet.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 29.695 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and decreases further as it travels.\n\n- These droplets have their radius multiplied by a value ranging from 1.2 if they fell from a height above 100 units to 1.4 if they fell from a height below 30 units.\n\n- The ink consumption of 1.08% and ink tank capacity of 100% allows players to fire 92 shots before needing to refill the ink supply.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- The interval between firing and when the player is able to enter swim form or use a sub weapon is 3 frames.\n\n- When firing continuously, it shoots a bullet every 7 frames (8.57 shots per second).\n\n- Each shot has a base damage of 30.\n\n- If a shot is in the air for more than 7 frames after being fired, it loses 0.9375 damage per frame until it reaches 15 damage at frame 23.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while on the ground is 8 degrees.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while in the air is 13 degrees.\n\n- The outer reticle immediately expands after jumping. After 25 frames, the outer reticle will start shrinking, and will finish shrinking after 70 frames.\n\n- The Squeezer starts off having a 1% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle.\nThis chance increases by 1% per shot, and maximizes at a 25% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 24 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- This chance increases by 1% per shot, and maximizes at a 25% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 24 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- When jumping, the chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle is immediately set to 40%.\n\n- Accuracy starts recovering 7 frames after the player stops shooting. The chance to shoot towards the outer reticle decreases by 0.5% per frame, if the chance is not already at the minimum, meaning that it takes 55 frames to reach maximum accuracy. (85 after shooting while jumping.)\n\n- Shots initially travel straight at a rate of 24 units per frame for 3 frames.

Squeezing  once will squirt out a single high-power ink shot! But you can also hold down  to fire continuously, allowing you to ink the turf around you in a hurry! Press  repeatedly when fighting to maximize your damage output, and hold  when inking turf for maximum ink coverage! You can set up a Splash Wall to protect your team, and put far-off foes on notice with the Sting Ray special!\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- Additional promotional image\n\n- An Inkling girl holding the Squeezer.\n\n- An Inkling girl firing the Squeezer.\n\nSqueezer returns in Splatoon 3 with Splash Walls and the Trizooka for its kit.\n\nIt appears in two missions in Return of the Mammalians:\n\n- 0306 Time Trial and Errors\n\n- 0405 Amusing a Bemused Muse\n\n- The Squeezer is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 20.

Pull the trigger once, and you get a single high-powered shot. But holding down  changes everything! Suddenly the rate of fire goes up, and the Squeezer transforms into an absolute turf-inking machine. Master both modes, and you'll barely even need the Splash Wall to shore up your defenses. But it's there for you anyway! And with a Trizooka to tame far-off enemies, this set is built for flashy fighters who are comfortable being the center of attention.\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Squeezer.\n\nFor competitive tips about the Squeezer\n\n- The Squeezer is designed after a champagne bottle in both look and function, with the first powerful shot being similar to a popping cork and the following weaker stream emulating the foam spilling out afterwards."
