    "The Hero Blaster Replica is identical in appearance to the Hero Blaster. It is mainly black with some blue dots on the front part instead of flames.",
    "The Hero Blaster Replica is visually identical to the Level 1 Hero Blaster, but is simply a re-skinned Blaster. Therefore unlike the switchable sub weapons of the Hero Blaster, it comes with Toxic Mist and Splashdown. To unlock the Hero Blaster Replica, the player must complete every level with the Hero Blaster in Octo Canyon, in which it becomes available for purchase at Ammo Knights.",
