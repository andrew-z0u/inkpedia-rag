    "The Splattershot is a main weapon in the Splatoon series, created by the weapon brand Splat. It is an iconic weapon, commonly seen in promotional material and as part of multiple amiibo.",
    "The Splattershot resembles a toy water gun.",
    "In Splatoon, the grip and stock are both yellow-green, while the muzzle and forestock being a dark green. The muzzle is surrounded by a red-orange ring, and is shaped like a cone. On the top of the weapon is an ink tank in the shape of a capsule that changes color depending on the player's ink. The tank is connected to the stock by a yellow-green ring that goes down the middle of the tank, as well as by a red-orange tube at the back of the weapon.",
    "In Splatoon 2, the Splattershot received a new design that vastly differs from its Splatoon counterpart. The grip and stock are both purple, while the forestock and muzzle are a dark green. The muzzle is shaped like a cone, as well. On top of the weapon is an ink tank in the shape of a capsule that changes color depending on the player's ink. On the upper part of the end of the ink tank is a pink cap reminiscent of the caps used to fill a water gun. The ink tank is connected to the stock by a pink, diagonal facing ring that goes down the middle and back of the tank. On the bottom of the grip is what appears to be a magazine, colored dark green.",
    "In Splatoon 3, the Splattershot again has an updated design. The grip and stock are both purple, while the muzzle and forestock are both yellow. The muzzle is shaped like a cone, as well. On top of the weapon is an ink tank in the shape of a capsule that changes color depending on the player's ink. The tank is connected to the stock by a wavy yellow piece holder that juts out at the end of the tank. Also at the end of the tank is a blue, cone-shaped cap reminiscent of the caps used to fill a water gun.",
    "The Splattershot is an all-around weapon in terms of power, range, and rate of fire, making it easy to use for players of all levels of experience. It has a simplistic colorful look, similar to real life children's water guns. When utilized, it sprays a steady splattering of ink until the player's ink tank is depleted. It comes in a set with Burst Bombs and the Bomb Rush.",

    "The Splattershot appears as Inkling's neutral special and in a few normals in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, alongside a variety of other weapons that they use in their attacks.",
    "For their neutral special, they shoot projectiles with the Splattershot at the opponent to deal damage. This also coats opponents in ink but does not ink the ground. The projectiles will decrease in range as the Inkling runs low on ink, and the Splattershot will not fire if the Inkling is out of ink. Similarly, for their rapid jab, the Inkling shoots the Splattershot, creating spurts at the muzzle which damages and inks opponents. This move also stops functioning when out of ink. For their forward throw, the Inkling fires a single shot directly into the opponent, covering them slightly and using a small amount of ink. In their other normals, they physically swing and hit opponents with the Splattershot itself. These moves do not cost ink.",
    "- The Hero Shot, a modified version of the Splattershot, is the default weapon in Octo Valley and the Inkling Squid amiibo challenges, one of the nine hero weapons in Octo Canyon, and a selectable weapon in Return of the Mammalians. However, it cannot be used anywhere else.",
    "- The Splattershot was the first playable main weapon, available in the E3 2014 Splatoon demo. At that time it was called the \"Ink Shot\".[7]\nFurthermore, its sub weapon was the Splat Bomb and its special weapon was the Inkzooka. No weapon in the Splattershot series has this combination, with the Tentatek Splattershot and Wasabi Splattershot using the beta special and sub weapons respectively. This combination later appeared on the Octobrush Nouveau, Soda Slosher, and Sploosh-o-matic 7. In addition, the Splat Bomb with a similar special appeared on the Tentatek Splattershot in Splatoon 2.\nIt was also the first main weapon to be revealed to the public in the history of the Splatoon series.",
    "- In Splatoon and Splatoon 2, the Splattershot has the most variants out of all main weapons, with a total of five in both games.",
    "- In Splatoon 2, the Splattershot's model from the first game can still be seen when using the original Inkling Girl and Inkling Boy amiibo.",
    "- In the Splatoon 2 Switch event demo and Splatoon 2 Global Testfire, the Splattershot had the Tenta Missiles; in the final game, it instead has the Splashdown. The sub weapon remained as Burst Bombs. The beta combination was given to the Splat Dualies, Hero Dualie Replicas, Mini Splatling, and Grim Range Blaster, and the Tenta Missiles appear on the Kensa Splattershot.",
    "- In the Splatoon manga bonus chapter \"Splattershot Jr.\", the character Splattershot Jr. wins a Golden Splattershot with the help of Team Blue.",
    "- The Splatoon version of the Splattershot appears in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe in several of the Inkling Girl's and Inkling Boy's animations, namely the animations for being chosen on the character select screen, doing tricks off ramps, and finishing a race or battle in the top-half positions.",
    "- The Splattershot appears to be loosely based on the Super Soaker 50, the first super soaker and one of the most influential water guns- though due to common nature of water guns, it is not possible to determine reliably.",
    "- Prior to Chill Season 2022 in Splatoon 3, the Splattershot was originally the only main weapon in the game to have an alternate variant, being the Hero Shot Replica.",
    "- This is one of the weapons available to use in the Splatoon 3 Splatfest World Premiere.",
    "- The Splatoon 3 Splattershot is the first weapon in the series to have two reskins, the Hero Shot Replica and the Order Shot Replica.",
    "- In the European French localization of Splatoon 3, Sheldon's introduction mistakenly says that it comes with Splat Bomb instead of Suction Bomb."
