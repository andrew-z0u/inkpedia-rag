The nozzle is orange and bears the Forge logo. The trigger is also orange.\n\nNearly identical to the Splattershot Pro, the Forge Splattershot Pro is an advanced weapon in terms of power and fire rate, making it easy to use for more experienced players.

It's the Forge Splattershot Pro!\nIts stats haven't changed, but the Point Sensor and Inkzooka open up new tactical potential!\nLike the Splattershot Pro, it's not the easiest weapon to handle, so try it out if you've got what it takes!\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- An image of a male Inkling with a Forge Splattershot Pro\n\n- Another image of the Inkling wielding a Forge Splattershot Pro\n\n- Official art of an Inkling holding the Forge Splattershot Pro\n\n- SplatNet icon\n\nThe Forge Splattershot Pro was released on 2 September 2017 at 02:00 UTC.[2]\n\nThe Forge Splattershot Pro makes use of the same main weapon as Splattershot Pro: it is a long-range, high damage shooter with high ink consumption. It comes with the Suction Bomb and Bubble Blower.\n\n- The Forge Splattershot Pro is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 170. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The ink consumption of 2% and ink tank capacity of 100% allows players to fire 50 shots before needing to refill the ink supply.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- When initially firing the weapon in humanoid form, the first shot takes 3 frames to come out.\n\n- When firing from swim form, the first shot takes 11 frames to come out.\n\n- The interval between firing and when the player is able to enter swim form or use a sub weapon is 4 frames.\n\n- When firing continuously, it shoots a bullet every 8 frames (7.5 shots per second).\n\n- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.55 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 20 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Each shot has a base damage of 42.\n\n- If a shot is in the air for more than 7 frames after being fired, it loses 1.3125 damage per frame until it reaches 21 damage at frame 23.\n\n- The bullet hitbox has a radius of 2 units.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while on the ground is 2.7 degrees.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while in the air is 6 degrees.\n\n- The outer reticle immediately expands after jumping. After 25 frames, the outer reticle will start shrinking, and will finish shrinking after 70 frames.\n\n- The Forge Splattershot Pro starts off having a 1% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle.\nThis chance increases by 1% per shot, and maximizes at a 25% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 24 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- This chance increases by 1% per shot, and maximizes at a 25% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 24 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- When jumping, the chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle is immediately set to 40%.\n\n- Accuracy starts recovering 8 frames after the player stops shooting.

weapon.\n\n- Droplets that occur within 11 units of the player have a radius of 18 units, and a width of 8 units.\nThese droplets have their radius multiplied by a value ranging from 1.2 if they fell from a height above 100 units to 1.4 if they fell from a height below 30 units.\n\n- These droplets have their radius multiplied by a value ranging from 1.2 if they fell from a height above 100 units to 1.4 if they fell from a height below 30 units.\n\n- Droplets that occur when they travel past 200 units of the player have a radius of 16 units.\n\n- All other ink droplets have a radius of 12.5

weapon set put together by the gear brand Forge! The main weapon functions identically to the Splattershot Pro, but you can keep opponents at arm's length with Suction Bombs! And the Bubble Blower special is the perfect complement to the main weapon's long range! It's not the easiest set to use, but if you master it, you'll be unstoppable!\n\n- SplatoonJP promotional render\n\n- Nintendo of America promotional render\n\n- Shooting ink\n\n- Holding the Forge Splattershot Pro\n\n- Inkling boy with the Forge Splattershot Pro\n\nThe Forge Splattershot Pro returns in Splatoon 3 with Suction Bombs and the Booyah Bomb in its kit.

(86 after shooting while jumping.)\n\n- Shots initially travel straight at a rate of 3.833333 units per frame for 3 frames. Shots travel straight for 11.499999 distance units.\nAfter that, the shot's velocity is set to 2.2698 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 2.2698 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight).

It's a mouthful, but when this set is firing on all cylinders, it does the talking for you. The main weapon is functionally identical to the base Splattershot Pro, but a Suction Bomb a day keeps the enemies away! Or, well, as many Suction Bombs as you can muster. And while the Booyah Bomb special might feel like too many bombs, when you get a chance to drop one, you'll realize that there's no such thing as too many bombs! This set isn't necessarily balanced for a beginner, but if you can handle it, few opponents will be able to handle YOU!\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Forge Splattershot Pro.\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Forge_Splattershot_Pro.mp4\n\n\nModel of the Forge Splattershot Pro rotating (link to file)\n\nFor competitive tips about the Forge Splattershot Pro\n\n- In Splatoon 2, the Forge Splattershot Pro was the first weapon to debut the Bubble Blower special weapon.\n\n- The Forge Splattershot Pro is the only weapon released by Forge.\n\n- Across all three games, the Forge Splattershot Pro is unlocked at level 20.

It has the Forge brand name as a prefix to differentiate it from the Splattershot Pro. It also denotes that the weapon is a collaboration with Forge.\n\nIts Japanese name, プライムシューターコラボ puraimu shūtā korabo, means \"Prime Shooter Collab\". The abbreviated suffix Collab denotes it is a collaboration. However, unlike the English name, it doesn't specify the brand Forge."
