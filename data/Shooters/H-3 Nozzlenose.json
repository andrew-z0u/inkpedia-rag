    "The H-3 Nozzlenose is a main weapon in the Splatoon series, manufactured by the \"D\" brand. It is an atypical, burst-fire shooter with which the player must repeatedly press  to fire, with each trigger pull resulting in a volley of three shots. It forms part of a pair with the similar but less heavy-duty L-3 Nozzlenose.",
    "As one of only two shooters in the series with no capacity for automatic fire, the H-3 Nozzlenose presents very uniquely. While all three shots within a burst are fired very fast, firing another burst has a delay that can range from slight to rather notable if the player times their button presses incorrectly.",
    "However, its shots are notably damaging enough for one burst to be able to splat an opponent if all three shots connect, making it the sole shooter capable of doing so with a single tap of  (if not counting the categorization of blasters as shooters prior to Splatoon 3). Additionally, beginning in Splatoon 2, a special hit effect occurs when all three shots from a single trigger pull hit one enemy, playing a unique sound effect accompanied by a visible flash.",
    "Overall, the H-3 Nozzlenose is a weapon that combines the aesthetics of a revolver with garden tools. Accordingly, it possesses some of the hallmarks of a traditional handgun, including a hammer and iron sights. However, in place of a firing chamber, it instead possesses a length of garden hose housed in a reel. The front of the reel also features a rod that appears to double as the end of the reel's spool and an analog to the extractor rod found on fixed-cylinder revolvers (this resemblance is notably even more pronounced compared to its lighter relative, the L-3 Nozzlenose). The barrel is also replaced by an extended metal piping, capped with a spray nozzle. The overall frame of the weapon is black, while the nozzle head and reel are blue. The hose is translucent and changes color to match the user's ink color.",
    "In Splatoon 3, the H-3 Nozzlenose received a redesign, with the previous simple metal piping being swapped for a pressure valve lever and a new nozzle head with a black rim. The hose contained within the weapon now has a blue stripe and has a faint cyan hue with certain ink colors, and the handle now has a blue grip.",
    "The H-3 Nozzlenose was released on 12 September 2015 at 02:00 UTC.[1] It comes with the Suction Bombs and Echolocator.",

    "- In Splatoon, Sheldon states that the H-3 and L-3 Nozzlenoses are semiautomatic; however, if this were true, they would only fire one shot per trigger pull instead of three. The weapons are actually burst-fire, which is seen as an intermediary step between semi- and fully-automatic fire.\nFurther, the heavy visual inspiration from revolvers also makes this choice somewhat confusing, as while semi-automatic revolvers are a proven (albeit unpopular) concept, a burst-fire revolver does not exist in the real world.",
    "- Beginning in Splatoon 3, the H-3 Nozzlenose shares its special full burst effects with the Tri-Stringer, the REEF-LUX 450, and the Wellstring V.",
    "- The Tableturf Battle card for the H-3 Nozzlenose depicts an Inkling or Octoling wearing the Wooden Sandals, which had not yet returned from Splatoon 2 at the time of that card's release.",
    "The H in the name means \"heavy\" (as directly confirmed by Sheldon's description in Splatoon and Splatoon 3; some other translations also explicitly name it as such), as this weapon is physically larger, slower, and more powerful, making it the \"heavier\" of the two Nozzlenoses. Sheldon also humorously suggests in Splatoon 3 that he chooses to interpret the H as standing for \"HAHAHAHA\", the boisterous laughter of the wielder. 3 is the number of shots fired by each burst.",
    "Nozzlenose refers to the spray nozzle that serves as the weapon's barrel; it may also be a play on \"bottlenose\", as in the bottlenose dolphins, referring to its manufacturer's dolphin sticker design (the weapon's Dutch name also contains a similar dolphin-based reference)."
