  "content": "The H-3 Nozzlenose is a main weapon in the Splatoon series, manufactured by the \"D\" brand. It is an atypical, burst-fire shooter with which the player must repeatedly press  to fire, with each trigger pull resulting in a volley of three shots. It forms part of a pair with the similar but less heavy-duty L-3 Nozzlenose.\n\n- 1 Description\n\n- 2 Appearance\n\n- 3 Splatoon\n\n3.1 Data\n3.2 Version history\n3.3 Quotes\n3.4 Gallery\n3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 4 Splatoon 2\n\n4.1 Data\n4.2 Version history\n4.3 Quotes\n4.4 Gallery\n4.5 Demonstration\n\n- 4.1 Data\n\n- 4.2 Version history\n\n- 4.3 Quotes\n\n- 4.4 Gallery\n\n- 4.5 Demonstration\n\n- 5 Splatoon 3\n\n5.1 Data\n5.2 Version history\n5.3 Quotes\n5.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n5.5 Gallery\n\n- 5.1 Data\n\n- 5.2 Version history\n\n- 5.3 Quotes\n\n- 5.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 5.5 Gallery\n\n- 6 Trivia\n\n- 7 Etymology\n\n7.1 Names in other languages\n7.2 Translation notes\n\n- 7.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 7.2 Translation notes\n\n- 8 References\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 4.1 Data\n\n- 4.2 Version history\n\n- 4.3 Quotes\n\n- 4.4 Gallery\n\n- 4.5 Demonstration\n\n- 5.1 Data\n\n- 5.2 Version history\n\n- 5.3 Quotes\n\n- 5.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 5.5 Gallery\n\n- 7.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 7.2 Translation notes\n\nAs one of only two shooters in the series with no capacity for automatic fire, the H-3 Nozzlenose presents very uniquely. While all three shots within a burst are fired very fast, firing another burst has a delay that can range from slight to rather notable if the player times their button presses incorrectly.\n\nHowever, its shots are notably damaging enough for one burst to be able to splat an opponent if all three shots connect, making it the sole shooter capable of doing so with a single tap of  (if not counting the categorization of blasters as shooters prior to Splatoon 3). Additionally, beginning in Splatoon 2, a special hit effect occurs when all three shots from a single trigger pull hit one enemy, playing a unique sound effect accompanied by a visible flash.\n\nOverall, the H-3 Nozzlenose is a weapon that combines the aesthetics of a revolver with garden tools. Accordingly, it possesses some of the hallmarks of a traditional handgun, including a hammer and iron sights. However, in place of a firing chamber, it instead possesses a length of garden hose housed in a reel. The front of the reel also features a rod that appears to double as the end of the reel's spool and an analog to the extractor rod found on fixed-cylinder revolvers (this resemblance is notably even more pronounced compared to its lighter relative, the L-3 Nozzlenose). The barrel is also replaced by an extended metal piping, capped with a spray nozzle. The overall frame of the weapon is black, while the nozzle head and reel are blue. The hose is translucent and changes color to match the user's ink color.\n\nIn Splatoon 3, the H-3 Nozzlenose received a redesign, with the previous simple metal piping being swapped for a pressure valve lever and a new nozzle head with a black rim. The hose contained within the weapon now has a blue stripe and has a faint cyan hue with certain ink colors, and the handle now has a blue grip.\n\nThe H-3 Nozzlenose was released on 12 September 2015 at 02:00 UTC.[1] It comes with the Suction Bombs and Echolocator.\n\n- The H-3 Nozzlenose is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- Each shot consumes 1.6% of the ink tank capacity.\nThis allows players to fire 62 shots before needing to refill the ink supply.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This allows players to fire 62 shots before needing to refill the ink supply.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- When pressing , three shots will be fired at a time, as long as there is enough ink to fire all three.\nIf there is not enough ink to fire all three shots, then zero, one or two shots will be fired instead, depending on how much ink is left in the ink tank.\n\n- If there is not enough ink to fire all three shots, then zero, one or two shots will be fired instead, depending on how much ink is left in the ink tank.\n\n- When firing a burst, a shot is fired every 5 frames.\n\n- After the last shot in a burst is fired, another burst cannot be fired for 20 frames.\n\n- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.45 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 30 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Each shot has a base damage of 41.\n\n- Shots travel straight for 6 frames.

The H stands for \"heavy\"! It can't fire as rapidly, but you can pinpoint foes with the Echolocator to make every shot count! Suction Bombs can also make an effective defense, so this set is a good choice for well-rounded fighters!(NA)\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- An Inkling boy running with the H-3 Nozzlenose equipped.\n\n- Firing the H-3 Nozzlenose.

The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The ink consumption of 2.25% and ink tank capacity of 100% allows players to fire 44 shots before needing to refill the ink supply.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- When initially firing the weapon in humanoid form, the first shot takes 3 frames to come out.\n\n- When firing from swim form, the first shot takes 12 frames to come out.\n\n- When pressing , three shots will be fired at a time, as long as there is enough ink to fire all three.\nIf there is not enough ink to fire all three shots, then zero, one or two shots will be fired instead, depending on how much ink is left in the ink tank.\n\n- If there is not enough ink to fire all three shots, then zero, one or two shots will be fired instead, depending on how much ink is left in the ink tank.\n\n- When firing a burst, a shot is fired every 5 frames.\n\n- After the last shot in a burst is fired, another burst cannot be fired for 20 frames.\n\n- When a burst is started, it takes 35 frames before the user can enter swim form or use their sub weapon.\n\n- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.6 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 25 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Each shot has a base damage of 41.\n\n- If a shot is in the air for more than 8 frames after being fired, it loses 1.28125 damage per frame until it reaches 20.5 damage at frame 24.\n\n- The bullet hitbox has a radius of 2 units.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while on the ground is 1 degrees.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while in the air is 1 degrees.\n\n- The outer reticle immediately expands after jumping. After 20 frames, the outer reticle will start shrinking, and will finish shrinking after 50 frames.\n\n- The H-3 Nozzlenose starts off having a 1% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle.\nThis chance increases by 1% per shot, and maximizes at a 25% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 24 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- This chance increases by 1% per shot, and maximizes at a 25% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 24 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- When jumping, the chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle is immediately set to 40%.\n\n- Accuracy starts recovering 5 frames after the player stops shooting. The chance to shoot towards the outer reticle decreases by 0.5% per frame, if the chance is not already at the minimum, meaning that it takes 53 frames to reach maximum accuracy. (83 after shooting while jumping.)\n\n- Shots initially travel straight at a rate of 28.75 units per frame for 4 frames. Shots travel straight for 115 distance units.\nAfter that, the shot's velocity is set to 22.698 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and decreases further as it travels.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 22.698 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and decreases further as it travels.\n\n- Ink droplets occur every 60 units.\n\n- The frequency at which ink drips from a shot occurs at a rate of 3 droplets per shot.\n\n- There are a total of 5 different droplet patterns that can be created while firing this weapon.\n\n- Droplets that occur within 11 units of the player have a radius of 21 units, and a width of 13.5 units.\nThese droplets have their radius multiplied by a value ranging from 1.2 if they fell from a height above 100 units to 1.4 if they fell from a height below 30 units.\n\n- These droplets have their radius multiplied by a value ranging from 1.2 if they fell from a height above 100 units to 1.4 if they fell from a height below 30 units.\n\n- Droplets that occur when they travel past 200 units of the player have a radius of 21 units.\n\n- All other ink droplets have a radius of 14.2 units.\n\n- Droplets that are far from the player and all other droplets have their radius multiplied by a value ranging from 1 if they fell from a height above 100 units to 1.2 if they fell from a height below 30 units.\n\n- If no ink droplets have occurred within 11 units of the player for 3 shots, the next shot the player makes will force a paint droplet to appear at the player's feet. This ensures that firing a single burst will always paint the player's feet, so long as they have enough ink to fire all 3 shots.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- If there is not enough ink to fire all three shots, then zero, one or two shots will be fired instead, depending on how much ink is left in the ink tank.\n\n- This chance increases by 1% per shot, and maximizes

You can use the Tenta Missiles to check and mark an opponent's location. I recommend this set for the Inkling who wants to bring out the best in their main weapon.\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- An Octoling boy with the H-3 Nozzlenose\n\nThe H-3 Nozzlenose returns in Splatoon 3.

The \"H\" probably stands for \"heavy,\" but I like to think it stands for \"HAHAHAHA,\" which is the noise one typically makes while firing it. Now, the fire rate suffers a bit compared to lighter weapons, but when you can pinpoint your enemies with a Point Sensor, you can make each shot count. And with a team all juiced up on energy from your Tacticooler, you're ready to laugh all the way to the winner's circle.\n\n- The middle right Octoling is wielding the H-3 Nozzlenose.\n\n- Cropped version of the aforementioned image to only feature the Octoling wielding the H-3 Nozzlenose.\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- Held by the Inkling on the right.\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the H-3 Nozzlenose.\n\n- In Splatoon, Sheldon states that the H-3 and L-3 Nozzlenoses are semiautomatic; however, if this were true, they would only fire one shot per trigger pull instead of three. The weapons are actually burst-fire, which is seen as an intermediary step between semi- and fully-automatic fire.\nFurther, the heavy visual inspiration from revolvers also makes this choice somewhat confusing, as while semi-automatic revolvers are a proven (albeit unpopular) concept, a burst-fire revolver does not exist in the real world.\n\n- Further, the heavy visual inspiration from revolvers also makes this choice somewhat confusing, as while semi-automatic revolvers are a proven (albeit unpopular) concept, a burst-fire revolver does not exist in the real world.\n\n- Beginning in Splatoon 3, the H-3 Nozzlenose shares its special full burst effects with the Tri-Stringer, the REEF-LUX 450, and the Wellstring V.\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card for the H-3 Nozzlenose depicts an Inkling or Octoling wearing the Wooden Sandals, which had not yet returned from Splatoon 2 at the time of that card's release.\n\n- Further, the heavy visual inspiration from revolvers also makes this choice somewhat confusing, as while semi-automatic revolvers are a proven (albeit unpopular) concept, a burst-fire revolver does not exist in the real world.\n\nThe H in the name means \"heavy\" (as directly confirmed by Sheldon's description in Splatoon and Splatoon 3; some other translations also explicitly name it as such), as this weapon is physically larger, slower, and more powerful, making it the \"heavier\" of the two Nozzlenoses. Sheldon also humorously suggests in Splatoon 3 that he chooses to interpret the H as standing for \"HAHAHAHA\", the boisterous laughter of the wielder. 3 is the number of shots fired by each burst.\n\nNozzlenose refers to the spray nozzle that serves as the weapon's barrel; it may also be a play on \"bottlenose\", as in the bottlenose dolphins, referring to its manufacturer's dolphin sticker design (the weapon's Dutch name also contains a similar dolphin-based reference)."
