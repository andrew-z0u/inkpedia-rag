    "- Before being officially announced, the Clash Blaster Neo appeared in the Splatoon 2 version 3.0 preview section of the Nintendo Direct on 8 March 2018.[6]\nIt was shown to come with Burst Bombs and Tenta Missiles. However, later datamining and the final release have shown the weapon to come with Curling Bombs, in contradiction to the video.",
    "- In Splatoon 2, the Clash Blaster Neo is one of the only three weapons to be unlocked simultaneously with its alternate kit, the Clash Blaster. The other pairs are the H-3 Nozzlenose D and Cherry H-3 Nozzlenose, and the E-liter 4K Scope and Custom E-liter 4K Scope. It however remains as the only completely unique weapon.\nThis is due to the Clash Blaster being unlocked at Level 30, which is the highest level for unlocking weapons.\nThis is no longer true in Splatoon 3, since the Clash Blaster Neo is unlocked three levels after the Clash Blaster."
