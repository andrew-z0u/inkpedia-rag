    "The .52 Gal is a main weapon in the Splatoon series, created by the weapon brand Deco.",
    "A member of the shooter class, this weapon distinguishes itself by outputting enough ink in each shot to splat opponents in two hits, while still having a decent fire rate. The weapon's fire rate is lesser than the Splattershot Pro and greater than the .96 Gal. Its only major drawback is its poor accuracy and turf covering ability; many shots deviate far enough to the left or right that they miss the target. The .52 Gal and its close relative the .96 Gal share their visual design and high-damage, low-accuracy performance.",
    "The .52 is designed resembling a revolver-type grenade launcher, with a water cooler bottle as a base, taking the role of the weapon's chamber (or, in this case, ink tank). A grip, sight, and high-caliber gun barrel are clamped to the bottle. The parts surrounding the bottle are black plastic with pink accents, while the bottle matches the player's ink color. The sights are large and rectangular, and the barrel is black with pink polka-dot indents. The frame of the weapon is shaped slightly differently in Splatoon 3, and the stock is tilted downwards.",
    "When the .52 fires, it emits ripples in the air from its barrel, and produces a deep booming sound.",
    "This weapon is notably very similar in appearance to the .96 Gal, the main difference being that the .52 has a shorter barrel, and in Splatoon 3 the .96 has a differently designed barrel, muzzle, sights, and underside of its frame.",
    "The .52 Gal comes in a set with the Splash Wall and Killer Wail.",
    "[1]",
    "The .52 Gal is a heavy hitter with an extra large nozzle for shooting massive amounts of ink!\nIt's powerful, but pretty slow. If you find yourself in trouble, throw up a Splash Wall and retreat! The Killer Wail can be used offensively or defensively, so it's good for fighters who can read the flow of battle!(NA)",
    "The main weapon .52 Gal is a Shooter with an extra-large nozzle for shooting massive quantities of ink.\nSo it's powerful, but not so great at rapid fire. If you get in trouble, throw up a Splash Wall and retreat! The Killer Wail can be used offensively or defensively, so it's good for fighters who can read the flow of battle!(EU/OC)",
    "The .52 Gal returns in Splatoon 2, with an identical appearance but slightly changed performance. It comes with Point Sensor and Baller.",
    "It appears in one Octo Expansion station:",
    "[2][3]",
    "The .52 Gal is a heavy hitter with an extra-large nozzle for shooting massive amounts of ink. It's powerful but slow, making it important to be aware of your surroundings. Lucky for you, it comes with the Point Sensor sub! The included Baller is great for drawing attention, so I recommend this set to players who like to control the flow of battle!",
    "The .52 Gal returns in Splatoon 3 with a slightly updated design. Its kit consists of Splash Wall and Killer Wail 5.1, referencing its original kit in Splatoon.",
    "It appears in one mission in Return of the Mammalians:",
    "[4]",
    "The .52 Gal is a heavy hitter with an extra-large nozzle for shooting massive amounts of ink. Of course, all that power comes at the expense of fire rate... which is why you'll want the Splash Wall to hide behind while reloading. And if the other team is playing it a little too safe, you've always got the Killer Wail 5.1. Lock on and blast 'em with lasers! So if you're the type to hang back and wait for just the right moment, this loadout is for you.",
    "For competitive tips about the .52 Gal",
    ".52 Gal is short for .52 Gallon. \"Gal\" is also a play on Cal, the short form of Caliber, a term commonly used when describing the diameter of bullets for firearms.",
    ".52ガロン .52 Garon has the same origin as the English name, but without Gallon shortened to Gal.",
