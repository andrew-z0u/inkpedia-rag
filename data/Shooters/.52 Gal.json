  "content": "The .52 Gal is a main weapon in the Splatoon series, created by the weapon brand Deco.\n\nA member of the shooter class, this weapon distinguishes itself by outputting enough ink in each shot to splat opponents in two hits, while still having a decent fire rate. The weapon's fire rate is lesser than the Splattershot Pro and greater than the .96 Gal. Its only major drawback is its poor accuracy and turf covering ability; many shots deviate far enough to the left or right that they miss the target. The .52 Gal and its close relative the .96 Gal share their visual design and high-damage, low-accuracy performance.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Splatoon\n\n2.1 Data\n2.2 Version history\n2.3 Quotes\n2.4 Gallery\n2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3 Splatoon 2\n\n3.1 Data\n3.2 Version history\n3.3 Quotes\n3.4 Gallery\n3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 4 Splatoon 3\n\n4.1 Data\n4.2 Version history\n4.3 Quotes\n4.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n4.5 Gallery\n\n- 4.1 Data\n\n- 4.2 Version history\n\n- 4.3 Quotes\n\n- 4.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 4.5 Gallery\n\n- 5 Strategy\n\n- 6 Trivia\n\n- 7 Etymology\n\n7.1 Names in other languages\n7.2 Translation notes\n7.3 Internal names\n\n- 7.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 7.2 Translation notes\n\n- 7.3 Internal names\n\n- 8 References\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 4.1 Data\n\n- 4.2 Version history\n\n- 4.3 Quotes\n\n- 4.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 4.5 Gallery\n\n- 7.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 7.2 Translation notes\n\n- 7.3 Internal names\n\nThe .52 is designed resembling a revolver-type grenade launcher, with a water cooler bottle as a base, taking the role of the weapon's chamber (or, in this case, ink tank). A grip, sight, and high-caliber gun barrel are clamped to the bottle. The parts surrounding the bottle are black plastic with pink accents, while the bottle matches the player's ink color. The sights are large and rectangular, and the barrel is black with pink polka-dot indents. The frame of the weapon is shaped slightly differently in Splatoon 3, and the stock is tilted downwards.\n\nWhen the .52 fires, it emits ripples in the air from its barrel, and produces a deep booming sound.\n\nThis weapon is notably very similar in appearance to the .96 Gal, the main difference being that the .52 has a shorter barrel, and in Splatoon 3 the .96 has a differently designed barrel, muzzle, sights, and underside of its frame.\n\nThe .52 Gal comes in a set with the Splash Wall and Killer Wail.\n\n- The .52 Gal is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- Each shot consumes 1.2% of the ink tank capacity.\nThis allows players to fire 83 shots before needing to refill the ink supply.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This allows players to fire 83 shots before needing to refill the ink supply.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- When firing continuously, it shoots a bullet every 9 frames (6.67 shots per second).\n\n- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.6 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 20 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Each shot has a base damage of 52.\n\n- Shots travel straight for 4 frames. After that, they may lose damage. A shot will lose damage until it reaches 26 damage at frame 15.\n\n- Shots have a radius of 2 units.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while on the ground is 6 degrees.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while in the air is 15 degrees.\n\n- The outer reticle immediately expands after jumping. The outer reticle will finish shrinking after 60 frames.\n\n- The chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle increases by 12% per shot, and maximizes at a 25% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle.\nThis means that it takes 3 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- This means that it takes 3 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- When jumping, the chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle is immediately set to 40%.\n\n- Accuracy starts recovering 9 frames after the player stops shooting.\n\n- Shots initially travel straight at a rate of 22 units per frame for 4 frames.

The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The ink consumption of 1.3% and ink tank capacity of 100% allows players to fire 76 shots before needing to refill the ink supply.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- When initially firing the weapon in humanoid form, the first shot takes 3 frames to come out.\n\n- When firing from swim form, the first shot takes 11 frames to come out.\n\n- The interval between firing and when the player is able to enter swim form or use a sub weapon is 3 frames.\n\n- When firing continuously, it shoots a bullet every 9 frames (6.67 shots per second).\n\n- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.6 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 20 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Each shot has a base damage of 52.\n\n- If a shot is in the air for more than 11 frames after being fired, it loses 1.375 damage per frame until it reaches 30 damage at frame 27.\n\n- The bullet hitbox has a radius of 2 units.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while on the ground is 6 degrees.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while in the air is 12 degrees.\n\n- The outer reticle immediately expands after jumping. After 25 frames, the outer reticle will start shrinking, and will finish shrinking after 70 frames.\n\n- The .52 Gal starts off having a 2% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle.\nThis chance increases by 3% per shot, and maximizes at a 25% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 8 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- This chance increases by 3% per shot, and maximizes at a 25% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 8 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- When jumping, the chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle is immediately set to 40%.\n\n- Accuracy starts recovering 9 frames after the player stops shooting. The chance to shoot towards the outer reticle decreases by 1.5% per frame, if the chance is not already at the minimum, meaning that it takes 25 frames to reach maximum accuracy. (35 after shooting while jumping.)\n\n- Shots initially travel straight at a rate of 22 units per frame for 4 frames. Shots travel straight for 88 distance units.\nAfter that, the shot's velocity is set to 18.472 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and decreases further as it

amounts of ink. It's powerful but slow, making it important to be aware of your surroundings. Lucky for you, it comes with the Point Sensor sub! The included Baller is great for drawing attention, so I recommend this set to players who like to control the flow of battle!\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- An Octoling boy wielding a .52 Gal.\n\nThe .52 Gal returns in Splatoon 3 with a slightly updated design.

Of course, all that power comes at the expense of fire rate... which is why you'll want the Splash Wall to hide behind while reloading. And if the other team is playing it a little too safe, you've always got the Killer Wail 5.1. Lock on and blast 'em with lasers! So if you're the type to hang back and wait for just the right moment, this loadout is for you.\n\n- An Octoling holding the .52 Gal.\n\n- The bottom left Inkling wields the .52 Gal.\n\n- Early 2D icon\n\n- Current 2D icon\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the .52 Gal.\n\n- Unused early version of the .52 Gal's Tableturf Battle card.

The .96 Gal's damage per shot is not 96, however.\n\n- The .52 Gal was originally called the \"5.2 Gallon\" and came with the Inkstrike instead of the Killer Wail. This can be seen in an image from before Splatoon's release. The Inkstrike was later given to its alternate kit, the .52 Gal Deco.\n\n- The .52 Gal was one of the weapons that was available to use in the Splatoon 3 Splatfest World Premiere.\n\n- In the Splash Wall trial for Judd's Trial, the player is equipped with the .52 Gal.\n\n- The .52 Gal also happens to be the main weapon of Aloha, a member of the S4 in the Splatoon manga.\n\n.52 Gal is short for .52 Gallon. \"Gal\" is also a play on Cal, the short form of Caliber, a term commonly used when describing the diameter of bullets for firearms.\n\n.52ガロン .52 Garon has the same origin as the English name, but without Gallon shortened to Gal."
