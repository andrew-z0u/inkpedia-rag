    "The .52 Gal is a main weapon in the Splatoon series, created by the weapon brand Deco.",
    "A member of the shooter class, this weapon distinguishes itself by outputting enough ink in each shot to splat opponents in two hits, while still having a decent fire rate. The weapon's fire rate is lesser than the Splattershot Pro and greater than the .96 Gal. Its only major drawback is its poor accuracy and turf covering ability; many shots deviate far enough to the left or right that they miss the target. The .52 Gal and its close relative the .96 Gal share their visual design and high-damage, low-accuracy performance.",
    "The .52 is designed resembling a revolver-type grenade launcher, with a water cooler bottle as a base, taking the role of the weapon's chamber (or, in this case, ink tank). A grip, sight, and high-caliber gun barrel are clamped to the bottle. The parts surrounding the bottle are black plastic with pink accents, while the bottle matches the player's ink color. The sights are large and rectangular, and the barrel is black with pink polka-dot indents. The frame of the weapon is shaped slightly differently in Splatoon 3, and the stock is tilted downwards.",
    "When the .52 fires, it emits ripples in the air from its barrel, and produces a deep booming sound.",
    "This weapon is notably very similar in appearance to the .96 Gal, the main difference being that the .52 has a shorter barrel, and in Splatoon 3 the .96 has a differently designed barrel, muzzle, sights, and underside of its frame.",
    "The .52 Gal comes in a set with the Splash Wall and Killer Wail.",

    "- The .52 Gal was originally called the \"5.2 Gallon\" and came with the Inkstrike instead of the Killer Wail. This can be seen in an image from before Splatoon's release. The Inkstrike was later given to its alternate kit, the .52 Gal Deco.",

    ".52ガロン .52 Garon has the same origin as the English name, but without Gallon shortened to Gal."
