    "The Glitterz L-3 Nozzlenose is a main weapon in Splatoon 3, and is the Emberz-branded version of the L-3 Nozzlenose. It was added as part of the Splatlands Collection on 12 June 2025.",
    "The Glitterz L-3 Nozzlenose has a similar apperence to the L-3 Nozzlenose but with a noticeable color change. The barrel and the nozzle have changed to a seafoam green and the build around it has changed to a light gray. The hose has changed to a light magenta. An Emberz badge is also added to the side.",
    "The Glitterz L-3 Nozzlenose comes with Splat Bomb and Inkjet.",

    "The Glitterz L-3 Nozzlenose from Emberz is a luxurious weapon for those who like the finer things in lifeâ€”like firing three times at once. Of course, the weapon's glitzy design is part of that luxury selling point, but I'd be remiss not to mention the excellent Splat Bomb and Inkjet loadout. It's superbly balanced. I hope you'll give this set a try if you want to master a fancy but fickle main weapon and make your mark!",
