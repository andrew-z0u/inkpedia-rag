    "The Rapid Blaster is a main weapon in the Splatoon series, manufactured by Deco.",
    "The Rapid Blaster is a shooter in Splatoon and Splatoon 2, and a blaster in Splatoon 3, that is similar to the Blaster, but fires much faster and has greater range. However, this comes at the cost of less ink coverage, a smaller blast radius, and weaker shots. At minimum, it takes one direct hit and one indirect hit to splat an opponent with this weapon. Its close relative, the Rapid Blaster Pro, has slightly longer range and a slightly slower fire rate. The fire rate is faster than that of the Luna Blaster, and slower than that of the Clash Blaster.",
    "The Rapid Blaster is mainly gray with a black handle. Multiple red panels are located on the top and sides. The tip of the barrel, which is connected to the body with a small black tube, is orange.",
    "The Rapid Blaster comes with Ink Mines and Bubbler. Each shot consumes 8% of the ink tank capacity, and the ink tank recovers 1.67% of its capacity between each shot, allowing the player to fire 15 shots before needing to refill the tank.",

Each shot consumes 7% of the ink tank capacity, allowing the player to fire 14 shots before needing to refill the tank.",

    "For competitive tips about the Rapid Blaster",
    "- This weapon resembles a toy dart blaster.",
    "- Despite being called the Rapid Blaster, the fire rate of this blaster is slower than the Clash Blaster's, though the Clash Blaster was introduced later.",
    "- The orange cap on the tip of the Rapid Blaster's barrel in Splatoon 3 resembles those seen on toy dart blasters in the United States, which requires toy firearms to be painted partially or completely in safety orange to avoid confusion with real guns. This cap is also seen on the Rapid Blaster Pro.",
    "- Prior to version 3.0.0 of Splatoon 3, the colored parts on the 2D icons for the Rapid Blaster and the Rapid Blaster Pro were colored yellow. This was corrected to the white color upon release of the update.",
    "- In the Italian localization of Splatoon 2, Sheldon's introduction about the Rapid Blaster says that it comes with Point Sensor instead of Ink Mine.",
    "- In Splatoon 3, parts of the weapon that match the user's ink color light up when fired.\nFor some reason, these light-up parts of the Rapid Blaster variant, the Rapid Blaster Deco, do not light up when fired. This issue is shared with the Rapid Blaster Pro Deco."
