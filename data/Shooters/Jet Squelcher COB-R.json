However, parts of the weapon that are colored dark blue are now sporting a light brown scale pattern, referencing a cobra which the weapon is named after.\n\nThe Jet Squelcher COB-R makes its first appearance in Splatoon 3 with identical stats to the Jet Squelcher.\n\n- The Jet Squelcher COB-R is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 22.5. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The ink consumption is 1.6% per shot, allowing the user to fire for about 8.27 seconds on a full ink tank.\n\n- When firing continuously, it shoots a bullet every 8 frames (7.5 shots per second).\n\n- When firing from humanoid form, the first shot takes 3 frames to come out. When firing from swim form, the first shot takes 11 frames to come out.\n\n- The interval between firing the weapon and being able to enter swim form or use a sub weapon is 4 frames.\n\n- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.06 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 20 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Each shot has a base damage of 32 and minimum damage of 16.\n\n- If a shot is in the air for more than 9 frames after being fired, it will lose about 1 damage every frame until it reaches 16 damage at frame 25.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with players has a radius of 0.2 units.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with the environment has a radius of 0.2 units.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while on the ground is 2.5 degrees.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while in the air is 8 degrees.\n\n- The outer reticle immediately expands after jumping. After 25 frames, the outer reticle will start shrinking, and will finish shrinking after 70 frames.\n\n- The weapon starts off having a 2% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle.\nThis chance increases by 1.5% per shot, and maximizes at a 25% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 16 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- This chance increases by 1.5% per shot, and maximizes at a 25% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 16 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- When jumping, the chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle is immediately set to 40%.\n\n- Accuracy starts recovering 8 frames after the player stops shooting. The chance to shoot towards the outer reticle decreases by 1% per frame, if the chance is not already at the minimum, meaning that it takes 31 frames to reach maximum accuracy. (46 after shooting while jumping.)\n\n- Shots initially travel straight at a rate of 3.36 units per frame for 5 frames. Shots travel straight for 16.8 distance units.\nAfter that, the shot's velocity is set to 2.232 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 2.232 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- The effective range is about 20.3 units.\nThis number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n- This number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n- This chance increases by 1.5% per shot, and maximizes at a 25% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 16 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 2.232 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight).

How about the Jet Squelcher COB-R! Developed by Barazushi, this Squelcher is both scaly and scary. Now, being a Squelcher, this weapon's bark is louder than its bite, so to speak. But having Burst Bombs as your sub more than makes up for it. And if you can charge up a special, there's nothing quite like the Triple Splashdown to shake things up. Try this set if you fight at a distance but can also strike from the front.\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- Promotional image of the Splatlands Collection - Barazushi weapons\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Jet_Squelcher_COB-R_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nPromotional video (link to file)\n\nThe suffix \"COB-R\" is a stylized spelling of the word cobra, regarding the weapon's snake skin-like texture."
