The front of the funnel, the nozzle, the edges of the trapezoidal prisms, and the trigger side of the handhold are white. The body has a sticker of black Toni Kensa logo with cartoon eyes, similar to the Custom Splattershot Jr.'s star sticker, and Kensa's signature red clothespin is clasped onto the back of the cap.\n\nThe Kensa Splattershot Jr. and its variants also replace the user's standard ink tank with the one resembling baby bottles. It has a rounded rectangular shape and a round cap. For the Kensa Splattershot Jr., a black tag with the aforementioned black Toni Kensa logo with cartoon eyes is attached around the bottle's neck.\n\nThe Kensa Splattershot Jr. is part of the third Kensa Collection, which was released as part of version 4.2.0 on 7 November 2018 at 02:00 UTC[1]. It comes with Torpedoes and the Bubble Blower, as well as a larger ink tank with 10% more capacity – just like its variants, the Splattershot Jr. and the Custom Splattershot Jr. – making it even more ink efficient.\n\n- The Kensa Splattershot Jr. is a lightweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 110. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The ink consumption of 0.43% and ink tank capacity of 110% allows players to fire 255 shots before needing to refill the ink supply.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- When initially firing the weapon in humanoid form, the first shot takes 3 frames to come out.\n\n- When firing from swim form, the first shot takes 10 frames to come out.\n\n- The interval between firing and when the player is able to enter swim form or use a sub weapon is 2 frames.\n\n- When firing continuously, it shoots a bullet every 5 frames (12 shots per second).\n\n- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.72 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 15 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Each shot has a base damage of 28.\n\n- If a shot is in the air for more than 8 frames after being fired, it loses 0.875 damage per frame until it reaches 14 damage at frame 24.\n\n- The bullet hitbox has a radius of 2 units.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while on the ground is 12 degrees.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while in the air is 15 degrees.\n\n- The outer reticle immediately expands after jumping. After 25 frames, the outer reticle will start shrinking, and will finish shrinking after 70 frames.\n\n- The Kensa Splattershot Jr. starts off having a 4% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle.\nThis chance increases by 2% per shot, and maximizes at a 40% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 18 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- This chance increases by 2% per shot, and maximizes at a 40% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 18 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- When jumping, the chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle is immediately set to 40%.\n\n- Accuracy starts recovering 5 frames after the player stops shooting. The chance to shoot towards the outer reticle decreases by 1% per frame, if the chance is not already at the minimum, meaning that it takes 41 frames to reach maximum accuracy.\n\n- Shots initially travel straight at a rate of 22 units per frame for 3 frames. Shots travel straight for 66 distance units.\nAfter that, the shot's velocity is set to 18.945 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and decreases further as it travels.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 18.945 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and decreases further as it travels.\n\n- Ink droplets occur every 95 units.\n\n- The frequency at which ink drips from a shot occurs at a rate of 1.4 droplets per shot.\n\n- There are a total of 7 different droplet patterns that can be created while firing this weapon.\n\n- Droplets that occur within 11 units of the player have a radius of 19.7 units, and a width of 12 units.\nThese droplets have their radius multiplied by a value ranging from 1.2 if they fell from a height above 100 units to 1.4 if they fell from a height below 30 units.\n\n- These droplets have their radius multiplied by a value ranging from 1.2 if they fell from a height above 100 units to 1.4 if they fell from a height below 30 units.\n\n- Droplets that occur when they travel past 200 units of the player have a radius of 16.5 units.\n\n- All other ink droplets have a radius of 12.9 units.\n\n- Droplets that are far from the player and all other droplets have their radius multiplied by a value ranging from 1 if they fell from a height above 100 units to 1.2 if they fell from a height below 30 units.\n\n- If no ink droplets have occurred within 11 units of the player for 3 shots, the next shot the player makes will force a paint droplet to appear at the player's feet.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This chance increases by 2% per shot, and maximizes at a 40% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 18 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 18.945 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and decreases further as it travels.\n\n- These droplets have their radius multiplied by a value ranging from 1.2 if they fell from a height above 100 units to 1.4 if they fell from a height below 30 units.\n\n[2][3]\n\n- ▼ Points to fill special gauge: 190 → 200\n\n- When using the Kensa Splattershot Jr., the sticker on the player's ink tank was previously the same as the one when using the Splattershot Jr., but is now unique.\n\n- ▲ Reduced the time to shoot from squid form by 2/60 of a second.\n\n- ▲ Reduced the time to begin recovering ink after shooting by 5/60 of a second.\n\n- Fixed an issue causing the ink tank strap to not properly reflect the player's team color when using the Kensa Splattershot Jr.\n\n- ▲ Ink consumption: 0.5 → 0.43\n\n- ▲ Increased damage dealt to the umbrella portion of the following weapons by roughly 57%.\n Tenta Brella\n Tenta Sorella Brella\n Tenta Camo Brella\n\n- Tenta Brella\n\n- Tenta Sorella Brella\n\n- Tenta Camo Brella\n\n- Tenta Brella\n\n- Tenta Sorella Brella\n\n- Tenta Camo Brella\n\n- ▲ Increased damage dealt to the Booyah Bomb armor by roughly 17%.\n\n- ▲ Points to fill special gauge: 200 → 190.\n\nThe Kensa Splattershot Jr. is a limited edition version of the Splattershot Jr. created in collaboration with Toni Kensa!Draw your opponents' attention with the Torpedo sub, then close the distance and pounce while they're distracted!Once you've secured your home turf, use the Bubble Blower special to bounce into enemy territory in a flash!There's nothing \"junior\" about a player who can use all three aspects of this dynamic weapon set!\n\n- Promotional render\n\n- An Octoling boy (second to right) with the Kensa Splattershot Jr.\n\nFor competitive tips about the Kensa Splattershot Jr.\n\n- In Splatoon 2, the Splattershot Jr. family of weapons are the only weapons in the game with a different design, higher capacity Ink Tank."
