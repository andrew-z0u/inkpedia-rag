    "The Kensa Splattershot Jr. is a main weapon in Splatoon 2. It is a Toni Kensa-branded variant of the Splattershot Jr..",
    "The Kensa Splattershot Jr. is an almost completely black variant of the Splattershot Jr.. The front of the funnel, the nozzle, the edges of the trapezoidal prisms, and the trigger side of the handhold are white. The body has a sticker of black Toni Kensa logo with cartoon eyes, similar to the Custom Splattershot Jr.'s star sticker, and Kensa's signature red clothespin is clasped onto the back of the cap.",
    "The Kensa Splattershot Jr. and its variants also replace the user's standard ink tank with the one resembling baby bottles. It has a rounded rectangular shape and a round cap. For the Kensa Splattershot Jr., a black tag with the aforementioned black Toni Kensa logo with cartoon eyes is attached around the bottle's neck.",
    "The Kensa Splattershot Jr. is part of the third Kensa Collection, which was released as part of version 4.2.0 on 7 November 2018 at 02:00 UTC[1]. It comes with Torpedoes and the Bubble Blower, as well as a larger ink tank with 10% more capacity – just like its variants, the Splattershot Jr. and the Custom Splattershot Jr. – making it even more ink efficient.",
