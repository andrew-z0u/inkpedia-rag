    "The Kensa Luna Blaster shares its overall design with the Luna Blaster. However, the back half of the blaster and the large ball attachment on the front are black, while the front half of the blaster and the smaller ball attachment at the back are white. The Neo logo on the back half of the blaster is replaced by some text that straddles the two halves. The text on the front half is black, while the text on the back half is white. The first letter of the text resembles the Toni Kensa logo. The signature Toni Kensa red clothespin is attached to the stick of the large ball attachment.",
