But you know that's not all... it also has a fancy-schmancy new loadout! Including Burst Bombs to weaken foes a bit before finishing 'em off with your main weapon. And the special? None other than the Ultra Stamp, guaranteed to send anyone in your path running for cover. Don't underestimate the amount of ink you can fling with this setup, but it is a quirky combo.
