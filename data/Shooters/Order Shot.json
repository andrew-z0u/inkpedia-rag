Its appearance is similar to that of a Splattershot. When firing, ring-shaped holograms manifest around the nozzle of the Shooter.\n\nThe Order Shot is a weapon unlocked in Side Order, and is part of Agent 4's Palette. Its base set consists of Splat Bombs and Trizooka. However, this can be changed in the Spire of Order by using a vending machine.\n\nIt has lower stats in comparison to the Splattershot, with a slower fire rate, damage, strafe speed, ink efficiency, and range. However, this can be upgraded through color chips in the Spire of Order.\n\n- The clear screen for the Order Shot\n\n- The fail screen for the Order Shot"
