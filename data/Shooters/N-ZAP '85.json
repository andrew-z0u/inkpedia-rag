  "content": "The N-ZAP '85 is a main weapon in the Splatoon series, created by the weapon brand Nintendo (not to be confused with the company).\n\nIt has a high fire rate and takes four hits to splat an opponent. It highly resembles the original North American NES Zapper, an accessory for the Nintendo Entertainment System released in 1985, hence its name.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Splatoon\n\n2.1 Data\n2.2 Version history\n2.3 Quotes\n2.4 Gallery\n2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3 Splatoon 2\n\n3.1 Data\n3.2 Version history\n3.3 Quotes\n3.4 Gallery\n3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 4 Splatoon 3\n\n4.1 Data\n4.2 Version history\n4.3 Quotes\n4.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n4.5 Gallery\n\n- 4.1 Data\n\n- 4.2 Version history\n\n- 4.3 Quotes\n\n- 4.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 4.5 Gallery\n\n- 5 Strategy\n\n- 6 Trivia\n\n- 7 Etymology\n\n7.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 7.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 8 References\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 4.1 Data\n\n- 4.2 Version history\n\n- 4.3 Quotes\n\n- 4.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 4.5 Gallery\n\n- 7.1 Names in other languages\n\nThe N-ZAP '85 consists of a mid-length gray barrel connected to a gray handhold with a white body. The sides of the body have the Nintendo logo printed in red, with one side also having the word \"Zapper\" and a copyright for the year 1985 printed. Notably, this text is all in English lettering, rather than the Inkling language, as it matches the decals of the real world NES Zapper exactly. Attached to the weapon's handhold is a red trigger.\n\nThe N-ZAP '85 was the first weapon to be added post-release. It was released on 2 June 2015 at 02:00 UTC,[1] alongside the stage Port Mackerel and Ranked Battles. It is weaker than the Splattershot but it makes up for it with a higher fire rate.

Its attack power isn't all that, but it's fabulous at quickly charging up the Echolocator special weapon. Combined with Splat Bombs, this set caters to fighters who like to cover a lot of ground in battle!(NA)\n\nThe N-ZAP '85 is a Shooter that boasts incredible ink efficiency and rapid-firing capability!
