    "The Blaster is a main weapon in the Splatoon series, created by Custom. As its name suggests, it is a \"blaster\", a type of weapon that fires ink rounds that explode shortly after.",
    "When pressing , the weapon shoots special ink rounds that burst like fireworks after traveling a certain distance. These bursts can deal damage in a wide area, allowing its user to attack opponents hiding behind obstacles and around corners. The explosive round does enough damage to splat opponents with only one direct hit or two indirect hits. Its fire rate is faster than that of the Range Blaster, and slower than that of the Luna Blaster.",
    "The Blaster's appearance is based on the idea of a \"hot rod\", or custom, car. The rear of the weapon is a spray can, the kind of spray can that would be used to custom-paint a car. The middle of the weapon exposes the internals of the weapon as if to make it easier for the owner to tweak and maintain any custom parts inside. The exposed spring resembles the coil springs in car suspensions. The front of the weapon features a flame design characteristic of custom-painted cars, which is painted on an object that resembles a muffler.",
    "As of Splatoon 3, the front of the weapon also features a handle, resembling ones seen on paint cans. Plus, the weapon has new animations: a lever on the left that pulls downwards, as well as the spring located in the center of the weapon that \"throws\" the front part of the weapon forward. These two animations occur with every shot.",
    "The Blaster comes in a set with the Disruptors and Killer Wail. The weapon consumes 8% of the ink tank's capacity with each shot, and the ink tank refills 1.67% of its capacity between each shot, allowing for 15 shots to be fired before needing to refill on ink.",

    "For competitive tips about the Blaster",
    "The Blaster appears as Inkling's up smash attack in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, alongside a variety of other weapons that Inkling uses in their attacks.",
    "When attacking, Inkling charges up their attack and fires the Blaster upwards to deal damage to opponents above them. This attack has a large radius, much like the blaster in the Splatoon franchise, and can sometimes deal damage to opponents around Inkling if they're close enough. This also coats opponents in ink, as do most of Inkling's attacks, but does not ink the ground. It deals much lower damage if Inkling is out of ink.",
    "- Concept art for the Blaster reveals that the rear of the weapon was originally designed after a gumball machine or gachapon.[7]",
    "- The Blaster was one of the weapons that were available to use in the Splatoon 3 Splatfest World Premiere.",
    "- When doing the blaster and Autobomb trials in Judd's trials, the player has the Blaster.",
    "- The Blaster is the only weapon to have an unlockable replica from Octo Canyon, that being the Hero Blaster Replica, but to not have an equivalent in Side Order. In this case, the Order Blaster Replica in Splatoon 3 is based on the Luna Blaster."
