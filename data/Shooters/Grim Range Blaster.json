    "The Grim Range Blaster is a main weapon in Splatoon and Splatoon 2. It is a Sheldon's Picks-branded variant of the Range Blaster and comes with a different sub and special.",
    "The Grim Range Blaster shares its overall design with the Range Blaster. However, the flames on the front are green, and the spray can attached to the back does not change color to match the user's ink.",
    "The Grim Range Blaster is one of the nine weapons included in Sheldon's Picks Vol. 2 and was released on 8 June 2016.\nAs its name implies, is a variation of a regular Blaster with shots that travel farther before exploding. As a tradeoff, this blaster has a lower rate of fire. It comes with the Burst Bomb and Killer Wail.",

    "The Grim Range Blaster is a Range Blaster pushed to its limits. It's \"totally metal\", or so I'm assured. The black and green flame design is for squids who want their look to be as aggressive as their weapon. The Main works just like a Range Blaster, but the new Burst Bombs really amp up the splat speed of this set. The impressive range of the Killer Wail also adds a lot. Try this set out if you think you have a good feel for the range of a Blaster type weapon!(NA/EU/OC)",
    "The Grim Range Blaster was released on 3 April 2019 at 01:00 UTC as part of the 4.6.0 version release.[3]. It comes with Burst Bomb and Tenta Missiles.",
    "[4][5]",
    "The Grim Range Blaster is a main weapon with an aggressive design: just look at those green flames on that black background! Once you've reduced an enemy's health with the blaster, toss out a Burst Bomb to finish them off in a snap! Or sow chaos with the Tenta Missiles, then finish the job with the blaster while your enemy tries to evade the missiles! This set is waiting for someone with a burning passion to ignite the battlefield in an infernal whirlwind of nonstop pressure!",
