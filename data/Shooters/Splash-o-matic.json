The marker changes color to match the user's ink. The Splash-o-matic has what appears to be a pressure sensor near the nozzle, and flanking the nozzle is a pair of levers with black handles. On the back of the Splash-o-matic is a small black attachment that supports a lever. The rings on the attachment and the lever also change color to match the user's ink. Attached to the marker are the handle and trigger.\n\nThe Splash-o-matic was released in Splatoon on 13 June 2015 at 02:00 UTC.[1]\n\n- The Splash-o-matic is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- Each shot consumes 0.7% of the ink tank capacity.\nThis allows players to fire 142 shots before needing to refill the ink supply.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This allows players to fire 142 shots before needing to refill the ink supply.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- When firing continuously, it shoots a bullet every 5 frames (12 shots per second).\n\n- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.72 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 20 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Each shot has a base damage of 28.\n\n- Shots travel straight for 3 frames.

The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The ink consumption is 0.8% per shot, allowing the user to fire for about 10.42 seconds on a full ink tank.\n\n- When firing continuously, it shoots a bullet every 5 frames (12 shots per second).\n\n- When firing from humanoid form, the first shot takes 3 frames to come out. When firing from swim form, the first shot takes 11 frames to come out.\n\n- The interval between firing the weapon and being able to enter swim form or use a sub weapon is 3 frames.\n\n- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.072 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 20 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Each shot has a base damage of 28 and minimum damage of 14.\n\n- If a shot is in the air for more than 4 frames after being fired, it will lose about 0.88 damage every frame until it reaches 14 damage at frame 20.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with players has a radius of 0.2 units.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with the environment has a radius of 0.2 units.\n\n- Shots cannot ever deviate from the inner reticle while on the ground.\n\n- Shots cannot ever deviate from the inner reticle while in the air. The outer reticle does not expand after jumping.\n\n- Shots initially travel straight at a rate of 4.0376 units per frame for 2 frames. Shots travel straight for 8.0752 distance units.\nAfter that, the shot's velocity is set to 1.6289 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 1.6289 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight).

It may not have the ink spread or raw power of some weapons, but it more than makes up for it with rapid fire that is quite rapid indeed. Plus, when you can pin down an enemy with Burst Bombs, you don't need as much power. Simply splatter them at your leisure while they're mired in your ink. And with the Crab Tank special your back pocket, nothing can stand in your way! Try not to laugh maniacally as you overpower the other team time and again.\n\n- The second Inkling is holding the Splash-o-matic.\n\n- Promotional image of an Inkling holding the Splash-o-matic.\n\n- The Splash-o-matic with the Zipcaster.\n\n- 2D icon before version 3.0.0.\n\n- 2D icon after version 3.0.0.\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Splash-o-matic.\n\n- An Inkling holding the Splash-o-matic as of Fresh Season 2023, showing its new design.\n\nFor competitive tips about the Splash-o-matic\n\n- In the Octo Expansion, the Splash-o-matic does not have perfect firing accuracy when jumping. This is because Version 3.2.0, the version that gave the Splash-o-matic perfect accuracy when jumping, was released after the expansion and was not applied to it; Nintendo generally does not apply post-release weapon balance updates to single-player modes.\n\n- In Splatoon 3, the icons for the Splash-o-matic were made darker in version 3.0.0, probably to make it more uniform with the Neo Splash-o-matic's icons.\n\n- During the September 2021 Nintendo Direct, its set was shown to be the Burst Bomb and the Zipcaster. However, this was changed to Burst Bomb and Crab Tank. Its beta set ended up being given to the Splatana Stamper.\n\nSplash-o-matic is derived from Splash and Automatic. The -o-matic suffix is also a common, cliché naming convention for technological gadgets.\n\nシャープマーカー Shāpu mākā (\"Sharp Marker\") references the pen-based appearance of the Splash-o-matic. The name is also to contrast it with the Sploosh-o-matic. The highly accurate Splash-o-matic is named after a sharp marker pen, while the Sploosh-o-matic with its wide, cone-shaped muzzle is more akin to a bold marker pen."
