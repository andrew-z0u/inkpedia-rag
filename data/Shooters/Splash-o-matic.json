    "The Splash-o-matic is a main weapon in the Splatoon series, made by the weapon brand Neo.",
    "It is a short-range, high-accuracy shooter with a fire rate equal to that of the Splattershot Jr.",
    "The Splash-o-matic, similarly to its cousin the Sploosh-o-matic, seems to be a marker or pen inside a metal frame. The marker changes color to match the user's ink. The Splash-o-matic has what appears to be a pressure sensor near the nozzle, and flanking the nozzle is a pair of levers with black handles. On the back of the Splash-o-matic is a small black attachment that supports a lever. The rings on the attachment and the lever also change color to match the user's ink. Attached to the marker are the handle and trigger.",

    "For competitive tips about the Splash-o-matic",
    "- In the Octo Expansion, the Splash-o-matic does not have perfect firing accuracy when jumping. This is because Version 3.2.0, the version that gave the Splash-o-matic perfect accuracy when jumping, was released after the expansion and was not applied to it; Nintendo generally does not apply post-release weapon balance updates to single-player modes.",
    "- In Splatoon 3, the icons for the Splash-o-matic were made darker in version 3.0.0, probably to make it more uniform with the Neo Splash-o-matic's icons.",
    "- During the September 2021 Nintendo Direct, its set was shown to be the Burst Bomb and the Zipcaster. However, this was changed to Burst Bomb and Crab Tank. Its beta set ended up being given to the Splatana Stamper.",
    "Splash-o-matic is derived from Splash and Automatic. The -o-matic suffix is also a common, cliché naming convention for technological gadgets.",
    "シャープマーカー Shāpu mākā (\"Sharp Marker\") references the pen-based appearance of the Splash-o-matic. The name is also to contrast it with the Sploosh-o-matic. The highly accurate Splash-o-matic is named after a sharp marker pen, while the Sploosh-o-matic with its wide, cone-shaped muzzle is more akin to a bold marker pen."
