    "Well, well! The makers of the Splash-o-matic keep making more splashes in the weapon-development space! And, well, more Splash-o-matics.\nThis one boasts \"improved texture\" and \"high-quality paint.\" At least, according to the marketing materials I received from Barazushi.\nOh, and it's called the Splash-o-matic GCK-O! Sorry, I've been trying to reduce the number of times I say \"Splash-o-matic,\" but I do need to say the full name at least once.\nI'd be remiss not to say Toxic Mist and Ink Storm as well, since those are the sub and special that come with this kit.\nUsed in conjunction, those can slow opponents to a crawl, leaving you free to pick them off with your high-precision main weapon...that shall not be named again.",
    "The suffix \"GCK-O\" is a stylized spelling of the word gecko.",
