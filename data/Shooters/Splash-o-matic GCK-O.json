However, parts of the weapon that are colored dull bronze are now dark brown, and it has a lamp attached on top. The Barazushi logo can be seen of the side of the weapon.\n\nThe Splash-o-matic GCK-O makes its first appearance in Splatoon 3 as part of the Splatlands Collection. Its kit consists of Toxic Mist and Ink Storm.\n\n- The Splash-o-matic GCK-O is a lightweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 11.7. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The ink consumption is 0.8% per shot, allowing the user to fire for about 10.42 seconds on a full ink tank.\n\n- When firing continuously, it shoots a bullet every 5 frames (12 shots per second).\n\n- When firing from humanoid form, the first shot takes 3 frames to come out. When firing from swim form, the first shot takes 11 frames to come out.\n\n- The interval between firing the weapon and being able to enter swim form or use a sub weapon is 3 frames.\n\n- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.072 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 20 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Each shot has a base damage of 28 and minimum damage of 14.\n\n- If a shot is in the air for more than 4 frames after being fired, it will lose about 0.88 damage every frame until it reaches 14 damage at frame 20.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with players has a radius of 0.2 units.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with the environment has a radius of 0.2 units.\n\n- Shots cannot ever deviate from the inner reticle while on the ground.\n\n- Shots cannot ever deviate from the inner reticle while in the air. The outer reticle does not expand after jumping.\n\n- Shots initially travel straight at a rate of 4.0376 units per frame for 2 frames. Shots travel straight for 8.0752 distance units.\nAfter that, the shot's velocity is set to 1.6289 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 1.6289 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- The effective range is about 9.98 units.\nThis number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n- This number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 1.6289 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- This number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n[1]\n\n- ▲ Increased the speed of shots by approximately 3% and extended the flight distance.\nInitial velocity: 3.92 units/frame → 4.0376 units/frame.\nVelocity after 2 frames: 1.5815 units/frame → 1.6289 units/frame.\n\n- Initial velocity: 3.92 units/frame → 4.0376 units/frame.\n\n- Velocity after 2 frames: 1.5815 units/frame → 1.6289 units/frame.\n\n- ▼ Decreased the radius inked by spray droplets created by shots by approximately 3%.\n\n- Initial velocity: 3.92 units/frame → 4.0376 units/frame.\n\n- Velocity after 2 frames: 1.5815 units/frame → 1.6289 units/frame.\n\nWell, well! The makers of the Splash-o-matic keep making more splashes in the weapon-development space! And, well, more Splash-o-matics.\nThis one boasts \"improved texture\" and \"high-quality paint.\" At least, according to the marketing materials I received from Barazushi.\nOh, and it's called the Splash-o-matic GCK-O! Sorry, I've been trying to reduce the number of times I say \"Splash-o-matic,\" but I do need to say the full name at least once.\nI'd be remiss not to say Toxic Mist and Ink Storm as well, since those are the sub and special that come with this kit.\nUsed in conjunction, those can slow opponents to a crawl, leaving you free to pick them off with your high-precision main weapon...that shall not be named again.\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- Promotional image of the Splatlands Collection - Barazushi weapons\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Splash-o-Matic_GCK-O_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nPromotional video (link to file)\n\nThe suffix \"GCK-O\" is a stylized spelling of the word gecko."
