    "The Dual Squelcher is a main weapon in Splatoon, created by Custom. In Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3, it was converted into Dualie Squelchers.",
    "It is similar to the Jet Squelcher, but has a higher fire rate at the cost of range and power. The fire rate is faster than the Splattershot Pro and slower than the Splash-o-matic.",
    "The Dual Squelcher is similar in appearance to the Jet Squelcher. However, the Dual Squelcher is red and has a second barrel attached to the bottom. This barrel is nonfunctional in-game.",
    "The Dual Squelcher comes in a set with Splat Bomb and Echolocator.",

    "- Not counting the transition from E-liter 3K to E-liter 4K, the Dual Squelcher is the only main weapon to not return in Splatoon 2. Instead, it was mechanically changed and converted into the Dualie Squelchers.",
    "- The Dual Squelcher only fires through the top barrel. The bottom barrel is simply cosmetic.",
    "- There is an unused model and weapon parameters for the Dual Squelcher in Splatoon 2, but it was replaced by the Dualie Squelchers.",
    "- The Splattershot Nova, a new main weapon in Splatoon 3, is statistically similar to the Dual Squelcher. Both weapons have long range and a faster firing rate than the Splattershot Pro, but weaker damage. They also share the code name of \"QuickLong\"."
