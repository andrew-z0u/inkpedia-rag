  "content": "The Dual Squelcher is a main weapon in Splatoon, created by Custom. In Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3, it was converted into Dualie Squelchers.\n\nIt is similar to the Jet Squelcher, but has a higher fire rate at the cost of range and power. The fire rate is faster than the Splattershot Pro and slower than the Splash-o-matic.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Splatoon\n\n2.1 Data\n2.2 Version history\n2.3 Quotes\n2.4 Gallery\n2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3 Trivia\n\n- 4 Names in other languages\n\n- 5 References\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\nThe Dual Squelcher is similar in appearance to the Jet Squelcher. However, the Dual Squelcher is red and has a second barrel attached to the bottom. This barrel is nonfunctional in-game.\n\nThe Dual Squelcher comes in a set with Splat Bomb and Echolocator.\n\n- The Dual Squelcher is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- Each shot consumes 1.2% of the ink tank capacity.\nThis allows players to fire 83 shots before needing to refill the ink supply.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This allows players to fire 83 shots before needing to refill the ink supply.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- When firing continuously, it shoots a bullet every 6 frames (10 shots per second).\n\n- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.6 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 20 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Each shot has a base damage of 28.\n\n- Shots travel straight for 6 frames. After that, they may lose damage. A shot will lose damage until it reaches 14 damage at frame 18.\n\n- Shots have a radius of 2 units.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while on the ground is 4 degrees.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while in the air is 12 degrees.\n\n- The outer reticle immediately expands after jumping. The outer reticle will finish shrinking after 60 frames.\n\n- The chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle increases by 2% per shot, and maximizes at a 25% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle.\nThis means that it takes 13 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- This means that it takes 13 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- When jumping, the chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle is immediately set to 40%.\n\n- Accuracy starts recovering 6 frames after the player stops shooting.\n\n- Shots initially travel straight at a rate of 22 units per frame for 6 frames. Shots travel straight for 132 distance units.\n\n- Ink droplets occur every 105 units.\n\n- The frequency at which ink drips from a shot occurs at a rate of 2 droplets per shot.\n\n- There are a total of 8 different droplet patterns that can be created while firing this weapon.\n\n- Droplets that occur within 11 units of the player have a radius of 21 units.\n\n- Droplets that occur when they travel past 200 units of the player have a radius of 18.5 units.\n\n- All other ink droplets have a radius of 13 units.\n\n- This allows players to fire 83 shots before needing to refill the ink supply.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This means that it takes 13 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n[1]\n\n- ▲ Walk speed while firing increased by 20%.\n\n- ▲ Special gauge loss: 50% → 40%.\n\nThe Dual Squelcher adds a manifold mechanism to the Jet Squelcher for extreme range and firing rate. Claim turf, fire out those Echolocators, and then attack the opponents' position with Splat Bombs! So I'd recommend it if those kinds of tricksy tactics happen to be your style!\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- An image of an Inkling boy with a Dual Squelcher.\n\n- Another image of the Inkling wielding a Dual Squelcher.\n\n- Official art of an Inkling holding the Dual Squelcher.\n\n- SplatNet icon\n\n- Not counting the transition from E-liter 3K to E-liter 4K, the Dual Squelcher is the only main weapon to not return in Splatoon 2. Instead, it was mechanically changed and converted into the Dualie Squelchers.\n\n- The Dual Squelcher only fires through the top barrel. The bottom barrel is simply cosmetic.\n\n- There is an unused model and weapon parameters for the Dual Squelcher in Splatoon 2, but it was replaced by the Dualie Squelchers.\n\n- The Splattershot Nova, a new main weapon in Splatoon 3, is statistically similar to the Dual Squelcher. Both weapons have long range and a faster firing rate than the Splattershot Pro, but weaker damage. They also share the code name of \"QuickLong\"."
