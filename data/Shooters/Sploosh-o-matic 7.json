    "The Sploosh-o-matic 7 is a main weapon in Splatoon and Splatoon 2. It is a Sploosh-o-matic with a pink color scheme.",
    "The Sploosh-o-matic 7 shares its overall design with the Sploosh-o-matic. However, pink parts replace the normal dull bronze parts, and the pressure gauge is replaced by a more mechanical dark gray screen with two red letters on it. The handlebars on the nozzle are twisted slightly.",
    "The Sploosh-o-matic 7 was released on 8 June 2016 as part of Sheldon's Picks Volume 2. This weapon is a fast-firing, low-accuracy shooter. It has a steampunk-style look, similar to its cousin, the Sploosh-o-matic. Due to its high attack power, it excels in short-range combat. The Sploosh-o-matic 7 comes in a set with Splat Bombs and the Inkzooka.",
