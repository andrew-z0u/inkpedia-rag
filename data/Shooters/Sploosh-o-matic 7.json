    "The Sploosh-o-matic 7 is a main weapon in Splatoon and Splatoon 2. It is a Sploosh-o-matic with a pink color scheme.",
    "The Sploosh-o-matic 7 shares its overall design with the Sploosh-o-matic. However, pink parts replace the normal dull bronze parts, and the pressure gauge is replaced by a more mechanical dark gray screen with two red letters on it. The handlebars on the nozzle are twisted slightly.",
    "The Sploosh-o-matic 7 was released on 8 June 2016 as part of Sheldon's Picks Volume 2. This weapon is a fast-firing, low-accuracy shooter. It has a steampunk-style look, similar to its cousin, the Sploosh-o-matic. Due to its high attack power, it excels in short-range combat. The Sploosh-o-matic 7 comes in a set with Splat Bombs and the Inkzooka.",
    "[1]",
    "The Sploosh-o-matic 7 retains the stats of the original model while adding more strategic options. Splat Bombs combined with an Inkzooka enable you to pressure opponents at both middle and long range. In fact, this weapon has so many uses, I bet it could even make your bed or do your laundry! (Not a guarantee.)",
    "The Sploosh-o-matic 7 returns in Splatoon 2. It was released on 3 April 2019 at  01:00 UTC as part of version 4.6.0.[3]. It comes with Splat Bombs and the Ultra Stamp.",
    "[4][5]",
    "The Sploosh-o-matic 7 keeps all the functionality of the original while also enabling a wide range of splatting styles! Splat Bombs will help you keep mid-range enemies at bay, while the Ultra Stamp will make nearby foes flee in terror! Are you the type to master seven styles of tactics, then use them in life AND on the battlefield? Then this set's for you!",
