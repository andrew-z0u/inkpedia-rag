    "The Kensa L-3 Nozzlenose is a main weapon in Splatoon 2. It is a Toni Kensa-branded variant of the L-3 Nozzlenose, and part of the Kensa Collection.",
    "The Kensa L-3 Nozzlenose shares its overall design with the L-3 Nozzlenose. However, befitting its status as a Kensa Collection weapon, it features an almost fully monochrome design. Its frame, reel, and nozzle are predominantly black, with small white accents. The hose is an opaque white and features a Toni Kensa-related wordmark repeatedly printed along its length. As with all Kensa Collection weapons, it also features a red Toni Kensa clothespin, in this case attached immediately behind the nozzle head.",
    "The Kensa L-3 Nozzlenose was released on 7 November 2018 at 02:00 UTC.[1] It comes with Splash Walls and the Ultra Stamp.",

    "- Amusingly, the placement of the red clothespin on this weapon would obstruct the in-universe wielder's view of the iron sights it is equipped with. It shares this trait with its fellow Kensa Collection weapon, the Kensa .52 Gal."
