    "The Custom Blaster is a main weapon in the Splatoon series. It is the Custom-branded  version of the Blaster, with identical stats.",
    "The Custom Blaster is nearly identical in appearance to the Blaster. The only difference between the two is that the Custom Blaster has a sticker bearing the Custom logo on the front part. In Splatoon 3 the Custom Blaster has two stickers, one on the top and the other on the bottom. The wires have also been changed from red to white.",
    "The Custom Blaster comes in a set with the Point Sensors and Bubbler.",
    "[1]",
    "The Custom Blaster is a standard-model Blaster with a customized appearance. No difference in stats, but this one comes with a Point Sensor to track down your foes wherever they hide! And with the Bubbler, you can charge in without fear once you've located them! What a great combo!",
    "The Custom Blaster returns in Splatoon 2 looking identical to how it did in the first game. It comes with the Autobomb and Inkjet.",
    "[3][4]",
    "The Custom Blaster comes with the same quality construction of the Blaster but features a reworked look! It shares the specs of the Blaster, but the included Autobombs are great for flushing out foes! Dealing with nasty campers? Take to the sky and say hello with the Inkjet! See yourself as a Turf War field general? This set's for you!",
    "The Custom Blaster returns in Splatoon 3 in Chill Season 2023. Its sub weapon is Point Sensor, and its special weapon is Triple Splashdown. The appearance remains almost the same as in the previous two games with a white Custom sticker, but now features white wires connecting to the barrel instead of red, the front sticker being rotated 180 degrees compared to its previous position, and a second additional white Custom sticker placed opposite the original.",
    "[5]",
    "Ah, the Custom Blaster! To call it a customized Blaster would be accurate, but that doesn't tell the whole story. And we need the whole story, don't we? Made with official Blaster parts, the Custom Blaster is best suited for ranged combat. Use the Point Sensor sub to mark your enemies for immediate demolition! If the other team DOES get too close for comfort, you've got the Triple Splashdown to hit them with three times the Splashdown! It's also a great way to ink turf. I recommend this powerful set to players who can't stand the sight of a single enemy on their home turf!",
