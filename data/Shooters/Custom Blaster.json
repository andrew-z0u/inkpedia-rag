Its sub weapon is Point Sensor, and its special weapon is Triple Splashdown. The appearance remains almost the same as in the previous two games with a white Custom sticker, but now features white wires connecting to the barrel instead of red, the front sticker being rotated 180 degrees compared to its previous position, and a second additional white Custom sticker placed opposite the original.\n\n- The Custom Blaster is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 13.3. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The ink consumption is 10% per shot, allowing the user to fire 10 shots on a full ink tank.\n\n- When firing continuously, it shoots a bullet every 50 frames (1.2 shots per second).\n\n- When firing from humanoid form, the first shot takes 14 frames to come out.

Targets outside of this radius but inside the full blast radius of 3.3 units will take between 70 and 50 damage, depending on how close to the center they are.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with players has a radius of 0.2 units.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with the environment has a radius of 0.2 units.\n\n- Shots cannot ever deviate from the inner reticle while on the ground.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while in the air is 10.0 degrees.\n\n- The outer reticle immediately expands after jumping. After 25 frames, the outer reticle will start shrinking, and will finish shrinking after 70 frames.\n\n- When jumping, the chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle is immediately set to 50%.\n\n- Shots initially travel straight at a rate of 0.945 units per frame for 9 frames.

Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 0.9131 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight).

Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- This number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n[5]\n\n- ▲ Reduced the amount of time it takes to begin recovering ink after firing by about 1/20th of a second: 60 frames → 57 frames.\n\nAh, the Custom Blaster! To call it a customized Blaster would be accurate, but that doesn't tell the whole story. And we need the whole story, don't we? Made with official Blaster parts, the Custom Blaster is best suited for ranged combat. Use the Point Sensor sub to mark your enemies for immediate demolition! If the other team DOES get too close for comfort, you've got the Triple Splashdown to hit them with three times the Splashdown! It's also a great way to ink turf. I recommend this powerful set to players who can't stand the sight of a single enemy on their home turf!\n\n- 2D Icon\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Custom Blaster\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Custom_Blaster_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nModel of the Custom Blaster rotating (link to file)\n\nFor competitive tips about the Custom Blaster\n\n- In all three games, the Custom Blaster has a white Custom sticker on the barrel.
