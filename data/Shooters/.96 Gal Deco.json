I'd recommend it to fighters who want to charge the front lines!(NA)\n\n- Promotional image\n\n- The Squid Sisters are showing the .96 Gal Deco\n\n- An Inkling shooting the .96 Gal Deco (front)\n\n- Running with the .96 Gal Deco\n\n- Shooting with the .96 Gal Deco (back)\n\n- Official art of an Inkling holding the .96 Gal Deco.\n\n- SplatNet icon\n\nThe .96 Gal Deco was released on 3 February 2018 at 02:00 UTC.[3] It comes with the sub Splash Walls and special Splashdown.\n\n- The .96 Gal Deco is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 180. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The ink consumption of 2.5% and ink tank capacity of 100% allows players to fire 40 shots before needing to refill the ink supply.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- When initially firing the weapon in humanoid form, the first shot takes 3 frames to come out.\n\n- When firing from swim form, the first shot takes 11 frames to come out.\n\n- The interval between firing and when the player is able to enter swim form or use a sub weapon is 4 frames.\n\n- When firing continuously, it shoots a bullet every 12 frames (5 shots per second).\n\n- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.4 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 20 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Each shot has a base damage of 62.\n\n- If a shot is in the air for more than 9 frames after being fired, it loses 1.6875 damage per frame until it reaches 35 damage at frame 25.\n\n- The bullet hitbox has a radius of 2 units.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while on the ground is 4 degrees.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while in the air is 11.3511 degrees.\n\n- The outer reticle immediately expands after jumping. After 25 frames, the outer reticle will start shrinking, and will finish shrinking after 70 frames.\n\n- The .96 Gal Deco starts off having a 4% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle.\nThis chance increases by 3% per shot, and maximizes at a 30% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 9 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- This chance increases by 3% per shot, and maximizes at a 30% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 9 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- When jumping, the chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle is immediately set to 40%.\n\n- Accuracy starts recovering 12 frames after the player stops shooting.

units.\n\n- The frequency at which ink drips from a shot occurs at a rate of 3.4 droplets per shot.\n\n- There are a total of 5 different droplet patterns that can be created while firing this weapon.\n\n- Droplets that occur within 11 units of the player have a radius of 24 units, and a width of 13 units.\nThese droplets have their radius multiplied by a value ranging from 1.2 if they fell from a height above 100 units to 1.4 if they fell from a height below 30 units.\n\n- These droplets have their radius multiplied by a value ranging from 1.2 if they fell from a height above 100 units to 1.4 if they fell from a height below 30 units.\n\n- Droplets that occur when they travel past 200 units of the player have a radius of 21 units.\n\n- All other ink droplets have a radius of 13.5

height below 30 units.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This chance increases by 3% per shot, and maximizes at a 30% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it

Splash Wall to protect yourself and vital areas from opponents' ink! Counter sudden attacks with the Splashdown! Recommended for strong-willed players that want to defend their territory at all costs!\n\n- Promotional image\n\nThe .96 Gal Deco returns in Splatoon 3 with the new redesign its default counterpart received. Its kit consists of Splash Wall and the Kraken Royale, essentially the same as in Splatoon. It released along with Fresh Season 2023 on 28 February 2023.\n\n- The .96 Gal Deco is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 18. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The ink consumption is 2.3% per shot, allowing the user to fire for about 8.6 seconds on a full ink tank.\n\n- When firing continuously, it shoots a bullet every 12 frames (5 shots per second).\n\n- When firing from humanoid form, the first shot takes 3 frames to come out. When firing from swim form, the first shot takes 11 frames to come out.\n\n- The interval between firing the weapon and being able to enter swim form or use a sub weapon is 4 frames.\n\n- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.04 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 20 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Each shot has a base damage of 62 and minimum damage of 35.\n\n- If a shot is in the air for more than 9 frames after being fired, it will lose about 1.69 damage every frame until it reaches 35 damage at frame 25.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with players has a radius of 0.2 units.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with the environment has a radius of 0.2 units.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while on the ground is 4 degrees.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while in the air is 11.3511 degrees.\n\n- The outer reticle immediately expands after jumping. After 25 frames, the outer reticle will start shrinking, and will finish shrinking after 70 frames.\n\n- The weapon starts off having a 4% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle.\nThis chance increases by 3% per shot, and maximizes at a 30% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 9 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- This chance increases by 3% per shot, and maximizes at a 30% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 9 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- When jumping, the chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle is immediately set to 40%.\n\n- Accuracy starts recovering 12 frames after the player stops shooting. The chance to shoot towards the outer reticle decreases by 2% per frame, if the chance is not already at the minimum, meaning that it takes 25 frames to reach maximum accuracy. (30 after shooting while jumping.)\n\n- Shots initially travel straight at a rate of 2.45 units per frame for 5 frames. Shots travel straight for 12.25 distance units.\nAfter that, the shot's velocity is set to 2.377 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 2.377 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight).

It's still short of a full 1.00 Gal, but that's OK, because now you have the Splash Wall as a sub weapon! That'll help you keep a safe distance while you blast away with your main weapon. Now, if anyone breaks through, all is not lost. That's when you call on the Kraken Royale to transform yourself into a giant squid or octopus! They say that the best offense is a good defense, and I say that's fundamentally impossible, but this set WILL give you the tools to play D with the best of 'em.\n\n- Promotional render\n\n- Early 2D icon\n\n- Current 2D icon\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the .96 Gal Deco.\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_.96_Gal_Deco_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nThe .96 Gal Deco model rotating (Link to file)\n\nFor competitive tips about the .96 Gal Deco\n\n.96 Gal Deco is short for .96 Gallon with the suffix Deco, short for either Decorated or Decoration. Deco may also refer to Art Deco. Gal is also a play on Cal, short form of Caliber, a term commonly used when describing the diameter of bullets for firearms. The suffix Deco is also used to differentiate it from the .96 Gal. This trait is shared among the other alternate sets of the Deco brand.\n\n.96ガロンデコ .96 garon deko has the same origin as the English name, but without Gallon shortened to Gal. Like the English name, Deco is also used to differentiate it from .96 Gallon."
