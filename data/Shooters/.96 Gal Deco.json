    "The .96 Gal Deco is a main weapon in the Splatoon series. It is the Deco-branded version of the .96 Gal.",
    "The .96 Gal Deco is similar in appearance to the .96 Gal. The .96 Gal Deco, however, has pink and white rhinestones covering the barrel, stock, and part of the water jug. These rhinestones form arrow patterns, one of the weapon brand Deco's common logos.",
    "The .96 Gal Deco was released on 8 July 2015 at 02:00 UTC.[1]",
    "The .96 Gal Deco has the same stats as the .96 Gal, but instead comes with the Splash Wall and the Kraken. Like the .52 Gal Deco, this gun also has a bedazzled look.",
    "[2]",
    "The .96 Gal Deco is a standard .96 Gal with a little added flair!\nUnlike the standard .96 Gal, though, you can approach with the Splash Wall, and then...release the Kraken.\nThat would be my strategy, anyway! I'd recommend it to fighters who want to charge the front lines!(NA)",
    "The .96 Gal Deco was released on 3 February 2018 at 02:00 UTC.[3] It comes with the sub Splash Walls and special Splashdown.",
    "[4][5]",
    "The .96 Gal Deco is a decorated version of the .96 Gal.\nIt's got the same stats as the .96 Gal, so use the Splash Wall to protect yourself and vital areas from opponents' ink! Counter sudden attacks with the Splashdown! Recommended for strong-willed players that want to defend their territory at all costs!",
    "The .96 Gal Deco returns in Splatoon 3 with the new redesign its default counterpart received. Its kit consists of Splash Wall and the Kraken Royale, essentially the same as in Splatoon. It released along with Fresh Season 2023 on 28 February 2023.",
    "[6]",
    "The .96 Gal Deco is a decorated version of the .96 Gal. It's still short of a full 1.00 Gal, but that's OK, because now you have the Splash Wall as a sub weapon! That'll help you keep a safe distance while you blast away with your main weapon. Now, if anyone breaks through, all is not lost. That's when you call on the Kraken Royale to transform yourself into a giant squid or octopus! They say that the best offense is a good defense, and I say that's fundamentally impossible, but this set WILL give you the tools to play D with the best of 'em.",
    "For competitive tips about the .96 Gal Deco",
    ".96 Gal Deco is short for .96 Gallon with the suffix Deco, short for either Decorated or Decoration. Deco may also refer to Art Deco. Gal is also a play on Cal, short form of Caliber, a term commonly used when describing the diameter of bullets for firearms. The suffix Deco is also used to differentiate it from the .96 Gal. This trait is shared among the other alternate sets of the Deco brand.",
    ".96ガロンデコ .96 garon deko has the same origin as the English name, but without Gallon shortened to Gal. Like the English name, Deco is also used to differentiate it from .96 Gallon.",
