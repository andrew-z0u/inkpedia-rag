    "The Kensa Splattershot is a main weapon in Splatoon 2. It is a Toni Kensa-branded variant of the Splattershot.",
    "The Kensa Splattershot shares its overall design with the Splattershot. However, the Kensa Splattershot is black and white with the Toni Kensa signature red clothespin attached to the grip under the muzzle. Unlike the Splattershot and the Tentatek Splattershot, the ink reservoir of the Kensa Splattershot does not change with the user's ink color and is always white.",
    "The Kensa Splattershot was released on 14 September 2018 at 02:00 UTC. It comes with Suction Bombs and Tenta Missiles.",
    "[1][2]",
    "The Kensa Splattershot is a limited edition, custom Splattershot created in collaboration with Toni Kensa! It has the same specs as the standard model, but its Suction Bomb sub and Tenta Missiles special bring the heat from a distance! With this set, using the sub and special weapons effectively is crucial to getting the most out of the Splattershot main! I hope all you collectors and lovers of exclusive weaponry get out there and give it a try!",
