    "The .96 Gal is a main weapon in the Splatoon series, created by Deco.",
    "As a member of the shooter class, this weapon distinguishes itself by sacrificing fire rate, ink efficiency, mobility, and accuracy for powerful shots and long range, being the ink-thirstiest and slowest of all regular shooters. The .96 Gal and its close relative the .52 Gal share their visual design and high-damage, low-accuracy performance.",
    "The .96 is designed resembling a revolver-type grenade launcher, with a water cooler bottle as a base, taking the role of the weapon's chamber (or, in this case, ink tank). A grip, sight, and high-caliber gun barrel are clamped to the bottle. The parts surrounding the bottle are black plastic with pink accents, while the bottle matches the player's ink color. In Splatoon and Splatoon 2, the sights are large and rectangular, and the barrel is black with pink polka-dot indents, while in Splatoon 3 the sights are smaller, more rounded, and have a glass element, and the barrel is transparent and filled with light-colored gravel or powder, with a metal muzzle and black stand attached. The frame of the weapon, which includes the sights and stock, is shaped differently in Splatoon 3.",
    "When the .96 fires, it emits large ripples in the air from its barrel, and produces a deep booming sound.",
    "This weapon is notably very similar in appearance to the .52 Gal, the main difference being that the .96 has a longer barrel, and in Splatoon 3 has a differently designed barrel, muzzle, sights, and underside of its frame.",
    "The .96 Gal comes in a set with Sprinklers and the Echolocator.",
    "[1]",
    "The .96 Gal's main weapon has an extra-large ink tank, allowing for powerful shots with a lot of range!\nAnd the Sprinkler and Echolocator can be used to keep foes riiiiiiight where you want them.\nSo it's an excellent weapon for fighters who want to control the pace of battle!(NA)",
    "The .96 Gal returns in Splatoon 2 looking identical to how it did in the first game. It comes with Sprinkler and Ink Armor.",
    "It appears in one Octo Expansion station:",
    "[2][3]",
    "The .96 Gal is a shooter that hits hard and has long range, courtesy of its large chamber and extended barrel! Of course, with that, you can't expect much from the fire rate, so make each shot count as you use the Sprinkler to spread ink! Also be sure to support your teammates with the Ink Armor! I recommend this for tactical players who want to squash their opponents in an all-out war!",
    "The .96 Gal returns in Splatoon 3 with a new design. The barrel is translucent, revealing a water filter design. Its kit is the Sprinkler and Ink Vac.",
    "It appears in one mission in Return of the Mammalians:",
    "[4]",
    "The .96 Gal is a shooter that hits hard and has a long range, courtesy of its large chamber and extended barrel! This thing would be an absolute cheat code if it fired just a little faster... but you can't have your crab cake and eat it too. You have to make each shot count! Still, you can set up a Sprinkler to help secure your turf... and the Ink Vac special doesn't suck. I mean, it DOES, but... you know what I mean!",
    "For competitive tips about the .96 Gal",
    ".96 Gal is short for .96 Gallon. \"Gal\" is also a play on Cal, the short form of Caliber, a term commonly used when describing the diameter of bullets for firearms.",
    ".96ガロン .96 Garon has the same origin as the English name, but without Gallon shortened to Gal.",
