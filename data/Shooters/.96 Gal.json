  "content": "The .96 Gal is a main weapon in the Splatoon series, created by Deco.\n\nAs a member of the shooter class, this weapon distinguishes itself by sacrificing fire rate, ink efficiency, mobility, and accuracy for powerful shots and long range, being the ink-thirstiest and slowest of all regular shooters. The .96 Gal and its close relative the .52 Gal share their visual design and high-damage, low-accuracy performance.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Splatoon\n\n2.1 Data\n2.2 Version history\n2.3 Quotes\n2.4 Gallery\n2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3 Splatoon 2\n\n3.1 Data\n3.2 Version history\n3.3 Quotes\n3.4 Gallery\n3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 4 Splatoon 3\n\n4.1 Data\n4.2 Version history\n4.3 Quotes\n4.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n4.5 Gallery\n\n- 4.1 Data\n\n- 4.2 Version history\n\n- 4.3 Quotes\n\n- 4.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 4.5 Gallery\n\n- 5 Strategy\n\n- 6 Trivia\n\n- 7 Etymology\n\n7.1 Names in other languages\n7.2 Translation notes\n7.3 Internal names\n\n- 7.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 7.2 Translation notes\n\n- 7.3 Internal names\n\n- 8 References\n\n- 9 Notes\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 4.1 Data\n\n- 4.2 Version history\n\n- 4.3 Quotes\n\n- 4.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 4.5 Gallery\n\n- 7.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 7.2 Translation notes\n\n- 7.3 Internal names\n\nThe .96 is designed resembling a revolver-type grenade launcher, with a water cooler bottle as a base, taking the role of the weapon's chamber (or, in this case, ink tank). A grip, sight, and high-caliber gun barrel are clamped to the bottle. The parts surrounding the bottle are black plastic with pink accents, while the bottle matches the player's ink color. In Splatoon and Splatoon 2, the sights are large and rectangular, and the barrel is black with pink polka-dot indents, while in Splatoon 3 the sights are smaller, more rounded, and have a glass element, and the barrel is transparent and filled with light-colored gravel or powder, with a metal muzzle and black stand attached. The frame of the weapon, which includes the sights and stock, is shaped differently in Splatoon 3.\n\nWhen the .96 fires, it emits large ripples in the air from its barrel, and produces a deep booming sound.\n\nThis weapon is notably very similar in appearance to the .52 Gal, the main difference being that the .96 has a longer barrel, and in Splatoon 3 has a differently designed barrel, muzzle, sights, and underside of its frame.\n\nThe .96 Gal comes in a set with Sprinklers and the Echolocator.\n\n- The .96 Gal is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- Each shot consumes 2.5% of the ink tank capacity.\nThis allows players to fire 40 shots before needing to refill the ink supply.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This allows players to fire 40 shots before needing to refill the ink supply.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- When firing continuously, it shoots a bullet every 12 frames (5 shots per second).\n\n- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.4 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 20 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Each shot has a base damage of 52.\n\n- Shots travel straight for 6 frames. After that, they may lose damage.

It comes with Sprinkler and Ink Armor.\n\nIt appears in one Octo Expansion station:\n\n- I02 Dinky Ink Station\n\n- The .96 Gal is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 180. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The ink consumption of 2.5% and ink tank capacity of 100% allows players to fire 40 shots before needing to refill the ink supply.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- When initially firing the weapon in humanoid form, the first shot takes 3 frames to come out.\n\n- When firing from swim form, the first shot takes 11 frames to come out.\n\n- The interval between firing and when the player is able to enter swim form or use a sub weapon is 4 frames.\n\n- When firing continuously, it shoots a bullet every 12 frames (5 shots per second).\n\n- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.4 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 20 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Each shot has a base damage of 62.\n\n- If a shot is in the air for more than 9 frames after being fired, it loses 1.6875 damage per frame until it reaches 35 damage at frame 25.\n\n- The bullet hitbox has a radius of 2 units.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while on the ground is 4 degrees.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while in the air is 11.3511 degrees.\n\n- The outer reticle immediately expands after jumping. After 25 frames, the outer reticle will start shrinking, and will finish shrinking after 70 frames.\n\n- The .96 Gal starts off having a 4% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle.\nThis chance increases by 3% per shot, and maximizes at a 30% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 9 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- This chance increases by 3% per shot, and maximizes at a 30% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 9 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- When jumping, the chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle is immediately set to 40%.\n\n- Accuracy starts recovering 12 frames after the player stops shooting. The chance to shoot towards the outer reticle decreases by 2% per frame, if the chance is not already at the minimum, meaning that it takes 25 frames to reach maximum accuracy. (30 after shooting while jumping.)\n\n- Shots initially travel straight at a rate of 24.5 units per frame for 5 frames. Shots travel straight for 122.5 distance units.\nAfter that, the shot's velocity is set to 23.77 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and decreases further as it

range, courtesy of its large chamber and extended barrel! Of course, with that, you can't expect much from the fire rate, so make each shot count as you use the Sprinkler to spread ink! Also be sure to support your teammates with the Ink Armor! I recommend this for tactical players who want to squash their opponents in an all-out war!\n\n- Promotional image\n\nThe .96 Gal returns in Splatoon 3 with a new design. The barrel is translucent, revealing a water filter design. Its kit is the Sprinkler and Ink Vac.\n\nIt appears in one mission in Return of the Mammalians:\n\n- 0206 Getting Lost in Three Easy Steps\n\n- The .96 Gal is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 18. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The ink consumption is 2.3% per shot, allowing the user to fire for about 8.6 seconds on a full ink tank.\n\n- When firing continuously, it shoots a bullet every 12 frames (5 shots per second).\n\n- When firing from humanoid form, the first shot takes 3 frames to come out.

The chance to shoot towards the outer reticle decreases by 2% per frame, if the chance is not already at the minimum, meaning that it takes 25 frames to reach maximum accuracy. (30 after shooting while jumping.)\n\n- Shots initially travel straight at a rate of 2.45 units per frame for 5 frames. Shots travel straight for 12.25 distance units.\nAfter that, the shot's velocity is set to 2.377 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 2.377 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight).

This thing would be an absolute cheat code if it fired just a little faster... but you can't have your crab cake and eat it too. You have to make each shot count! Still, you can set up a Sprinkler to help secure your turf... and the Ink Vac special doesn't suck.
