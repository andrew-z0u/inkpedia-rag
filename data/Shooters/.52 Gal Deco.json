    "The .52 Gal Deco is a main weapon in the Splatoon series. It is a bedazzled version of the .52 Gal with Deco branding and a different sub and special weapon.",
    "The .52 Gal Deco is similar in appearance to the .52 Gal. However, the .52 Gal Deco has pink and white rhinestones covering the barrel, stock, and part of the water jug.",
    "The .52 Gal Deco is in a set with the Seeker and Inkstrike.",
    "[1]",
    "The .52 Gal Deco is a standard .52 Gal with a little extra flair added by pro designers!\nIts stats aren't any different, but it does come with Seekers to open up new battle tactics. And with the Inkstrike as its special, this set allows you to really dominate the battlefield!\n(NA)",
    "The .52 Gal Deco was released on 20 January 2018 at 02:00 UTC.[3] It comes with the sub Curling Bombs and special Sting Ray.",
    "[4][5]",
    "The .52 Gal Deco is a standard .52 Gal with a little extra flair added by pro designers! This set comes with Curling Bombs to quickly close in on opponents or smoke them out with a well-placed wall bounce! And for those opponents that try to keep their distance, make 'em pay with the Sting Ray! I'd recommend this for savage players born without a self-preservation instinct!",
    "The .52 Gal Deco returns in Splatoon 3 with a slightly updated design. This weapon was added in the Fresh Season 2024 update. Its kit comes with the Curling Bomb and the Splattercolor Screen.",
    "[6]",
    "The .52 Gal Deco is a standard .52 Gal with a little extra flair added by pro designers!\nSame high attack power and low fire rate as the base model. If you're going to take this baby into a fight, I suggest ending it quick.\nThey zhuzhed it up a bit with a Curling Bomb to get you from point A to point B and a Splattercolor Screen to send foes scattering. It's a two-step recipe for ambushes!\nI recommend this weapon to fearless players who want to run rampant and sow discord on the front lines of a chaotic battlefield!",
    "For competitive tips about the .52 Gal Deco",
    ".52 Gal Deco is short for .52 Gallon with the suffix Deco, short for either Decorated or Decoration. Deco may also refer to Art Deco. \"Gal\" is also a play on Cal, the short form of Caliber, a term commonly used when describing the diameter of bullets for firearms. The suffix Deco is also used to differentiate it from the .52 Gal. This trait is shared among the other alternate sets of the Deco brand.",
    ".52ガロンデコ .52 garon deko has the same origin as the English name, but without Gallon shortened to Gal. Like the English name, Deco is also used to differentiate it from the .52 Gal.",
