height below 30 units.\n\n- If no ink droplets have occurred within 11 units of the player for 2 shots, the next shot the player makes will force a paint droplet to appear at the player's feet.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This chance increases by 3% per shot, and maximizes at a 25% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 8 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 18.472 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and decreases further as it travels.\n\n- These droplets have

And for those opponents that try to keep their distance, make 'em pay with the Sting Ray! I'd recommend this for savage players born without a self-preservation instinct!\n\n- Promotional image\n\nThe .52 Gal Deco returns in Splatoon 3 with a slightly updated design.

If you're going to take this baby into a fight, I suggest ending it quick.\nThey zhuzhed it up a bit with a Curling Bomb to get you from point A to point B and a Splattercolor Screen to send foes scattering. It's a two-step recipe for ambushes!\nI recommend this weapon to fearless players who want to run rampant and sow discord on the front lines of a chaotic battlefield!\n\n- Promotional render\n\n- 2D Icon.\n\n- The Tableturf card icon of the .52 Gal Deco.\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_.52_Gal_Deco_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nModel of the .52 Gal Deco rotating (link to file)\n\nFor competitive tips about the .52 Gal Deco\n\n- The Wandercrust reward for Ammo Knights (Inkopolis) features a .52 Gal Deco icon, which sports the design from previous games.\n\n.52 Gal Deco is short for .52 Gallon with the suffix Deco, short for either Decorated or Decoration. Deco may also refer to Art Deco. \"Gal\" is also a play on Cal, the short form of Caliber, a term commonly used when describing the diameter of bullets for firearms. The suffix Deco is also used to differentiate it from the .52 Gal. This trait is shared among the other alternate sets of the Deco brand.\n\n.52ガロンデコ .52 garon deko has the same origin as the English name, but without Gallon shortened to Gal. Like the English name, Deco is also used to differentiate it from the .52 Gal."
