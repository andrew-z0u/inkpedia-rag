Combining its rapid-fire capabilities with tricky Ink Mines allows for some great hit-and-run tactics. Add the Inkstrike into the mix, and it's the perfect package if you like causing complete and utter chaos!\n\n- Promotional image.\n\n- The Aerospray RG's range.\n\n- The Inkling girl on the right is holding the Aerospray RG in a promotion for Forge.\n\n- 2D art of an Inkling holding the Aerospray RG.\n\n- 3D art of an Inkling holding the Aerospray RG.\n\n- Art of several Inklings - the upper right one is holding the Aerospray RG.\n\n- SplatNet icon\n\nThe Aerospray RG returns in Splatoon 2 looking identical to how it did in the first game. It comes with Sprinklers and the Baller.\n\n- The Aerospray RG is a lightweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 110. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The ink consumption of 0.55% and ink tank capacity of 100% allows players to fire 181 shots before needing to refill the ink supply.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- When initially firing the weapon in humanoid form, the first shot takes 3 frames to come out.\n\n- When firing from swim form, the first shot takes 10 frames to come out.\n\n- The interval between firing and when the player is able to enter swim form or use a sub weapon is 2 frames.\n\n- When firing continuously, it shoots a bullet every 4 frames (15 shots per second).\n\n- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.72 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 15 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Each shot has a base damage of 24.\n\n- If a shot is in the air for more than 8 frames after being fired, it loses 0.75 damage per frame until it reaches 12 damage at frame 24.\n\n- The bullet hitbox has a radius of 2 units.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while on the ground is 13 degrees.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while in the air is 16 degrees.\n\n- The outer reticle immediately expands after jumping. After 25 frames, the outer reticle will start shrinking, and will finish shrinking after 70 frames.\n\n- The Aerospray RG starts off having a 6% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle.\nThis chance increases by 3% per shot, and maximizes at a 50% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 15 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- This chance increases by 3% per shot, and maximizes at a 50% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 15 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- When jumping, the chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle is immediately set to 40%.\n\n- Accuracy starts recovering 4 frames after the player stops shooting.

(38 after shooting while jumping.)\n\n- Shots initially travel straight at a rate of 22 units per frame for 3 frames. Shots travel straight for 66 distance units.\nAfter that, the shot's velocity is set to 18.945 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and decreases further as it travels.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 18.945 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and decreases further as it travels.\n\n- Ink droplets occur every 125

weapon.\n\n- Droplets that occur within 21 units of the player have a radius of 20 units, and a width of 13 units.\nThese droplets have their radius multiplied by a value ranging from 1.2 if they fell from a height above 100 units to 1.4 if they fell from a height below 30 units.\n\n- These droplets have their radius multiplied by a value ranging from 1.2 if they fell from a height above 100 units to 1.4 if they fell from a height below 30 units.\n\n- Droplets that occur when they travel past 150 units of the player have a radius of 17.8 units.\n\n- All other ink droplets have a radius of 12 units.\n\n- Droplets that are far from the player and all other droplets have their radius multiplied by a value ranging from 1 if they fell from a height above 100 units to 1.2 if they fell from a height below 30 units.\n\n- If no ink droplets have occurred within 21 units of the player for 4 shots, the next shot the player makes will force a paint droplet to appear at the player's feet.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This chance increases by 3% per shot, and maximizes at a 50% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 15 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 18.945 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and decreases further as it travels.\n\n- These droplets have

Well, today is your lucky day! The Aerospray RG set was made just for you! It's the same great Aerospray that lets you spray it—not say it—but the addition of the Sprinkler sub gives you absurd coverage. And when you need something with more mustard to make a strategic push, Booyah Bombs always live up to their name.
