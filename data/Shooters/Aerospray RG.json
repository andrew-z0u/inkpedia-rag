    "The Aerospray RG is a main weapon in the Splatoon series. It is a variant of the Aerospray MG with a golden paint job and a different loadout.",
    "The Aerospray RG shares its overall design with the Aerospray MG. However, the Aerospray RG is entirely golden, except for the black tube at the back and the Ammo Knights logo on the tank.",
    "The Aerospray RG comes in a set with the Ink Mines and the Inkstrike.",
    "[1]",
    "The Aerospray RG is like the Aerospray MG I built from my grandpappy's blueprints, only... shinier! Combining its rapid-fire capabilities with tricky Ink Mines allows for some great hit-and-run tactics. Add the Inkstrike into the mix, and it's the perfect package if you like causing complete and utter chaos!",
    "The Aerospray RG returns in Splatoon 2 looking identical to how it did in the first game. It comes with Sprinklers and the Baller.",
    "[2][3]",
    "The Aerospray RG set is a modified Aerospray MG set. It has the same great fire rate, but the Sprinkler gives this set absurd coverage! The Baller lets you cut off sections of your opponent's territory, so I strongly recommend it for players who really want to control the turf!",
    "The Aerospray RG returns in Splatoon 3, looking identical to how it did in the previous games. Its kit consists of Sprinklers and the Booyah Bomb. It was added to the game as part of the 2.0.0 update along with Chill Season 2022 on 1 December 2022.",
    "[4]",
    "Love the Aerospray MG but wish it came with a different sub and special? Well, today is your lucky day! The Aerospray RG set was made just for you! It's the same great Aerospray that lets you spray it—not say it—but the addition of the Sprinkler sub gives you absurd coverage. And when you need something with more mustard to make a strategic push, Booyah Bombs always live up to their name. I recommend this set for those who ink outside the box!",
