    "The Neo Sploosh-o-matic is a main weapon in the Splatoon series.",
    "The Neo Sploosh-o-matic is nearly identical in appearance to the Sploosh-o-matic. The only difference between the two is that the Neo Sploosh-o-matic has a sticker bearing the Neo logo on the marker.",
    "In Splatoon 3, the weapon's bronze accents have been changed to silver.",
    "The Neo Sploosh-o-matic was released on 11 November 2015 at 02:00 UTC.[1][2] It is the Neo-branded version of the Sploosh-o-matic. It comes with Point Sensors and the Kraken.",

    "The Neo Sploosh-o-matic is a custom Sploosh-o-matic emblazoned with an original emblem. Mark your opponents with the Point Sensor, and then crush them with the power of the Kraken! Getting in close is vital for this setup, so it is suited to battlers who excel at flanking their foes.(NA)",
    "The Neo Sploosh-o-matic returns in Splatoon 2. It was released on 10 March 2018 at 02:00 UTC.[4] It comes with Squid Beakons and the Tenta Missiles.",
    "[5][6]",
    "The Neo Sploosh-o-matic is a custom Sploosh-o-matic emblazoned with an original emblem.\nTo be honest, the main weapon is the same as the original, but now you can set a jump point for your teammates with the Squid Beakon!\nTo create space for your team, smoke out your opponents with the Tenta Missiles, and move on them while they flee!\nThis weapon set is suited for players who like close-quarters fighting, as well as those who like to coordinate with their team.",
    "The Neo Sploosh-o-matic returns in Splatoon 3. It functions the same as the normal Sploosh-o-matic, but has a different kit and appearance. Its kit consists of Squid Beakon and Killer Wail 5.1, which is based on the kit that the standard Sploosh-o-matic had in Splatoon. The weapon was teased in the Fresh Season 2023 poster shown on 16 February 2023 and was officially revealed on 23 February 2023. It released on 28 February 2023.",
    "[7]",
    "Like the Sploosh-o-Matic? Maybe you'll LOVE the Neo Sploosh-o-matic! That's because you get all the same attributes of the Sploosh-o-matic with a new original emblem. Plus a loadout that mixes things up! For example, now you can set a jump point for your teammates with the Squid Beakon. It's like a concierge service for carnage! And if you use the Killer Wail 5.1 to reveal hidden or distant opponents, you'll know just where to place that Squid Beakon. Teamwork makes the dream work, so if you fancy yourself a team player, give this set a try!",
    "For competitive tips about the Neo Sploosh-o-matic",
    "Neo Sploosh-o-matic is derived from Sploosh, a word similar to Splash, and Automatic, plus the prefix Neo, Ancient Greek for new. The prefix Neo is also used to differentiate it from the Sploosh-o-matic. This trait is shared among the other alternate sets of the Neo brand. The -o-matic suffix is also a common, cliché naming convention for technological gadgets.",
    "ボールドマーカーネオ Bōrudo Mākā Neo is in reference to the partly pen-based appearance of the Neo Sploosh-o-matic. The name is also to contrast it with the Splash-o-matic. The highly accurate Splash-o-matic is named after a sharp marker pen, while the Sploosh-o-matic with its wide, cone-shaped muzzle is more akin to a bold marker pen. Like the English name, Neo is also used to differentiate it from Bold Marker.",
