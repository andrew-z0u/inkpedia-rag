The prefix Neo is also used to differentiate it from the Sploosh-o-matic. This trait is shared among the other alternate sets of the Neo brand. The -o-matic suffix is also a common, cliché naming convention for technological gadgets.\n\nボールドマーカーネオ Bōrudo Mākā Neo is in reference to the partly pen-based appearance of the Neo Sploosh-o-matic. The name is also to contrast it with the Splash-o-matic. The highly accurate Splash-o-matic is named after a sharp marker pen, while the Sploosh-o-matic with its wide, cone-shaped muzzle is more akin to a bold marker pen. Like the English name, Neo is also used to differentiate it from Bold Marker."
