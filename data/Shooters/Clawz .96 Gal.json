The grip and middle section of the main reservoir are colored periwinkle, with the middle section of the base bearing the Emberz logo. The barrel of the weapon features the same glass design from the game's original .96 Gal, with the addition of six spikes protruding from the rim at the end of the barrel.\n\nThe Clawz .96 Gal has Angle Shooters and Tacticooler.\n\n- The Clawz .96 Gal is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 18. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The ink consumption is 2.3% per shot, allowing the user to fire for about 8.6 seconds on a full ink tank.\n\n- When firing continuously, it shoots a bullet every 12 frames (5 shots per second).\n\n- When firing from humanoid form, the first shot takes 3 frames to come out. When firing from swim form, the first shot takes 11 frames to come out.\n\n- The interval between firing the weapon and being able to enter swim form or use a sub weapon is 4 frames.\n\n- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.04 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 20 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Each shot has a base damage of 62 and minimum damage of 35.\n\n- If a shot is in the air for more than 9 frames after being fired, it will lose about 1.69 damage every frame until it reaches 35 damage at frame 25.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with players has a radius of 0.2 units.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with the environment has a radius of 0.2 units.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while on the ground is 4 degrees.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while in the air is 11.3511 degrees.\n\n- The outer reticle immediately expands after jumping. After 25 frames, the outer reticle will start shrinking, and will finish shrinking after 70 frames.\n\n- The weapon starts off having a 4% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle.\nThis chance increases by 3% per shot, and maximizes at a 30% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 9 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- This chance increases by 3% per shot, and maximizes at a 30% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 9 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- When jumping, the chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle is immediately set to 40%.\n\n- Accuracy starts recovering 12 frames after the player stops shooting. The chance to shoot towards the outer reticle decreases by 2% per frame, if the chance is not already at the minimum, meaning that it takes 25 frames to reach maximum accuracy. (30 after shooting while jumping.)\n\n- Shots initially travel straight at a rate of 2.45 units per frame for 5 frames. Shots travel straight for 12.25 distance units.\nAfter that, the shot's velocity is set to 2.377 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 2.377 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- The effective range is about 15.97 units.\nThis number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n- This number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n- This chance increases by 3% per shot, and maximizes at a 30% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 9 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 2.377 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight).

Sorry, I'm overcome with wild abandon just looking at the Clawz .96 Gal. The brand Emberz really went primal with the design, and it shows. Speaking of primal, this set can take down an enemy with a direct hit from the Angle Shooter and one follow-up from the main. It's enough to make the other team howl! And if all that howling and growling makes you thirsty, just set up a Tacticooler to support your team. You'll be an animal with this set!\n\n- 2D icon\n\nThe word clawz is a stylized spelling of the word claws, which matches the leopard-spot pattern on the main reservoir thematically."
