    "The L-3 Nozzlenose is a main weapon in the Splatoon series, manufactured by the \"D\" brand. It is an atypical, burst-fire shooter with which the player must repeatedly press  to fire, with each trigger pull resulting in a volley of three shots. It forms part of a pair with the similar but more heavy-duty H-3 Nozzlenose.",
    "As one of only two shooters in the series with no capacity for automatic fire, the L-3 Nozzlenose presents very uniquely. While all three shots within a burst are fired very fast, firing another burst has a slight delay. Four hits are needed to splat an opponent, meaning that at least two bursts need to be fired at an opponent to accomplish this.",
    "Overall, the L-3 Nozzlenose is a weapon that combines the aesthetics of a revolver with garden tools. Accordingly, it possesses some of the hallmarks of a traditional handgun, including a hammer and iron sights. However, in place of a firing chamber, it instead possesses a length of garden hose housed in a reel; the front of the reel also features a knob that appears to double as the end of the reel's spool and an analog to the extractor rod found on fixed-cylinder revolvers. The barrel is also replaced by a spray nozzle. The overall frame of the weapon is black, while the nozzle head and reel are blue. The hose is translucent and changes color to match the user's ink color.",
    "The L-3 Nozzlenose was released on 17 June 2015 at 02:00 UTC.[1] It comes with Disruptors and the Killer Wail.",
    "[2]",
    "Ah, now the L-3 Nozzlenose is a semiautomatic shooter. It fires three shots each time you pull the trigger! Its range and accuracy are great, but you can't keep firing by holding down , so good timing is a must! This set includes Disruptors and the Killer Wail as well. It's well suited to those who like to fight efficiently.(NA)",

    "The L-3 Nozzlenose returns in Splatoon 2 looking identical to how it did in the first game. It comes with Curling Bombs and Baller.",
    "It appears in one Octo Expansion station:",
    "[3][4]",
    "The L-3 Nozzlenose is a shooter of a different sort; it fires a three-shot burst each time you pull the trigger! You can't keep firing by holdin' , so keep an eye on your opponents, and wait for just the right moment to throw a Curling Bomb! Recommended for players that want to use the Baller to destroy their opponents' defense and soak up the spotlight!",
    "The L-3 Nozzlenose returns in Splatoon 3 with Curling Bombs as its sub and Crab Tank as its special.",
    "It appears in one mission in Return of the Mammalians:",
    "[5]",
    "Why fire once when you can fire three times? That's the question the L-3 Nozzlenose answers. One pull of the trigger launches three rapid shots. Now, don't get me wrong. This isn't a full-auto weapon. Holding down  is like pressing the \"close door\" button in an elevator - it does absolutely nothing! So you'll want to time your triple shots perfectly... and wait for the right moment to toss a Curling Bomb. Or, if a triple shot won't do the trick, there's always the Crab Tank! So who's this set for? Just about anyone! It's so balanced that both the freshest noobs and the crustiest veterans can find a use for it.",
    "For competitive tips about the L-3 Nozzlenose",
    "The L in the name means \"light\" (this is supported by the French and Spanish names of the weapon; some other languages use \"compact\" to similar effect), as this weapon is physically smaller, faster, and less powerful, making it the \"lighter\" of the two Nozzlenoses. The 3 refers to the number of shots fired by each burst.",
    "Nozzlenose refers to the spray nozzle that serves as the weapon's barrel; it may also be a play on \"bottlenose\", as in the bottlenose dolphins, referring to its manufacturer's dolphin logo design (the weapon's Dutch name also contains a similar dolphin-based reference).",
