  "content": "The L-3 Nozzlenose is a main weapon in the Splatoon series, manufactured by the \"D\" brand. It is an atypical, burst-fire shooter with which the player must repeatedly press  to fire, with each trigger pull resulting in a volley of three shots. It forms part of a pair with the similar but more heavy-duty H-3 Nozzlenose.\n\n- 1 Description\n\n- 2 Appearance\n\n- 3 Splatoon\n\n3.1 Data\n3.2 Version history\n3.3 Quotes\n3.4 Gallery\n3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 4 Splatoon 2\n\n4.1 Data\n4.2 Version history\n4.3 Quotes\n4.4 Gallery\n4.5 Demonstration\n\n- 4.1 Data\n\n- 4.2 Version history\n\n- 4.3 Quotes\n\n- 4.4 Gallery\n\n- 4.5 Demonstration\n\n- 5 Splatoon 3\n\n5.1 Data\n5.2 Version history\n5.3 Quotes\n5.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n5.5 Gallery\n\n- 5.1 Data\n\n- 5.2 Version history\n\n- 5.3 Quotes\n\n- 5.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 5.5 Gallery\n\n- 6 Strategy\n\n- 7 Trivia\n\n- 8 Etymology\n\n8.1 Names in other languages\n8.2 Translation notes\n\n- 8.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 8.2 Translation notes\n\n- 9 References\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 4.1 Data\n\n- 4.2 Version history\n\n- 4.3 Quotes\n\n- 4.4 Gallery\n\n- 4.5 Demonstration\n\n- 5.1 Data\n\n- 5.2 Version history\n\n- 5.3 Quotes\n\n- 5.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 5.5 Gallery\n\n- 8.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 8.2 Translation notes\n\nAs one of only two shooters in the series with no capacity for automatic fire, the L-3 Nozzlenose presents very uniquely. While all three shots within a burst are fired very fast, firing another burst has a slight delay. Four hits are needed to splat an opponent, meaning that at least two bursts need to be fired at an opponent to accomplish this.\n\nOverall, the L-3 Nozzlenose is a weapon that combines the aesthetics of a revolver with garden tools. Accordingly, it possesses some of the hallmarks of a traditional handgun, including a hammer and iron sights. However, in place of a firing chamber, it instead possesses a length of garden hose housed in a reel; the front of the reel also features a knob that appears to double as the end of the reel's spool and an analog to the extractor rod found on fixed-cylinder revolvers. The barrel is also replaced by a spray nozzle. The overall frame of the weapon is black, while the nozzle head and reel are blue. The hose is translucent and changes color to match the user's ink color.\n\nThe L-3 Nozzlenose was released on 17 June 2015 at 02:00 UTC.[1] It comes with Disruptors and the Killer Wail.\n\n- The L-3 Nozzlenose is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- Each shot consumes 1% of the ink tank capacity.\nThis allows players to fire 100 shots before needing to refill the ink supply.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This allows players to fire 100 shots before needing to refill the ink supply.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- When pressing , three shots will be fired at a time, as long as there is enough ink to fire all three.\nIf there is not enough ink to fire all three shots, then zero, one or two shots will be fired instead, depending on how much ink is left in the ink tank.\n\n- If there is not enough ink to fire all three shots, then zero, one or two shots will be fired instead, depending on how much ink is left in the ink tank.\n\n- When firing a burst, a shot is fired every 4 frames.\n\n- After the last shot in a burst is fired, another burst cannot be fired for 8 frames.\n\n- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.5 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 25 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Each shot has a base damage of 29.\n\n- Shots travel straight for 5 frames. After that, they may lose damage. A shot will lose damage until it reaches 14.5 damage at frame 15.\n\n- Shots have a radius of 2 units.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while on the ground is 1 degrees.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while in the air is 6 degrees.\n\n- The outer reticle immediately expands after jumping. The outer reticle will finish shrinking after 60 frames.\n\n- The chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle increases by 2% per shot, and maximizes at a 25% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle.\nThis means that it takes 13 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- This means that it takes 13 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- When jumping, the chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle is immediately set to 40%.\n\n- Accuracy starts recovering 4 frames after the player stops shooting.\n\n- Shots initially travel straight at a rate of 22 units per frame for 5 frames.

It fires three shots each time you pull the trigger! Its range and accuracy are great, but you can't keep firing by holding down , so good timing is a must! This set includes Disruptors and the Killer Wail as well. It's well suited to those who like to fight efficiently.(NA)\n\nAh, now the L-3 Nozzlenose is a semi-automatic Shooter.

That's the question the L-3 Nozzlenose answers. One pull of the trigger launches three rapid shots. Now, don't get me wrong. This isn't a full-auto weapon. Holding down  is like pressing the \"close door\" button in an elevator - it does absolutely nothing! So you'll want to time your triple shots perfectly... and wait for the right moment to toss a Curling Bomb. Or, if a triple shot won't do the trick, there's always the Crab Tank! So who's this set for? Just about anyone! It's so balanced that both the freshest noobs and the crustiest veterans can find a use for it.\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the L-3 Nozzlenose.\n\nFor competitive tips about the L-3 Nozzlenose\n\n- In Splatoon, Sheldon states that the L-3 and H-3 Nozzlenoses are semiautomatic; however, if that were true, they would only fire one shot per trigger pull instead of three. The weapons are actually burst-fire, which is seen as an intermediary step between semi- and fully-automatic fire.\nFurther, the heavy visual inspiration from revolvers also makes this choice somewhat confusing, as while semi-automatic revolvers are a proven (albeit unpopular) concept, a burst-fire revolver does not exist in the real world.\n\n- Further, the heavy visual inspiration from revolvers also makes this choice somewhat confusing, as while semi-automatic revolvers are a proven (albeit unpopular) concept, a burst-fire revolver does not exist in the real world.\n\n- Further, the heavy visual inspiration from revolvers also makes this choice somewhat confusing, as while semi-automatic revolvers are a proven (albeit unpopular) concept, a burst-fire revolver does not exist in the real world.\n\nThe L in the name means \"light\" (this is supported by the French and Spanish names of the weapon; some other languages use \"compact\" to similar effect), as this weapon is physically smaller, faster, and less powerful, making it the \"lighter\" of the two Nozzlenoses. The 3 refers to the number of shots fired by each burst.\n\nNozzlenose refers to the spray nozzle that serves as the weapon's barrel; it may also be a play on \"bottlenose\", as in the bottlenose dolphins, referring to its manufacturer's dolphin logo design (the weapon's Dutch name also contains a similar dolphin-based reference)."
