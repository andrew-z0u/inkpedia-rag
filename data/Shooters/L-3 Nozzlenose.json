    "The L-3 Nozzlenose is a main weapon in the Splatoon series, manufactured by the \"D\" brand. It is an atypical, burst-fire shooter with which the player must repeatedly press  to fire, with each trigger pull resulting in a volley of three shots. It forms part of a pair with the similar but more heavy-duty H-3 Nozzlenose.",
    "As one of only two shooters in the series with no capacity for automatic fire, the L-3 Nozzlenose presents very uniquely. While all three shots within a burst are fired very fast, firing another burst has a slight delay. Four hits are needed to splat an opponent, meaning that at least two bursts need to be fired at an opponent to accomplish this.",
    "Overall, the L-3 Nozzlenose is a weapon that combines the aesthetics of a revolver with garden tools. Accordingly, it possesses some of the hallmarks of a traditional handgun, including a hammer and iron sights. However, in place of a firing chamber, it instead possesses a length of garden hose housed in a reel; the front of the reel also features a knob that appears to double as the end of the reel's spool and an analog to the extractor rod found on fixed-cylinder revolvers. The barrel is also replaced by a spray nozzle. The overall frame of the weapon is black, while the nozzle head and reel are blue. The hose is translucent and changes color to match the user's ink color.",
    "The L-3 Nozzlenose was released on 17 June 2015 at 02:00 UTC.[1] It comes with Disruptors and the Killer Wail.",

    "- In Splatoon, Sheldon states that the L-3 and H-3 Nozzlenoses are semiautomatic; however, if that were true, they would only fire one shot per trigger pull instead of three. The weapons are actually burst-fire, which is seen as an intermediary step between semi- and fully-automatic fire.\nFurther, the heavy visual inspiration from revolvers also makes this choice somewhat confusing, as while semi-automatic revolvers are a proven (albeit unpopular) concept, a burst-fire revolver does not exist in the real world.",
    "The L in the name means \"light\" (this is supported by the French and Spanish names of the weapon; some other languages use \"compact\" to similar effect), as this weapon is physically smaller, faster, and less powerful, making it the \"lighter\" of the two Nozzlenoses. The 3 refers to the number of shots fired by each burst.",
    "Nozzlenose refers to the spray nozzle that serves as the weapon's barrel; it may also be a play on \"bottlenose\", as in the bottlenose dolphins, referring to its manufacturer's dolphin logo design (the weapon's Dutch name also contains a similar dolphin-based reference)."
