It has a similar color scheme to the Famicom, an early version of the NES which was released in 1983 only in Japan, hence its name.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Splatoon\n\n2.1 Data\n2.2 Quotes\n2.3 Gallery\n2.4 Demonstration\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Quotes\n\n- 2.3 Gallery\n\n- 2.4 Demonstration\n\n- 3 Splatoon 2\n\n3.1 Data\n3.2 Version history\n3.3 Quotes\n3.4 Gallery\n3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 4 Trivia\n\n- 5 Etymology\n\n5.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 5.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 6 References\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Quotes\n\n- 2.3 Gallery\n\n- 2.4 Demonstration\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 5.1 Names in other languages\n\nThe N-ZAP '83 shares its overall design with the N-ZAP '85. However, its barrel and handhold are maroon instead of gray, the body is a dark wheat color instead of white, and the trigger is black instead of red. The side of the handhold features additional buttons derived from the Famicom's standard controller.\n\nThe N-ZAP '83 was released on 8 June 2016, as part of Sheldon's Picks volume 2. It comes with the sub Point Sensor and the special Kraken.\n\n- The N-ZAP '83 is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- Each shot consumes 0.8% of the ink tank capacity.\nThis allows players to fire 125 shots before needing to refill the ink supply.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This allows players to fire 125 shots before needing to refill the ink supply.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- When firing continuously, it shoots a bullet every 5 frames (12 shots per second).\n\n- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.8 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 20 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Each shot has a base damage of 28.\n\n- Shots travel straight for 4 frames. After that, they may lose damage. A shot will lose damage until it reaches 14 damage at frame 15.\n\n- Shots have a radius of 2 units.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while on the ground is 6 degrees.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while in the air is 15 degrees.\n\n- The outer reticle immediately expands after jumping. The outer reticle will finish shrinking after 60 frames.\n\n- The chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle increases by 2% per shot, and maximizes at a 25% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle.\nThis means that it takes 13 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- This means that it takes 13 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- When jumping, the chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle is immediately set to 40%.\n\n- Accuracy starts recovering 5 frames after the player stops shooting.\n\n- Shots initially travel straight at a rate of 22 units per frame for 4 frames.

The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The ink consumption of 0.8% and ink tank capacity of 100% allows players to fire 125 shots before needing to refill the ink supply.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- When initially firing the weapon in humanoid form, the first shot takes 3 frames to come out.\n\n- When firing from swim form, the first shot takes 11 frames to come out.\n\n- The interval between firing and when the player is able to enter swim form or use a sub weapon is 3 frames.\n\n- When firing continuously, it shoots a bullet every 5 frames (12 shots per second).\n\n- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.84 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 20 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Each shot has a base damage of 28.\n\n- If a shot is in the air for more than 8 frames after being fired, it loses 0.875 damage per frame until it reaches 14 damage at frame 24.\n\n- The bullet hitbox has a radius of 2 units.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while on the ground is 6 degrees.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while in the air is 12 degrees.\n\n- The outer reticle immediately expands after jumping. After 25 frames, the outer reticle will start shrinking, and will finish shrinking after 70 frames.\n\n- The N-ZAP '83 starts off having a 1% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle.\nThis chance increases by 1% per shot, and maximizes at a 25% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 24 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- This chance increases by 1% per shot, and maximizes at a 25% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 24 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- When jumping, the chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle is immediately set to 40%.\n\n- Accuracy starts recovering 5 frames after the player stops shooting. The chance to shoot towards the outer reticle decreases by 0.5% per frame, if the chance is not already at the minimum, meaning that it takes 53 frames to reach maximum accuracy. (83 after shooting while jumping.)\n\n- Shots initially travel straight at a rate of 22 units per frame for 4 frames. Shots travel straight for 88 distance units.\nAfter that, the shot's velocity is set to 14.495 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and decreases further as it travels.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 14.495 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and decreases further as it travels.\n\n- Ink droplets occur every 110 units.\n\n- The frequency at which ink drips from a shot occurs at a rate of 1.4 droplets per shot.\n\n- There are a total of 11 different droplet patterns that can be created while firing this weapon.\n\n- Droplets that occur within 11 units of the player have a radius of 18 units, and a width of 10 units.\nThese droplets have their radius multiplied by a value ranging from 1.2 if they fell from a height above 100 units to 1.48 if they fell from a height below 30 units.\n\n- These droplets have their radius multiplied by a value ranging from 1.2 if they fell from a height above 100 units to 1.48 if they fell from a height below 30 units.\n\n- Droplets that occur when they travel past 200 units of the player have a radius of 16 units.\n\n- All other ink droplets have a radius of 11.6 units.\n\n- Droplets that are far from the player and all other droplets have their radius multiplied by a value ranging from 1 if they fell from a height above 100 units to 1.2 if they fell from a height below 30 units.\n\n- If no ink droplets have occurred within 11 units of the player for 4 shots, the next shot the player makes will force a paint droplet to appear at the player's feet.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This chance increases by 1% per shot, and maximizes at a 25% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 24 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 14.495 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and decreases further as it travels.\n\n- These droplets have their radius multiplied by a value ranging from 1.2 if they fell from a height above 100 units to 1.48 if they fell from a height below 30 units.\n\n[4][5]\n\n- ▲ When equipped, the Main Power Up gear ability will now also lessen shot spread variance when firing while on the ground, in addition to the benefits it previously provided.\n\n- ▲ Increased damage dealt to the Booyah Bomb armor by roughly 17%.\n\n- ▲ Points to fill special gauge: 180 → 170.\n\nThe N-ZAP '83 is a replica of a weapon shrouded in legend. The original was only produced for a short time, but I brought it back! Support the main weapon with the fire-and-forget Sprinkler sub, and bring on the rain delays with the Ink Storm special! If you value aggressive inking and want to take a trip down memory lane, this set's for you!\n\n- Promotional image.\n\n- This weapon is based on the early 1983 version of the Family Computer, which has square  and  buttons.\n\n- As opposed to the N-ZAP '85 and the N-ZAP '89, the N-ZAP '83 has no real-world equivalent due to the Famicom's zapper being modeled and colored to resemble a real-world revolver.\n\n- The N-ZAP '83's textures include the same text as the N-ZAP '85, including the copyright year still reading as 1985.\n\nN-ZAP '83 is a shortened form of NES Zapper 1983. '83 is based on the year the Nintendo Family Computer was released, which serves as inspiration for the design of the N-ZAP '83.\n\nThe N-ZAP '83 has the same name origin in all regions."
