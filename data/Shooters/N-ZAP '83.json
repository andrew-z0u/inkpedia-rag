    "The N-ZAP '83 is a main weapon in Splatoon and Splatoon 2. It is a Sheldon's Picks-branded variant of the N-ZAP '85 and comes with a different sub and special. It has a similar color scheme to the Famicom, an early version of the NES which was released in 1983 only in Japan, hence its name.",
    "The N-ZAP '83 shares its overall design with the N-ZAP '85. However, its barrel and handhold are maroon instead of gray, the body is a dark wheat color instead of white, and the trigger is black instead of red. The side of the handhold features additional buttons derived from the Famicom's standard controller.",
    "The N-ZAP '83 was released on 8 June 2016, as part of Sheldon's Picks volume 2. It comes with the sub Point Sensor and the special Kraken.",

    "- This weapon is based on the early 1983 version of the Family Computer, which has square  and  buttons.",
    "- As opposed to the N-ZAP '85 and the N-ZAP '89, the N-ZAP '83 has no real-world equivalent due to the Famicom's zapper being modeled and colored to resemble a real-world revolver.",
    "- The N-ZAP '83's textures include the same text as the N-ZAP '85, including the copyright year still reading as 1985.",
    "N-ZAP '83 is a shortened form of NES Zapper 1983. '83 is based on the year the Nintendo Family Computer was released, which serves as inspiration for the design of the N-ZAP '83.",
    "The N-ZAP '83 has the same name origin in all regions."
