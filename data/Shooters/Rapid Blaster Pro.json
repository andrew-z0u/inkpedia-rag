  "content": "The Rapid Blaster Pro is a main weapon in the Splatoon series, manufactured by Deco.\n\nThe Rapid Blaster Pro is a Rapid Blaster with an elongated handle and barrel, and increased range to match. Its range is the greatest of all blasters. As a trade-off, it has a slightly slower fire rate and higher ink consumption compared to the Rapid Blaster. Damage output and blast size are identical for both weapons.\n\n- 1 Appearance\n\n- 2 Splatoon\n\n2.1 Data\n2.2 Version history\n2.3 Quotes\n2.4 Gallery\n2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3 Splatoon 2\n\n3.1 Data\n3.2 Version history\n3.3 Quotes\n3.4 Gallery\n3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 4 Splatoon 3\n\n4.1 Data\n4.2 Version history\n4.3 Quotes\n4.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n4.5 Gallery\n\n- 4.1 Data\n\n- 4.2 Version history\n\n- 4.3 Quotes\n\n- 4.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 4.5 Gallery\n\n- 5 Strategy\n\n- 6 Trivia\n\n- 7 Names in other languages\n\n- 8 References\n\n- 2.1 Data\n\n- 2.2 Version history\n\n- 2.3 Quotes\n\n- 2.4 Gallery\n\n- 2.5 Demonstration\n\n- 3.1 Data\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Quotes\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.5 Demonstration\n\n- 4.1 Data\n\n- 4.2 Version history\n\n- 4.3 Quotes\n\n- 4.4 Weapon freshness rewards\n\n- 4.5 Gallery\n\nThe Rapid Blaster Pro is similar in appearance to the Rapid Blaster.

With that technology in hand, try catching your enemies in a little Toxic Mist before giving them a few inksplosions as a parting gift. And if anyone gets too close? Fire up the Ink Vac, and turn their own inkpower against them! This is a set that will make the tactically inclined player veeery happy.\n\n- An Octoling holding the Rapid Blaster Pro throwing out a Toxic Mist.\n\n- 2D icon before version 3.0.0.\n\n- 2D icon after version 3.0.0.\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Rapid Blaster Pro.\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:Splatoon_3_Rapid_Blaster_Pro_all_versions_comparison.mp4\n\n\nThe difference between the three versions of the Rapid Blaster Pro: The Rapid Blaster Pro Deco is the only one whose lights do not illuminate when fired.
