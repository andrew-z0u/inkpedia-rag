However, as a Kensa Collection weapon, it features an almost completely monochrome color scheme. It has an opaque black water jug, and the inside of the barrel is completely white with a black circle where the ink shoots out of. The rest of the gun is black with white polka dots. As with all Kensa Collection weapons, it also features red Toni Kensa clothespins, in this case two attached to the front sight.\n\nThe Kensa .52 Gal was announced on 4 December 2018. It was added to the game on 5 December 2018 as part of the version 4.3.0 release.[1]\n\n- The Kensa .52 Gal is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 133. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The ink consumption of 1.3% and ink tank capacity of 100% allows players to fire 76 shots before needing to refill the ink supply.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- When initially firing the weapon in humanoid form, the first shot takes 3 frames to come out.\n\n- When firing from swim form, the first shot takes 11 frames to come out.\n\n- The interval between firing and when the player is able to enter swim form or use a sub weapon is 3 frames.\n\n- When firing continuously, it shoots a bullet every 9 frames (6.67 shots per second).\n\n- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.6 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 20 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Each shot has a base damage of 52.\n\n- If a shot is in the air for more than 11 frames after being fired, it loses 1.375 damage per frame until it reaches 30 damage at frame 27.\n\n- The bullet hitbox has a radius of 2 units.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while on the ground is 6 degrees.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while in the air is 12 degrees.\n\n- The outer reticle immediately expands after jumping. After 25 frames, the outer reticle will start shrinking, and will finish shrinking after 70 frames.\n\n- The Kensa .52 Gal starts off having a 2% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle.\nThis chance increases by 3% per shot, and maximizes at a 25% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 8 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- This chance increases by 3% per shot, and maximizes at a 25% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 8 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- When jumping, the chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle is immediately set to 40%.\n\n- Accuracy starts recovering 9 frames after the player stops shooting. The chance to shoot towards the outer reticle decreases by 1.5% per frame, if the chance is not already at the minimum, meaning that it takes 25 frames to reach maximum accuracy. (35 after shooting while jumping.)\n\n- Shots initially travel straight at a rate of 22 units per frame for 4 frames. Shots travel straight for 88 distance units.\nAfter that, the shot's velocity is set to 18.472 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and decreases further as it travels.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 18.472 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and decreases further as it travels.\n\n- Ink droplets occur every 55 units.\n\n- The frequency at which ink drips from a shot occurs at a rate of 2.4 droplets per shot.\n\n- There are a total of 5 different droplet patterns that can be created while firing this weapon.\n\n- Droplets that occur within 11 units of the player have a radius of 19.7 units, and a width of 13 units.\nThese droplets have their radius multiplied by a value ranging from 1.2 if they fell from a height above 100 units to 1.45 if they fell from a height below 30 units.\n\n- These droplets have their radius multiplied by a value ranging from 1.2 if they fell from a height above 100 units to 1.45 if they fell from a height below 30 units.\n\n- Droplets that occur when they travel past 200 units of the player have a radius of 20 units.\n\n- All other ink droplets have a radius of 13 units.\n\n- Droplets that are far from the player and all other droplets have their radius multiplied by a value ranging from 1 if they fell from a height above 100 units to 1.2 if they fell from a height below 30 units.\n\n- If no ink droplets have occurred within 11 units of the player for 2 shots, the next shot the player makes will force a paint droplet to appear at the player's feet.\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This chance increases by 3% per shot, and maximizes at a 25% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 8 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 18.472 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and decreases further as it travels.\n\n- These droplets have their radius multiplied by a value ranging from 1.2 if they fell from a height above 100 units to 1.45 if they fell from a height below 30 units.\n\n[2][3]\n\n- ▲ Reduced the time to shoot from squid form by 1/60 of a second: 12 frames → 11 frames.\n\n- ▲ Increased damage dealt to opponent Splat Brellas by roughly 21%: 0.7 multiplier → 0.85 multiplier.\n\n- ▲ Increased damage dealt to opponent Splash Walls by roughly 10%: 1 multiplier → 1.1 multiplier\n\n- ▲ Minimum damage: 26 → 30.\n\n- ▲ When equipped, the Main Power Up gear ability will now also lessen shot spread variance when firing while on the ground, in addition to the benefits it previously provided.\n\n- ▲ Increased radius of ink coverage around feet when firing by roughly 4%: 1.4 → 1.45.\n\n- ▲ Increased damage dealt to the Booyah Bomb armor by roughly 17%: 0.6 multiplier → 0.7 multiplier.\n\n- ▲ Increased the likelihood the turf around the player's feet will be inked when firing: 2 → 0.\n\n- ▲ Extended the amount of time when firing continuously until shot spread reaches its max: 6 shots → 8 shots.\n\n- ▲ Reduced the amount of time it takes for shot spread to return to normal: 55 frames → 25 frames.\nMost Shooter-type weapons will have increased shot spread when continuously firing.\nWhen the player stops firing, the shot spread gradually returns to normal, but with this fix, the amount of time it takes to return has been reduced.\n\n- Most Shooter-type weapons will have increased shot spread when continuously firing.\n\n- When the player stops firing, the shot spread gradually returns to normal, but with this fix, the amount of time it takes to return has been reduced.\n\n- Most Shooter-type weapons will have increased shot spread when continuously firing.\n\n- When the player stops firing, the shot spread gradually returns to normal, but with this fix, the amount of time it takes to return has been reduced.\n\n- ▲ Increased the radius of ink that lands when shooting far away by roughly 27%: 16.5 units → 21 units.\n\n- ▼ Reduced the radius of turf inked when a shot lands far away by roughly 5%: 21 units → 20 units.\n\n- ▼ Points to fill special gauge: 180 → 190.\n\nThe Kensa .52 Gal is a limited-edition .52 Gal created in collaboration with Toni Kensa! Use the Splash Wall to set up a safe space for yourself, and then launch your attack from behind cover! Opponents ganging up on you? No sweat! Activate your Booyah Bomb and turn the tables on them in a flash! Are you a mischievous prankster who likes to foment chaos on the front lines? If so, this set's the one for you!\n\n- Promotional render\n\nFor competitive tips about the Kensa .52 Gal\n\n- Amusingly, the placement of the red clothespins on this weapon would obstruct the in-universe wielder's view of the iron sights it is equipped with. It shares this trait with its fellow Kensa Collection weapon, the Kensa L-3 Nozzlenose."
