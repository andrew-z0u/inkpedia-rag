    "The Kensa .52 Gal is a main weapon in Splatoon 2. It is a Toni Kensa-branded variant of the .52 Gal, and part of the Kensa Collection.",
    "The Kensa .52 Gal shares its overall design with the .52 Gal. However, as a Kensa Collection weapon, it features an almost completely monochrome color scheme. It has an opaque black water jug, and the inside of the barrel is completely white with a black circle where the ink shoots out of. The rest of the gun is black with white polka dots. As with all Kensa Collection weapons, it also features red Toni Kensa clothespins, in this case two attached to the front sight.",
    "The Kensa .52 Gal was announced on 4 December 2018. It was added to the game on 5 December 2018 as part of the version 4.3.0 release.[1]",

    "For competitive tips about the Kensa .52 Gal",
    "- Amusingly, the placement of the red clothespins on this weapon would obstruct the in-universe wielder's view of the iron sights it is equipped with. It shares this trait with its fellow Kensa Collection weapon, the Kensa L-3 Nozzlenose."
