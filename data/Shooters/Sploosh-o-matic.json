    "The Sploosh-o-matic is a main weapon in the Splatoon series, made by the weapon brand Neo.",
    "This weapon is a fast-firing, short-range, low-accuracy shooter.",
    "Similar to the Splash-o-matic, it has a steampunk-style look. However, the Sploosh-o-matic has a large metallic funnel attached to the muzzle like the flared muzzle of a blunderbuss.",
    "The Sploosh-o-matic was released on 8 July 2015 at  02:00 UTC.[1]",
    "It comes in a set with Squid Beakons and the Killer Wail.",
    "[2]",
    "With its wide muzzle, the Sploosh-o-matic is specialized for close-combat situations. Beat back the enemy while placing Squid Beakons on their turf, and then mop up with the deadly Killer Wail! This weapon set excels at opening holes in the opponents' defenses for your teammates to exploit.",
    "The Sploosh-o-matic returns in Splatoon 2. It was released on 5 August 2017 at  02:00 UTC.[3] It comes with Curling Bombs and Splashdown.",
    "It appears in three Octo Expansion Stations:",
    "[4][5]",
    "With its wide muzzle, the Sploosh-o-matic is well suited for close-combat situations. The Curling Bombs allow you to clear narrow pathways and push farther into enemy territory. And once you're there, send your enemies back to their spawn point with the Splashdown! This close-range weapon set excels at opening holes in your opponent's defenses for your teammates to exploit.",
    "The Sploosh-o-matic returns in Splatoon 3. Its kit consists of Curling Bombs and the Ultra Stamp.",
    "Its design was changed in the update preceding the release of Fresh Season 2023, with the formerly silver parts of the design now being black. This is reflected in the in-game artwork, as well.",
    "It appears in five missions in Return of the Mammalians:",
    "[6]",
    "With its wide muzzle, the Sploosh-o-matic is well suited for close-combat situations. And escorting you to those close-combat situations is the Curling Bomb! Let one loose, and it'll lay down a proverbial red carpet to your foes' feet. Combined with the Ultra Stamp's forward rush, you have one powerful setup for players who love getting up close and personal - or who want to blaze a path forward for their allies.",
    "For competitive tips about the Sploosh-o-matic",
    "Sploosh-o-matic is derived from sploosh, a word similar to \"splash\", and automatic. The -o-matic suffix is also a common, clichéd naming convention for technological gadgets.",
    "ボールドマーカー bōrudo mākā is in reference to the partly pen-based appearance of the Sploosh-o-matic. The name is also to contrast it with the Splash-o-matic. The highly accurate Splash-o-matic is named after a sharp marker pen, while the Sploosh-o-matic with its wide, cone-shaped muzzle is more akin to a bold marker pen.",
