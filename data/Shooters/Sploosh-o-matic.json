The -o-matic suffix is also a common, clichéd naming convention for technological gadgets.\n\nボールドマーカー bōrudo mākā is in reference to the partly pen-based appearance of the Sploosh-o-matic. The name is also to contrast it with the Splash-o-matic. The highly accurate Splash-o-matic is named after a sharp marker pen, while the Sploosh-o-matic with its wide, cone-shaped muzzle is more akin to a bold marker pen."
