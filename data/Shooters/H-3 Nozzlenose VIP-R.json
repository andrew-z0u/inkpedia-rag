It has an appearance intended to reproduce the \"texture\" of a snake, with scaly patterns on the green parts of the weapon, with the exception of the parts surrounding the pipes as well as the green circle at the end of the barrel, which remain smooth. A brown strap connected to a pointed metal piece is attached to the barrel of the weapon, while a Barazushi brand sticker is visible on the side, similar to the dolphin sticker of the H-3 Nozzlenose D.\n\nThe H-3 Nozzlenose VIP-R was announced on the Splatlands Collection trailer for Splatoon 3 and released on 12 June 2025. Its kit consists of Suction Bomb and Triple Inkstrike.\n\n- The H-3 Nozzlenose VIP-R is a middleweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 17. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The ink consumption is 2.08% per shot and 6.24% per burst, allowing the user to fire 16 full bursts on a full ink tank.\n\n- When pressing , three shots will be fired at a time, as long as there is enough ink to fire all three.\nIf there is not enough ink to fire all three shots, then zero, one or two shots will be fired instead, depending on how much ink is left in the ink tank.\n\n- If there is not enough ink to fire all three shots, then zero, one or two shots will be fired instead, depending on how much ink is left in the ink tank.\n\n- When firing a burst, a shot is fired every 5 frames.\n\n- After the last shot in a burst is fired, another burst cannot be fired for 20 frames.\n\n- When firing from humanoid form, the first shot takes 3 frames to come out. When firing from swim form, the first shot takes 12 frames to come out.\n\n- When a burst is started, it takes 35 frames before the user can enter swim form or use their sub weapon.\n\n- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.06 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 25 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Each shot has a base damage of 44 and minimum damage of 22.\n\n- If a shot is in the air for more than 8 frames after being fired, it will lose about 0.69 damage every frame until it reaches 22 damage at frame 40.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with players has a radius of 0.2 units.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with the environment has a radius of 0.2 units.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while on the ground is 1 degrees.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while in the air is 1 degrees.\n\n- The outer reticle immediately expands after jumping. After 20 frames, the outer reticle will start shrinking, and will finish shrinking after 50 frames.\n\n- The weapon starts off having a 1% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle.\nThis chance increases by 1% per shot, and maximizes at a 25% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 24 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- This chance increases by 1% per shot, and maximizes at a 25% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 24 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- When jumping, the chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle is immediately set to 40%.\n\n- Accuracy starts recovering 5 frames after the player stops shooting. The chance to shoot towards the outer reticle decreases by 0.5% per frame, if the chance is not already at the minimum, meaning that it takes 53 frames to reach maximum accuracy. (83 after shooting while jumping.)\n\n- Shots initially travel straight at a rate of 2.875 units per frame for 4 frames. Shots travel straight for 11.5 distance units.\nAfter that, the shot's velocity is set to 2.2698 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 2.2698 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- The effective range is about 15.06 units.\nThis number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n- This number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n- If there is not enough ink to fire all three shots, then zero, one or two shots will be fired instead, depending on how much ink is left in the ink tank.\n\n- This chance increases by 1% per shot, and maximizes at a 25% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 24 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 2.2698 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight).

Developed by Barazushi for use in harsh environments, this formidable weapon may have a low fire rate, but it has a high fear rate! Try drawing out your opponents with Suction Bombs and then sniping them. And if you can get the Triple Inkstrike charged?
