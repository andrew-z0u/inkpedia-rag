    "- Along with the Big Swig Roller Express, the Annaki Splattershot Nova is the only weapon made by the Splat brand that has the actual name of the brand it was created with in almost every translation of the game instead of suffixes meaning \"logo\" or \"branded\" like the other Splat weapons. Coincidentally, the base forms of both of these weapons both come from the Chill Season 2022."
