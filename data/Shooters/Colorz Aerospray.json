However, its steel is tempered, giving it a strong blue/purple tint. The Emberz logo is engraved instead of the usual Ammo Knights, and a circular ring in Emberz colors—neon red, neon green, and neon blue—is attached to the barrel of the weapon.\n\nThe Colorz Aerospray appears in Splatoon 3 on 12 June 2025, as part of the Splatlands Collection. Its kit consists of Burst Bomb and Splattercolor Screen.\n\n- The Colorz Aerospray is a lightweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 11. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The ink consumption is 0.5% per shot, allowing the user to fire for about 13.33 seconds on a full ink tank.\n\n- When firing continuously, it shoots a bullet every 4 frames (15 shots per second).\n\n- When firing from humanoid form, the first shot takes 3 frames to come out. When firing from swim form, the first shot takes 10 frames to come out.\n\n- The interval between firing the weapon and being able to enter swim form or use a sub weapon is 2 frames.\n\n- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.072 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 15 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Each shot has a base damage of 24 and minimum damage of 12.\n\n- If a shot is in the air for more than 8 frames after being fired, it will lose about 0.75 damage every frame until it reaches 12 damage at frame 24.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with players has a radius of 0.2 units.\n\n- The bullet hitbox for collisions with the environment has a radius of 0.2 units.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while on the ground is 12.63 degrees.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while in the air is 15.54 degrees.\n\n- The outer reticle immediately expands after jumping. After 25 frames, the outer reticle will start shrinking, and will finish shrinking after 70 frames.\n\n- The weapon starts off having a 6% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle.\nThis chance increases by 3% per shot, and maximizes at a 50% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 15 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- This chance increases by 3% per shot, and maximizes at a 50% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 15 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- When jumping, the chance to shoot towards the outer reticle instead of the inner reticle is immediately set to 40%.\n\n- Accuracy starts recovering 4 frames after the player stops shooting. The chance to shoot towards the outer reticle decreases by 1% per frame, if the chance is not already at the minimum, meaning that it takes 48 frames to reach maximum accuracy. (38 after shooting while jumping.)\n\n- Shots initially travel straight at a rate of 2.266 units per frame for 3 frames. Shots travel straight for 6.798 distance units.\nAfter that, the shot's velocity is set to 1.9513 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 1.9513 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- The effective range is about 10.09 units.\nThis number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n- This number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n- This chance increases by 3% per shot, and maximizes at a 50% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 15 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 1.9513 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- This number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n[1]\n\nI can neither confirm nor deny that the brand Emberz designed the Colorz Aerospray based on a surplus of paint colors at their factory.\nBut I can confidently say that aside from the spiffy new look, this weapon's performance is unchanged. And it comes with both Burst Bombs and the Splattercolor Screen!\nAltogether, these weapons can throw your enemies into a state of confusion, leaving you free to spray your colors freely on the front lines.\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- Promotional image of the Emberz collection\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Colorz_Aerospray_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nModel of the Colorz Aerospray rotating (link to file)\n\n- The Colorz Aerospray shares its design with a tricolor ring attached to the weapon with Glamorz Splattershot and Gleamz Blaster.\n\n- The tempered metal of the Colorz Aeropray may be a reference to Splatoon's Tempered Dynamo Roller. Both weapons originate from the Ammo Knights brand.\n\nThe word colorz is a stylized spelling of the word colors, referencing the Emberz brand."
