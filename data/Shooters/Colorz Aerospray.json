    "The Colorz Aerospray is a main weapon in Splatoon 3. It is an Emberz-branded version of the Aerospray MG.",
    "The Colorz Aerospray looks nearly identical to the Aerospray MG. However, its steel is tempered, giving it a strong blue/purple tint. The Emberz logo is engraved instead of the usual Ammo Knights, and a circular ring in Emberz colors—neon red, neon green, and neon blue—is attached to the barrel of the weapon.",
    "The Colorz Aerospray appears in Splatoon 3 on 12 June 2025, as part of the Splatlands Collection. Its kit consists of Burst Bomb and Splattercolor Screen.",
