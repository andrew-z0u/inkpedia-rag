    "The Splattershot Nova is a main weapon in Splatoon 3, manufactured by Splat. It is a long-range shooter that prioritizes rate of fire over damage.",
    "The Splattershot Nova has long range comparable to the Splattershot Pro but with a faster fire rate, less accuracy, and weaker damage, making its stats similar to the former Dual Squelcher from Splatoon. It is tied with the Aerospray series of weapons for the lowest damage stat of any shooter. The rate of fire is the same as that of the standard Splattershot.",
    "The Splattershot Nova has a more \"futuristic\" space-themed design than most other Splattershot-named weapons. It consists of an oversized plastic sports water bottle matching the user's ink color slotted into a black shooter frame, causing it to resemble a ray gun or Super Soaker.",
    "The Splattershot Nova was revealed in the Chill Season 2022 trailer on 14 November 2022 and was released on 1 December 2022. Its kit contains Point Sensors and Killer Wail 5.1.",
