Its main weapon is just like the Splattershot Jr., but this one lets you weaken your foes with Disruptors! It also comes with an Echolocator, so rally your team behind you and charge into the fray!\n\n- A pre-release version of the Custom Splattershot Jr.\n\n- Promotional for Museum d'Alfonsino - the second Inkling is holding the Custom Splattershot Jr.\n\n- The Splattershot Jr.'s and Custom Splattershot Jr.'s range.\n\n- Official art of an Inkling holding the Custom Splattershot Jr.\n\n- SplatNet icon\n\nThe Custom Splattershot Jr. returns in Splatoon 2. It was released on 9 September 2017 at 02:00 UTC.[2] It comes with Autobombs and Ink Storm.\n\nThe Custom Splattershot Jr. was enhanced in Splatoon 2 with a 110% capacity ink tank. The high-capacity ink tank is unique to the Splattershot Jr. and its variants. This allows players to throw two Autobombs consecutively without having to refill the ink between throws. Activating the Ink Storm special refills the ink tank, so players can then throw two more Autobombs in a short time.\n\n- The Custom Splattershot Jr. is a lightweight weapon.\n\n- The matchmaking range is 110. The game's matchmaking system looks at a team's average matchmaking range value, and matches them against a team with a similar average.\n\n- The ink consumption of 0.43% and ink tank capacity of 110% allows players to fire 255 shots before needing to refill the ink supply.\nThis stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- This stat can be changed with Ink Saver (Main).\n\n- When initially firing the weapon in humanoid form, the first shot takes 3 frames to come out.\n\n- When firing from swim form, the first shot takes 10 frames to come out.\n\n- The interval between firing and when the player is able to enter swim form or use a sub weapon is 2 frames.\n\n- When firing continuously, it shoots a bullet every 5 frames (12 shots per second).\n\n- When firing while moving, the player's movement speed is set to 0.72 units per frame.\n\n- After firing, there is a 15 frame cooldown before the ink tank starts refilling.\n\n- Each shot has a base damage of 28.\n\n- If a shot is in the air for more than 8 frames after being fired, it loses 0.875 damage per frame until it reaches 14 damage at frame 24.\n\n- The bullet hitbox has a radius of 2 units.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while on the ground is 12 degrees.\n\n- The angle its shots can deviate while in the air is 15 degrees.\n\n- The outer reticle immediately expands after jumping.

As such, it is the only one with a unique sticker; the rest all have the Custom logo. This is likely due to a mistranslation, since the Japanese prefix for it is different from the suffix for the Custom-branded weapon variants.\n\n- In Splatoon 2, the unique ink tank given to the Custom Splattershot Jr. allows the player to throw two Autobombs in a row without refilling ink or using any Ink Saver (Sub) (consuming the full capacity of the ink tank in the process).\nThe Custom Splattershot Jr. retains this larger ink tank in Splatoon 3, however, due to this iteration of the Custom Jr. having Torpedo instead (a more ink-hungry sub weapon - which also does not permit the user to throw a second Torpedo whilst the first Torpedo is still active anyway, regardless of ink cost), this trick is not possible.\n\n- The Custom Splattershot Jr. retains this larger ink tank in Splatoon 3, however, due to this iteration of the Custom Jr. having Torpedo instead (a more ink-hungry sub weapon - which also does not permit the user to throw a second Torpedo whilst the first Torpedo is still active anyway, regardless of ink cost), this trick is not possible.\n\n- The Custom Splattershot Jr. retains this larger ink tank in Splatoon 3, however, due to this iteration of the Custom Jr. having Torpedo instead (a more ink-hungry sub weapon - which also does not permit the user to throw a second Torpedo whilst the first Torpedo is still active anyway, regardless of ink cost), this trick is not possible.\n\nCustom Splattershot Jr. is a combination of Splatter (as well as Splat), Shot, and the shortened form of Junior (Jr.) at the end. It also has Custom as a prefix to differentiate it from the Splattershot Jr. Despite its name, it is not part of the Custom brand."
