    "The Custom Splattershot Jr. is a main weapon in the Splatoon series. It is a variant of the Splattershot Jr., equipped with a star-shaped sticker on the side and an alternate loadout.",
    "The Custom Splattershot Jr. is nearly identical in appearance to the Splattershot Jr. The only difference between the two is that the Custom Splattershot Jr. has a large sticker of a two-tone orange star with cartoon eyes similar to the \"Jr. Mark\" symbol seen on the Basic Tee.",
    "In Splatoon 2, the Custom Splattershot Jr. and its variants also replace the user's standard ink tank with the one resembling baby bottles. It has a rounded rectangular shape and a round cap. For the Custom Splattershot Jr., an orange tag with the aforementioned two-tone orange star is attached around the bottle's neck. The main body changes color to match the wielder's ink color.",
    "The Custom Splattershot Jr. is the first weapon unlocked from Octo Valley. It can only be purchased after collecting the Sunken Scroll from the mission The Mighty Octostomp!. It comes in a set with Disruptors and the Echolocator.",

    "The Custom Splattershot Jr. returns in Splatoon 2. It was released on 9 September 2017 at 02:00 UTC.[2] It comes with Autobombs and Ink Storm.",
    "The Custom Splattershot Jr. was enhanced in Splatoon 2 with a 110% capacity ink tank. The high-capacity ink tank is unique to the Splattershot Jr. and its variants. This allows players to throw two Autobombs consecutively without having to refill the ink between throws. Activating the Ink Storm special refills the ink tank, so players can then throw two more Autobombs in a short time.",

    "For competitive tips about the Custom Splattershot Jr.",
    "- The Custom Splattershot Jr. is the only weapon with the \"custom\" prefix not made by the Custom brand. As such, it is the only one with a unique sticker; the rest all have the Custom logo. This is likely due to a mistranslation, since the Japanese prefix for it is different from the suffix for the Custom-branded weapon variants.",
    "- In Splatoon 2, the unique ink tank given to the Custom Splattershot Jr. allows the player to throw two Autobombs in a row without refilling ink or using any Ink Saver (Sub) (consuming the full capacity of the ink tank in the process).\nThe Custom Splattershot Jr. retains this larger ink tank in Splatoon 3, however, due to this iteration of the Custom Jr. having Torpedo instead (a more ink-hungry sub weapon - which also does not permit the user to throw a second Torpedo whilst the first Torpedo is still active anyway, regardless of ink cost), this trick is not possible.",
    "Custom Splattershot Jr. is a combination of Splatter (as well as Splat), Shot, and the shortened form of Junior (Jr.) at the end. It also has Custom as a prefix to differentiate it from the Splattershot Jr. Despite its name, it is not part of the Custom brand."
