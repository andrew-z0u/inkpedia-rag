    "The Jet Squelcher is a main weapon in the Splatoon series, created by Custom.",
    "It has a slow fire rate and low damage compared to other shooters, but has more range than any other shooter.",
    "The Jet Squelcher has two main parts, both blue. The handhold housing the trigger is in between them. The top part is home to multiple warning labels and a black knob. Sticking out of the top part is a long black barrel with a dull white nozzle at the end. A black tube connects the two parts.",
    "The Jet Squelcher comes with the sub Splash Wall and the special Inkstrike.",
    "[1]",
    "The Jet Squelcher has the top range of any rapid-fire weapon, approaching that of the charger weapons.\nIt sacrifices attack power, though, so focus on hiding behind your Splash Wall and charging up the Inkstrike!\nIt's best for fighters who know how to strike at the most opportune moment!\n(NA)",
    "The Jet Squelcher has the top range of any Shooter-type weapon, approaching that of Charger-types.\nIt sacrifices attack power, though, so focus on hiding behind your Splash Wall and charging up the Inkstrike!\nIt's best suited to fighters who know how to hold back before striking at the most opportune moment!\n(EU/OC)",
    "The Jet Squelcher returns in Splatoon 2 looking identical to how it did in the first game. It comes with Toxic Mist and Tenta Missiles.",
    "It appears in ten Octo Expansion stations:",
    "[2][3]",
    "The Jet Squelcher has boosted pump pressure to give it a range that rivals charger weapons! Use that range to safely splat opponents caught in your Toxic Mist. The main weapon's attack power is on the weaker side, but you've got Tenta Missiles, and it's great for cleaning up the leftovers! Keep moving forward as you splat your opponents! Recommended for players who know when to push and when to hold their ground!",
    "The Jet Squelcher returns in Splatoon 3, looking identical to the past game. It has Angle Shooters and the Ink Vac as its kit.",
    "It appears in three missions in Return of the Mammalians:",
    "[4]",
    "The Jet Squelcher has boosted pump pressure to give it a range that rivals charger weapons! Like other weapons with extreme range, it doesn't offer much in the way of power. But when combined with the Angle Shooter sub, your enemies won't know what hit 'em. Because you'll be SO far away! Add the Ink Vac to the mix to suck up incoming offensives, and you have a loadout that's perfect for cool, calculating players who play it safe.",
    "For competitive tips about the Jet Squelcher",
    "Jet Squelcher is derived from \"Jet Washer\", a name pressure washers are commonly marketed under with Squelcher meaning \"to squelch\", being an onomatopoeia of splashing liquid.",
