Use that range to safely splat opponents caught in your Toxic Mist. The main weapon's attack power is on the weaker side, but you've got Tenta Missiles, and it's great for cleaning up the leftovers! Keep moving forward as you splat your opponents!

Like other weapons with extreme range, it doesn't offer much in the way of power. But when combined with the Angle Shooter sub, your enemies won't know what hit 'em. Because you'll be SO far away! Add the Ink Vac to the mix to suck up incoming offensives, and you have a loadout that's perfect for cool, calculating players who play it safe.\n\n- The middle left Inkling is wielding the Jet Squelcher.\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Jet Squelcher.\n\nFor competitive tips about the Jet Squelcher\n\n- The design of the Jet Squelcher appears to be based on a Pressure Washer.\n\nJet Squelcher is derived from \"Jet Washer\", a name pressure washers are commonly marketed under with Squelcher meaning \"to squelch\", being an onomatopoeia of splashing liquid."
