    "The Clash Blaster is a main weapon in Splatoon 2 and Splatoon 3, manufactured by Neo. It is a blaster with a high rate of fire and large blast radius, but with low damage.",
    "The Clash Blaster fires at a short range, and at very high speed, but takes two direct hits to splat an opponent; from afar it takes around four hits.\nThe Clash Blaster behaves as a pressure-based weapon. Compared to other blasters, which require a direct hit for quick splats, the Clash Blaster fires more rapidly, increasing mobility and turf coverage.",
    "The Clash Blaster's main body is a light navy blue and shaped a bit like a pencil sharpener. Surrounding it is a ring of crayons that change color to match the user's ink that resembles a gun belt. Coming down from the body is a metal trigger and a handhold with black padding. Sticking out of the front of the body is a flat, rectangular, metal part that delivers the shots. Atop this part is a sight the same color as the body.",
    "The Clash Blaster was released in Splatoon 2 at the game's initial release. Its kit contains Splat Bomb and Sting Ray.",
    "It appears in two Octo Expansion stations:",
    "- G09 B05 Wack 8-Ball Station",
    "- J07 Outrageous Station",

    "- Promotional image",
    "- An Inkling girl holding the Clash Blaster.",
    "The Clash Blaster returns in Splatoon 3 with the same attributes and appearance as the previous game. Its set is Splat Bomb and Trizooka.",
    "It appears in one mission in Return of the Mammalians:",
    "- 0601 Bet You Mist Us!",
    "[3]",
    "- An Inkling boy holding the Clash Blaster while sitting at Museum d'Alfonsino.",

    "- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Clash Blaster.",
    "- A Fuzzy Octarian with a Clash Blaster from the Mellow Squid 4-Panel Comic",
    "For competitive tips about the Clash Blaster",
    "- The Clash Blaster's design is likely based on a mechanical pencil sharpener, hence the crayons.",
    "- In Splatoon 2, the Clash Blaster is one of the only three weapons to be unlocked simultaneously with its alternate kit, the Clash Blaster Neo. The other two are the H-3 Nozzlenose D and Cherry H-3 Nozzlenose, and the E-liter 4K Scope and Custom E-liter 4K Scope. It however remains as the only completely unique weapon.\nThis is due to the Clash Blaster being unlocked at Level 30, which is the highest level for unlocking weapons."
