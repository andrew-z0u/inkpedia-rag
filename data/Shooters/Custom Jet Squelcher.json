(46 after shooting while jumping.)\n\n- Shots initially travel straight at a rate of 3.36 units per frame for 5 frames. Shots travel straight for 16.8 distance units.\nAfter that, the shot's velocity is set to 2.232 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 2.232 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight). Once the shot velocity decreases below a certain threshold, it will begin to be slowed less and fall faster.\n\n- The effective range is about 20.3 units.\nThis number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n- This number may vary at different firing angles.\n\n- This chance increases by 1.5% per shot, and maximizes at a 25% chance to shoot towards the outer reticle, meaning that it takes 16 shots to reach minimum accuracy.\n\n- After that, the shot's velocity is set to 2.232 units per frame if it is not already lower than the listed value, and it loses 36% of its speed every frame (including the first frame after it stops traveling straight).

It's custom! But it's still made with high-quality official parts. And this set now comes with the Toxic Mist sub, which helps make up for the main weapon's lower fire rate and firepower by bogging down your enemies in, well, toxic mist. Meanwhile, toss the Ink Storm special out there when you can, and it'll be like splatting fish in a barrel for your teammates. Master this set, and it'll be a one-sided battle, with you on the winning side!\n\n- The Custom Jet Squelcher being shown off in the Fresh Season 2023 promotional poster.\n\n- An Inkling using the Custom Jet Squelcher while surrounded by Super Chump balloons.\n\n- Promotional render\n\n- 2D icon\n\n- The Tableturf Battle card icon of the Custom Jet Squelcher.\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Custom_Jet_Squelcher_model_rotating.mp4\n\n\nModel of the Custom Jet Squelcher rotating (Link to file)\n\nFor competitive tips about the Custom Jet Squelcher"
