    "The Custom Jet Squelcher is a main weapon in the Splatoon series. It is the Custom version of the Jet Squelcher.",
    "In Splatoon and Splatoon 2, The Custom Jet Squelcher is nearly identical in appearance to the Jet Squelcher, with the only difference being that the Custom Jet Squelcher has a sticker on the bottom part bearing the Custom logo.",
    "In Splatoon 3, the color of the Custom Jet Squelcher's nozzle has been changed from dull white to yellow.",
    "The Custom Jet Squelcher is identical to the Jet Squelcher, but has the Burst Bomb as a sub weapon and the Kraken as a special.",
    "[1]",
    "The Custom Jet Squelcher is just a Jet Squelcher with a custom appearance. No surprise there! It comes with Burst Bombs to pin down your foes and the Kraken to let you deal the finishing blow! If you like to keep your foes under pressure, this weapon set could be just what you're looking for!",
    "The Custom Jet Squelcher returns in Splatoon 2 looking identical to how it did in the first game. It was released on 3 November 2017 at 02:00 UTC[2]. It comes with Burst Bombs and Sting Ray.",
    "[3][4]",
    "The Custom Jet Squelcher is a customized Jet Squelcher made with official parts! It boasts great range, and you can lay the splat down on enemies that get too close with the included Burst Bombs! Use the Sting Ray to deal with anyone out of the range of your main weapon. I recommend keeping your distance with this set.",
    "The Custom Jet Squelcher returns in Splatoon 3. It functions the same as the normal Jet Squelcher, but has a different kit and appearance. It has a Custom sticker on the side, and features a yellow tip at the end, rather than the traditional gray. Its kit is Toxic Mist and the Ink Storm. The weapon was teased to return in the Fresh Season poster shown on 16 February 2023, as well as in a promotional video for the Super Chump special shown on 17 February 2023. The weapon was released on 1 March 2023.",
    "[5]",
    "The Custom Jet Squelcher is no off-the-rack Jet Squelcher. It's custom! But it's still made with high-quality official parts. And this set now comes with the Toxic Mist sub, which helps make up for the main weapon's lower fire rate and firepower by bogging down your enemies in, well, toxic mist. Meanwhile, toss the Ink Storm special out there when you can, and it'll be like splatting fish in a barrel for your teammates. Master this set, and it'll be a one-sided battle, with you on the winning side!",
