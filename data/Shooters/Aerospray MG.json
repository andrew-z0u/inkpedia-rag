    "The Aerospray MG is a main weapon in the Splatoon series, created by the weapon brand Ammo Knights.",
    "The Aerospray MG has an extremely high fire rate, but each shot is weak individually. It takes five hits to splat an opponent. It shares its spot as the shooter with the lowest damage with the Splattershot Nova. It shoots with high spread, allowing its users to quickly cover turf and to hit opponents without perfectly aiming at them.",
    "The Aerospray MG is a short, silver gun reminiscent of an aerosol spray pen, with a large tank on top bearing the Ammo Knights logo in black. Underneath the tank is a silver pipe that serves as a barrel with a wide nozzle on the end. Attaching the tank to the barrel is a pair of silver supports. Underneath the nozzle is a metal slope seemingly designed to stop ink from getting on the user's hand. In the back of the Aerospray MG is a thin black tube connecting the side of the barrel to the bottom.",
    "The Aerospray MG comes in a set with Seekers and the Inkzooka. It can only be purchased after defeating The Rampaging Octowhirl! boss battle and obtaining its Sunken Scroll. It was created by Sheldon from his grandfather's blueprints.",
    "[1]",
    "Now the Aerospray MG is a shooter I made with a little help from my grandpappy's blueprints. Its range and accuracy are nothing to sneeze at, but the real draw is its amazing rate of fire! The Seekers and the Inkzooka are so easy to use, you're sure to have a blast! Thanks, Grandpappy!",
    "The Aerospray MG returns in Splatoon 2, looking identical to how it did in Splatoon. It comes with Suction Bombs and the Curling-Bomb Launcher.",
    "It appears in one Octo Expansion station:",
    "[2][3]",
    "The range and accuracy of the Aerospray MG aren't anything to write home about, but it's got an incredible rate of fire! Combined with the Suction Bomb as a sub, the main weapon offers great power and great ink spread to boot! You can really surprise your opponents with the Curling-Bomb Launcher special, so don't miss out on this set!",
    "The Aerospray MG returns in Splatoon 3, looking identical to how it did in the previous games. Its kit consists of Fizzy Bombs and the Reefslider.",
    "It appears in one mission in Return of the Mammalians:",
    "[4]",
    "The range and accuracy of the Aerospray MG aren't anything to write home about, but break out a pen and some stationery for its rate of fire! And when you pair a nimble weapon like that with Fizzy Bombs, it makes movement a breeze. You can quickly lock down plenty of turf to help support your teammates. Of course, inking turf is the name of the game, but sometimes you need a little extra OOMPH, and that's where Reefslider special comes in. Ride it to glorious victory! This setup is ideal for players who like to mix it up - tactically pushing the front line and waiting for the right moment to go big.",
