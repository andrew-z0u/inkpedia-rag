    "The Aerospray MG is a main weapon in the Splatoon series, created by the weapon brand Ammo Knights.",
    "The Aerospray MG has an extremely high fire rate, but each shot is weak individually. It takes five hits to splat an opponent. It shares its spot as the shooter with the lowest damage with the Splattershot Nova. It shoots with high spread, allowing its users to quickly cover turf and to hit opponents without perfectly aiming at them.",
    "The Aerospray MG is a short, silver gun reminiscent of an aerosol spray pen, with a large tank on top bearing the Ammo Knights logo in black. Underneath the tank is a silver pipe that serves as a barrel with a wide nozzle on the end. Attaching the tank to the barrel is a pair of silver supports. Underneath the nozzle is a metal slope seemingly designed to stop ink from getting on the user's hand. In the back of the Aerospray MG is a thin black tube connecting the side of the barrel to the bottom.",
    "The Aerospray MG comes in a set with Seekers and the Inkzooka. It can only be purchased after defeating The Rampaging Octowhirl! boss battle and obtaining its Sunken Scroll. It was created by Sheldon from his grandfather's blueprints.",

    "- In Splatoon 2, the Aerospray MG was the only weapon to be unlocked at its level for more than a year-from its debut in July 2017 to the Kensa Splattershot's debut in September 2018.",
