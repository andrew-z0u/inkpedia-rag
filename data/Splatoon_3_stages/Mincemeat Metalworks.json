  "content": "Mincemeat Metalworks is a multiplayer stage in Splatoon 3. It is a metalwork in the Splatlands in what used to be an ocean that evaporated.

One layer down features a large open area with a single bumper as cover. This large area is connected to the layer down by a grate bridge. The left leads to another open area that connects to the center of the stage with a sponge to retreat to the platform. Each team's platform features some walls and bumpers as cover along with the grate bridge on the right. The center of the stage features two raised areas, all connected by grates that also lead to the opponent's platform. Blocks are also added to the right of these raised areas.\n\nFollowing version 6.1.0 Mincemeat Metalworks received a major rework. The grate leading to the opponent's open area was made shorter and more inkable ground was added to the right of spawn. The far left now features a new raised area that allows a little more safer access to the center of the stage. The center of the stage was made much wider with more inkable ground and the pole was replaced with a small stack of blocks. The center grate is now climeable with a block and a pole was added at the center of the stage.\n\nIn Ranked Battles, specifications for the terrain or placement of objects are different between the modes; these changes create new paths or new objects to take cover behind.\n\nThe Splat Zone makes up most of the middle, in between the two raised areas and underneath the grated middle. The layout is the same as in Turf War.\n\nThe Tower starts on top of the grated bridge. It goes into the raised areas before turning right and then forward again into the opposing team's side. It goes into the side route of the opposing team before reaching the goal. A ramp is added to allow access to the opposing team's side easier. The grated bridge connecting the opposing team's side and the raised area has been removed.\n\nThe Rainmaker starts at the center of the stage. The checkpoints are located after entering the opponents' base through the grated bridge, or to the right of the starting position. The goal is located on the first drop from the spawn area. A ramp is added to the right to allow access to the pedestal.\n\nFollowing version 6.1.0, the pedestal and checkpoint areas remain the same. The raised area to the right of the checkpoint now has an inkable wall and the uninkable car further up can now be climbed by an added inkable wall.\n\nThe Clam Basket is located on some grates on the first drop down from spawn, with a bump being added to help the player access it from below. Blocks are added to the left open area allowing another way to the basket.\n\nFollowing version 6.1.0, the blocks on the left were replaced by a ramp and the small ramp on each team's raised area from Rainmaker is present. These changes make access to the basket easier.\n\nMincemeat Metalworks was released with the launch of Splatoon 3.\n\nMincemeat Metalworks underwent a major renovation starting with version 6.1.0.\n\nChanges include:\n\n- A small amount of the right immediate spawn area has been removed, and the platform one level down from spawn has been extended a little to the right and has a new extension on the left side.\n\n- One of the grates in the spawn area has been changed into a ramp.\n\n- Various ramps have been added throughout the stage.\n\n- The car poles have been changed into a set of boxes that function as a cover.\n\n- The snipe area now feature more covers than before.\n\n- The central area is significantly wider.\n\n- A small pillar and a pole has been added at the center of the stage.\n\nMincemeat Metalworks was available in the following Splatfests as a Tricolor Turf War stage in Splatoon 3:\n\n- Dark Chocolate vs. Milk Chocolate vs. White Chocolate (2023)\n\n- Shiver vs. Frye vs. Big Man\n\n- Past vs. Present vs. Future\n\n- Wizard vs. Knight vs. Ninja\n\n- Dark Chocolate vs. Milk Chocolate vs. White Chocolate (2025)\n\n- — Fixed an issue where part of a player's model would clip into certain terrain.\n\n- — Fixed an issue where players could unintentionally climb on top of certain terrain at the edge of the stage.\n\n- — Fixed an issue in Rainmaker mode where the DON'T RETREAT! warning would be shown at a shorter distance than intended.\n\n- — Changed the terrain for some modes and reduced the impact of weapons shooting from far away.\nTurf War\nSplat Zones\nRainmaker\nClam Blitz\n\n- Turf War\n\n- Splat Zones\n\n- Rainmaker\n\n- Clam Blitz\n\n- — Fixed an issue in Clam Blitz where clams were not placed symmetrically at the start of a battle.\n\n- Turf War\n\n- Splat Zones\n\n- Rainmaker\n\n- Clam Blitz\n\n- — Fixed an issue that allowed players to stay on top of grates in certain areas while in swim form.\n\n- — Fixed an issue that sometimes allowed shots to pass through the terrain when fired at where it met certain walls.\n\n- — Fixed an issue in Tower Control mode that allowed players to enter the tower from above in an unintended location.\n\n- — The terrain in Mincemeat Metalworks has been changed in all modes.\n\n- Version 2.1.0 introduced a bug where certain objects in the Tricolor Turf War layout would be invisible to the players,[1] while the collision was still there. Version 2.1.1 fixed the issue in preparation for the first Dark Chocolate vs. Milk Chocolate vs. White Chocolate Splatfest,[2] despite not yet being playable in-game before then.\n\n- Turf War\n\n- Splat Zones\n\n- Tower Control\n\n- Rainmaker\n\n- Clam Blitz\n\n- Tricolor Turf War\n\n- Turf War\n\n- Splat Zones\n\n- Rainmaker\n\n- Clam Blitz\n\n- Turf War\n\n- Splat Zones\n\n- Tower Control\n\n- Rainmaker\n\n- Clam Blitz\n\n- Mincemeat Metalworks as seen in promotional material.\n\n- A Splash Wall in Mincemeat Metalworks.\n\n- The bridge in the middle.\n\n- The Crust Bucket being scrapped on the Bravo side.\n\n- The map in Tricolor Turf War from above.\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Mincemeat_Metalworks_promotional_video.mp4\n\n\nPromotional Video (link to file)\n\n- This is one of the seven stages available to play in the Splatoon 3 Splatfest World Premiere.\n\n- The Crust Bucket can be seen on the Bravo side, having apparently been scrapped at some point prior to Crusty Sean starting Wandercrust.[5]"
