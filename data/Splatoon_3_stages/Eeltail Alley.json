    "Eeltail Alley is a multiplayer stage in Splatoon 3. It takes place in an alley which crosses an artificial island, surrounded by apartment buildings on the edge of Splatsville. It is one of the stages that can have Tricolor Turf Wars.",
    "Eeltail Alley is set in an alley at the edge of Splatsville with various buildings on one side and a monorail above. The Splatlands can be seen on the other side of the stage. Various bridges placed around the stage give it a separate upper and lower layer. There are many sponges spread across the map.",
    "In Ranked Battles, specifications for the terrain or placement of objects are different between the modes; these changes create new paths or new objects to take cover behind.",
    "The Splat Zone is located in the middle, being almost as wide as the entire stage. The uninkable walls have been shortened slightly to allow easier access across the middle of the stage. The bridge's middle section is removed, making access to the other team's side harder. The Bumper in the middle of the stage is replaced with a short, diagonal uninkable wall.",
    "The middle of the bridge is removed and a raised block replaces it. The Tower starts on the raised block then moves forward, to the right slightly, then forward again. It then goes left, then forward towards the uninkable path before reaching the goal. The middle of each team's bridge, which connects the left side to the middle section, is removed.",
    "The middle of the bridge is lowered and diagonal to the bridge. The Rainmaker starts on the lowered section of the bridge. The checkpoints are located forward of the bridge and in the middle of the open area in the middle of each team's side. The goal is located on the first drop of each team's spawn. The sponge to the left of the stage is replaced with a ramp and an uninkable ramp is added on the other side of the left area, allowing access from the other side.",
    "The Clam Baskets are located in the middle of each team's side, similar to the first checkpoint in Rainmaker. The bridge is similar to its Rainmaker layout.",
    "Eeltail Alley was released with the launch of Splatoon 3.",
    "Eeltail Alley was available in the following Splatfests as a Tricolor Turf War stage in Splatoon 3:",
    "- Money vs. Fame vs. Love",
    "- Shiver vs. Frye vs. Big Man",
    "- Bread vs. Rice vs. Pasta",
    "- Past vs. Present vs. Future",
    "- Money vs. Experiences vs. Presents",
    "Since the Bread vs. Rice vs. Pasta Splatfest, gushers have been in the Tricolor Turf War layout of the stage that were not present in either Money vs. Fame vs. Love or Shiver vs. Frye vs. Big Man.",
    "Eeltail Alley was the site of the sixth Big Run event in Fresh Season 2024. Like most Big Run stages, Eeltail Alley's Big Run layout features Grizzco-branded boxes that enable vertical movement, though to a lesser degree than some other stages. Uniquely, the water level does not change between tides due to it being positioned far below the stage normally, meaning Salmonids can only enter the stage through gushers. The stage features ten such gushers, with three each being active on high and low tides and four being active on normal tide. The bridge in the center of the stage is \"broken\" like in certain Anarchy Battle layouts, with grate platforms replacing parts that are solid ground in the original layout.",
    "High tide takes place at Team Bravo's spawn with the Egg Basket situated in the middle of the spawn area, normal tide takes place in the center of the stage with the Basket positioned in the exact middle of the stage, and low tide taking place at Team Alpha's spawn with the Egg Basket placed on one corner of the platform down the \"alleyway\" out of starting area. As with all Big Run stages, the Egg Basket's hitbox is extended downward due to its placement on a raised platform during low tide. All Known Occurrences that can take place during Big Runs may occur.",
    "During the Return of the Mammalians trailer, a different version of Eeltail Alley was used, which had many changes compared to the final version.",

    "- In the lobby, there is a chalk drawing of half of the stage located behind the ramp near the moving bumpers. It is labeled, and appears to be a strategy plan.",
    "- There are a few traffic cones scattered around the stage. When hit by players, they move and fade after a couple seconds.",
    "- Eeltail Alley is the only stage during Big Run and in Salmon Run Next Wave in general whose layout does not change between the tides due to the water level never being above the ground.",
    "- The large skyscraper in the middle of Splatsville can be seen from this stage.",
    "- Eeltail Alley's name in Dutch is the same as Urchin Underpass's name in the Dutch version of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.",
    "Eeltail Alley may be named after the Eeltail catfish, a catfish native to eastern Australia."
