    "Marlin Airport is a multiplayer stage in Splatoon 3. It takes place on the airfield of a large airport, with several airplanes visible parked and taking off in the background. The stage features Propellervators, similar to Ancho-V Games from Splatoon and Splatoon 2.",
    "The Spawn region of the stage is on a long platform that goes far to the right. One drop down leads to another area with a section on the right that leads to a drop to the middle of the stage or to the far right side of the stage. The left side has an inkrail and a propeller that both lead to a raised area on the left of the spawn. A courtyard is in the center of the spawn region with an uninkable ramp leading deeper into the spawn region and a sponge to the raised area on the left. The center of the stage is fairly open with many boxes and bumpers as cover. A Propeller section that raises leads to the other team's courtyard or to access the grates on a pillar next to it. Around the center is also a propeller that moves forward with a small area to the left of it with a box to access the propeller and a wall to return to the center of the stage.",
    "In Ranked Battles, specifications for the terrain or placement of objects are different between the modes; these changes create new paths or new objects to take cover behind.",
    "The Splat Zone is a small square located in the center of the stage, in between the fan areas. The stage is unchanged from Turf War.",
    "The Tower starts in the center replacing the stacks of boxes normally there, with blocks being added around the tower. It goes to the right then straight, next to the fan area and raised platform then turns left and goes up. The tower then goes up to the left of the opponents spawn then towards it to get to the goal. The right of the opponents spawn has been changed, adding a ramp and replacing the sponge with an inkable wall. The fan closest to each team's spawn is now much smaller along with a long platform next to it for the Tower. The uninkable ramp leading up to the opponent's base has been removed and a sponge is added there. The grated overlook at the center of the stage is removed.",
    "The Rainmaker starts on the top of the boxes. The checkpoint is right next to the starting position, on the fan area. Once a checkpoint is claimed, the fan will pop out and a new fan will also appear on the far right of the middle. The right of the opponents side is similar to in Tower Control but the uninkable ramp returns, allowing two ways to the pedestal, which is closest to the opponents spawn one drop from it. The fan closest to each team's spawn is its original layout and the sponge next to each team's spawn is removed. Rainmaker Free zones are added on the far sides of the center.",
    "The Clam Basket is located on the small pit of each team's spawn, right after dropping from the middle fan. The layout is similar to in Rainmaker, but the box on the far side of the center is removed, preventing access from there to the fan.",
    "Marlin Airport debuted in Splatoon 3 as part of the Fresh Season 2024.",
    "Marlin Airport is named after the marlin, a fish in the family Istiophoridae.",
