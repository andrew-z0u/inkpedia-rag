    "Crableg Capital is a multiplayer stage in Splatoon 3. It is set in a skyscraper area that is under construction. It is one of the stages that can have Tricolor Turf Wars.",
    "Similar to the Splatoon incarnation of Hammerhead Bridge, the stage heavily features grates as ways to travel the stage, along with a lower area that remains inkable. The spawn region is a wide platform with grates on the left. The area near includes the middle which leads to the grated bridge, slightly to the right which is slightly lower than the ground next to it, and the left which leads lower and has an inkrail leading up to the middle of the bridge. The right side has a grate overlook on the right and towards the center, along with a drop to the right of it leading to the center of the stage. The center of the stage is very wide and open, with it having slightly lower elevation on the left. Over the middle of the stage is a large grate bridge being the only way to access the opponent's spawn. The bridge goes to the right then straight into the base. Halfway through it is an inkable platform. There is inkable ground underneath the entire grated bridge.",
    "In Ranked Battles, specifications for the terrain or placement of objects are different between the modes; these changes create new paths or new objects to take cover behind.",
    "The Zone is located underneath the center grated bridge. Aside from a block for cover being added, it is unchanged from Turf War.",
    "The Tower starts in the center of the stage on the ground, with small ramps leading up to it. It moves forward towards the opponent's high ground and then moves diagonally backwards toward the grate bridge. It then goes up to the bridge then crosses it to the goal. The grate bridge has been changed, with a middle part cut from the center grate and the ones leading up to the raised block being removed. The ones leading up to the opponent's spawn has part of the grates made to uninkable ground and it leading to inkable ground quicker. The left side of each team's spawn has been changed to it leading to high ground while not going as far, with the inkrail still present.",
    "The Rainmaker starts in the center of the stage. The checkpoints are located on the small pit ahead of the starting position or to the right on the raised block. The goal is to the left of the spawn area. There are two ways to get to the pedestal: Going the normal way through the grate bridge or by jumping from the checkpoint to the small pit of each team's spawn and going to the goal. The grate bridge and the raised block has been slightly expanded with another block allowing players to go to the pedestal without needing the bridge. The left side is similar to in Tower Control.",
    "The Clam Basket is located in the small pit of each team's spawn. A block is added where the checkpoint is in Rainmaker allowing the same route and an extra ramp has been added allowing quicker access to the basket. The layout is similar to in Rainmaker.",
