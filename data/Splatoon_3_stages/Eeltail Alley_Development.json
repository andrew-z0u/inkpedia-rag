  "content": "Eeltail Alley features in both the Return of the Mammalians trailer and the Release Date Revealed trailer of Splatoon 3. As with other stages shown before the game's release, the stage's design has changed between the two trailers. Overall, it appears the stage appears narrower in the latter trailer; some of these changes are outlined below but are best observed in the aforementioned videos.\n\nBackground\n\n- The stage is now surrounded by water, excluding the middle area\n\n- Concrete and metal fences have been changed to construction fences\n\nSpawn area\n\n- Two-tiered 'house' structure is moved from the left of the map to the right\nThe addition of a short un-inkable path next to this structure\n\n- The addition of a short un-inkable path next to this structure\n\n- Several changes to access paths to the new platform configuration: ramps and sponges moved\n\n- Addition of elevated grates that the bow user traverses in the early part of the Release Date Revealed trailer\n\n- The addition of a short un-inkable path next to this structure\n\nAccess to the footbridge and elevated path\n\n- Each end of this bridge used to have three ramps leading up to it. The two ramps on the right-hand side (when looking from spawn) have been replaced by vertical inkable surfaces\n\nFootbridge and elevated path\n\n- The remaining ramp to the bridge has a short wall on the side facing the enemy spawn area\n\n- Grates have been added to the footbridge\n\nBelow the footbridge\n\n- A small section of the bridge where the removed ramps met has also been removed. As of the latter trailer, solid walls occupy the open space that was previously present\nThe small bumper below the lamppost pinpoints this altered area\n\n- The small bumper below the lamppost pinpoints this altered area\n\n- The small bumper below the lamppost pinpoints this altered area\n\nCenter of the stage\n\n- The mountable red and white barriers below the footbridge have been replaced with a wide bumper\n\n- The graffitied gray walls on the outer edge of the map have been brought inwards to abut the pair of blue vending machines\nThis removes an access path around the outside of the short wall that runs perpendicular to these outer walls\nThe short wall can now be mounted using an inkable block.\n\n- This removes an access path around the outside of the short wall that runs perpendicular to these outer walls\n\n- The short wall can now be mounted using an inkable block.\n\n- The raised octagonal surfaces near these short walls have been replaced with smaller blocks and moved towards the center\n\n- This removes an access path around the outside of the short wall that runs perpendicular to these outer walls\n\n- The short wall can now be mounted using an inkable block."
