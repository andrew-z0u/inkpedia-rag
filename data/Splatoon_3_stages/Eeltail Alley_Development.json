    "Eeltail Alley features in both the Return of the Mammalians trailer and the Release Date Revealed trailer of Splatoon 3. As with other stages shown before the game's release, the stage's design has changed between the two trailers. Overall, it appears the stage appears narrower in the latter trailer; some of these changes are outlined below but are best observed in the aforementioned videos."
