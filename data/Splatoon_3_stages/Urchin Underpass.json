    "Urchin Underpass is a multiplayer stage in Splatoon and Splatoon 3.",
    "Urchin Underpass consists of two large L-shaped areas of land that are joined together by a rectangular piece of land between them. It takes place below a highway.",
    "The spawn point of Urchin Underpass is fairly complicated despite being a usually neglected area. It is a large, enclosed area with several slopes descending to the lower floor, as well as grates leading away from it. The area around the spawn is a high, wide level with railings surrounding the edges, and the only way up is through the winding ramp situated at the corner in front of the spawn point. The spawn point area is accessible to the enemy team. The spiral ramp also has a walkway that leads to an alternate entrance into the main arena.",
    "Dropping down to the lower floor, the path toward the center of the map splits. One is an elevated path partially protected by railings and hard to reach for the enemy team, while the other is behind a grated wall that squids and ink can easily pass through, but solid objects like bombs cannot. A pillar juts out where the split paths converge and is tall enough that only players from the upper level can jump to. Beyond the pillar is a steep ramp leading to a side area that functions as the team's battlements. There are large patches of uninkable ground as well as two openings that make for popular sniper outposts. The opening that is closer to the middle has an inkable wall so that anyone from below can swim up to it.",
    "A large multilayered hill marks the entrance to the center, while a narrow alley runs beside it. At the end of the alley is a small flat square, and beyond that is the front lines where shots are traded, which has a ramp for daring jumps into enemy territory, a wall for cover and two ramps leading down into the gorge between either team's concrete platforms. The platform walls are all inkable, allowing for surprise attacks from within the gorge. Two trees are placed at either end of the gorge for cover. There are no hazards in this stage.",
    "In Ranked Battles, specifications for the terrain or placement of objects are different between the modes; these changes create new paths or new objects to take cover behind.",
    "The Splat Zone in Urchin Underpass is located at the very center of the map. It is the smallest singular Splat Zone in Splatoon, so gaining and staying in control requires lots of attention to it. Boxes have been added near both ends of the Splat Zone to protect from enemy fire and a vantage point to attack the Splat Zone.",
    "In Splatoon 3 the Splat Zone remains in the same location. An Inkrail was added to the far left of the stage. The walls seperating the side alley and the entrance to the center of the stage were replaced with an inkable platform connected to the side alley, making that area more open.",
    "In Tower Control, the Tower starts in the center plaza. It moves straight back towards the enemy territory and climbs up, then moves to the rider's left, climbs back down, and reaches the goal. An inkable wall was added to the opponent's flank on the left of the center of the stage.",
    "In Splatoon 3 the Tower path remains mostly the same. Instead of going to the far left of the opponent's spawn, the goal is located in front of each team's spawn, with the tower turning forward once it gets to each team's pit. The side alleys now go slight lower when getting close to the center and the inkable platform in Splat Zones is present. The inkable wall that allowed access to the opponent's flank was removed.",
    "The Rainmaker in Urchin Underpass is located in the center of the stage, just below the two ramps in the center. The goal is at the end of the small strip of land with four stripes in front of the opposing team's base. Two stacks of blocks have been added to help both teams get to the center of the map faster.",
    "In Splatoon 3, the Rainmaker starts at the center of the stage. Ramps and blocks have been added to make the center of the stage level with the other ground around it. The checkpoint is located at the top of the small hill to enter the opponent's spawn. The goal is located at the same location with the ground around it more closely resembling the Splatoon variant. The sponge located in each team's pit has been replaced with an inkable wall, allowing both team's to reach the high ground quicker. An inkable block was added next to the platform allowing access to there. The side alley and a small corridor near the small hill are blocked off from access from the center.",
    "The Clam Basket is located in front of each team's spawn area, accessible to clams by the pit. The vertical grates next to it were moved back and the ramp next to the platform behind it were removed, making the pit more open. Other than this, the layout is most similar to the Turf War layout.",
    "Urchin Underpass underwent a series of changes between its development period and release. It is also used in Octo Valley mission #21, Unwelcome Flying Object, as well as the Battle Dojo in the released version of it.",
    "The earliest designed version of Urchin Underpass has been seen in a screenshot from when the game still used rabbits as the design for the player characters. The center of the stage is very similar to the E3 and release versions of Urchin Underpass.",
    "The pre-release version included many differences, such as:",
    "- A water tank guarded by a fence could be found in the corner of teams' bases.",
    "- The raised platform opposite the spawn points in the teams' bases was accessed by one smaller ramp, included a wooden plank used to swim up through a grated platform, and did not provide access to the Center Plaza.",
    "- The lowest area in teams' bases was much larger.",
    "- When leaving a team's spawn point and heading left, the first ramp encountered was not present. Instead, players could go around the raised portion on either side. This raised portion was split into three differently-sized platforms, and a window was not present in this location.",
    "- The walls of the secret alleys were concrete, not glass.",
    "- When entering the center plaza from the main entrance, a small fence acting as a grated barrier was present on players' immediate left.",
    "- The ramped platforms allowing players to jump to the other side of the center plaza were directly opposite each other.",
    "- The middle area in the center plaza was slightly smaller.",
    "- The grated walkways outside the secret alleys in the center plaza were extended.",
    "- A team's base.",
    "- The center plaza.",
    "- The three platforms near teams' bases.",
    "- The water tower and smaller raised area.",
    "In this version, the center of the stage is almost the same as in the E3 version, but each side's base was changed completely, from removing grates and high platforms to ramps and high advantage points.",
    "There are two alleys located near the central plaza. They are long, narrow, hidden-away strips of turf that are difficult to access which have two glass panels.",
    "It is still possible to play the pre-update Urchin Underpass in Battle Dojo.",
    "On 27 July 2015, the official Splatoon Tumblr announced that Urchin Underpass would be undergoing maintenance between 2 and 5 August 2015. They released an image showing the original map scribbled on, allowing fans to see what about the stage would be changed. Many features were altered, including:",
    "- The trees near each team's base were moved to the center of the stage.",
    "- The secret alleys were extended and pushed further away from the central area. They were also widened and given another access point to the center area.",
    "- The grated walkways protruding from the secret alleys were removed.",
    "- The ramps leading into the central area were made so that they only took up half of the available space. The other half became flat turf.",

    "Urchin Underpass appears as a battle course in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. This version of the stage features much more open areas for players to drive in and purple and green ink splatters on the ground that decrease the traction of vehicles driving in them. Additionally, the grates leading to the side alleys are raised so that they can be driven under. The background is also altered, such as graffiti of Tanooki Mario being added to a wall and one of the background skyscrapers being replaced with Inkopolis Tower. On this course, the Item Box roulette sound effect is replaced by the ability reroll sound from Splatoon, and in the Renegade Roundup and Coin Runners modes, coins are replaced by cash. Jellyfish appear as spectators in the background of the course. A rendition of Splattack! is used as the course's main music, and in the final minute of the battle, the music switches to Now or Never! (unlike in other courses, where the music simply increases in speed and pitch in the final minute).",
    "- Urchin Underpass is the only stage in Splatoon that was changed almost completely after being released.",
    "- Near the center area is an inaccessible, L-shaped space, which can be seen by standing on the vending machine in the corner. The floor and walls are fully textured to match the rest of the stage, but the floor is not solid; sub weapons thrown in are never heard landing.",
    "- The utility poles featured in the teams' bases are decorated with various license plates, many adorned with the Splash Mob and Forge logos. It is unknown what purpose these license plates serve.\nBefore version 2.0.0, two utility poles in the center of the stage featured the same license plates, but with Shrimp Kicks and Krak-On advertising instead. They were removed in the update.",
    "- Urchin Underpass's design and Japanese name are based on Jūjō-dōri (十条通, lit. Tenth Road) in Kyoto, near which Nintendo's headquarters are located.",
    "- In Splatoon 3, one of Deep Cut's dialogues about the stage references one of the Squid Sisters' dialogues from the first game. Frye, like Callie, talks about securing the central area, while Shiver, like Marie, thinks it is better to stage an attack from the alleys.",
    "- In Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Urchin Underpass shares its Dutch name with Eeltail Alley. It was later renamed in the Dutch version of Splatoon 3.",
    "\"Urchin\" can relate to both a slang term referring to someone dirty and poor, as well as sea urchins, spiny sea creatures. \"Underpass\" is a passageway for passengers and cyclists beneath a road or railway, allowing them to reach the other side in safety."
