Leading from each team's spawn point, players can either jump straight down into the accessible battlefield, head left to immediately face a Inkrail which takes them closer to the center of the stage, or head right up a ramp to the far-right side. After dropping down, a large wall provides coverage and a vantage point for the team which cannot be accessed from the other side. Players can either head to the open path to the left which enemies can enter through, or up the barricade or ramps to gain a vantage point. The center portion of the stage features a raised area with two large obstacles on each side with a box in the center. Two narrow hallways line the outer side of this area, with inkable walls to get directly back to the center. To each team's right is a bit of open space with a ramp. Due to having a direct open path to the center, MakoMart facilitates a quick pace.\n\nIn Ranked Battles, specifications for the terrain or placement of objects are different between the modes; these changes create new paths or new objects to take cover behind.\n\nThe Splat Zone is located at the center of the stage and consists of all the area between the two main blocks. The spawn point for each team has been moved to the wider platform to the right of the original spawn point. Notable changes to the stage layout include an expansion to the raised area to each team's immediate left as well as sponges added at ground level. Minor blocks have been added and removed, and the center block in the Splat Zones is removed, replaced with a wide bumper.\n\nThe Tower is located at the center of the stage in place of the original box. The spawn point is roughly in the same place as in Splat Zones, though pushed back a bit more. The Tower travels towards the enemy's side before going down the ramp to its left, then raising shortly before traveling right to the entrance to the enemy base. It then travels a bit further and reaches the goal, which is just past the opening.\n\nThe Rainmaker is located at the center of the stage on top of the block. The position of the spawn point is radically different, being on the immediate left of the Turf Wars spawn point, just before the Inkrail, with the area raised even more than normal. The goals are located at the same location of the spawn point in Turf Wars with a large slope to make the area accessible. The main two options to get to the goal is either through the normally accessible open path to each team's left or on the other side. An inkable block has been added to allow players to enter into the opposing team's base through the upper route.\n\nThe baskets are located just on the opposing sides of the center raised area on the uninkable surface with a bump added. The spawn point is in the same location as it is in Tower Control. An inkable block is added to the left to allow players to jump to the same layer as the basket. An inkable ramp is also added to the right to make getting to the basket easier.\n\nIn the Tricolor Turf War variant of MakoMart the whole spawn area was changed with the left side of the spawn almost missing completely, only adding a platform, where the Out-of-bounds area normally is, as a spawn for the defending team. The right side, which functions as a spawn for the attacking teams, is somewhat similar to the original variant, only leveling the terrain to be flatter than before. On the middle level of the right side a Sponge was added and the ramp that normally goes down, instead goes up. The block that is added in different other modes like Rainmaker is also present. On the lower area of the right side some blocks were added to make getting into the middle easier and in the middle it self a pedestal for the Ultra Signal was added, the rest of the stage is unchanged.\n\nMakoMart was released on 25 November 2017 at 02:00 UTC.\n\n- Fixed an issue on MakoMart in which if a certain wall was hit with a bomb, ink would splash onto a nearby wall that players were occasionally unable to submerge into.\n\n- Fixed an issue on MakoMart in which a certain railing could be seen through by pulling the camera close to it.\n\n- Slightly adjusted the tower path in Tower Control on MakoMart in order to fix a rare issue in which the player could be sandwiched between the tower and terrain, causing them to be pushed inside the terrain.\n\n- Adjusted the direction of the turf map on MakoMart to display the Alpha team's start point on the left-hand side of the screen as like other maps.\n\n- Changed the location of some Inkrails in Rainmaker on MakoMart making it so that they cannot be used to carry the Rainmaker to a high platform in your team's base.\n\n- Turf War\n\n- Splat Zones\n\n- Tower Control\n\n- Rainmaker\n\n- Clam Blitz\n\n- Two Inklings in a Turf War at MakoMart.\n\n- An Inkling boy looking around MakoMart.\n\n- An Inkling boy holding a Carbon Roller at MakoMart.\n\n- Many Inklings shopping at MakoMart.\n\n- MakoMart during a Splatfest.\n\n- Turf War (Splatfest) icon for MakoMart.\n\nMakoMart returns in Splatoon 3 with a slightly new design.

Low poly Off the Hook branded ice creams can also be found in the freezer, along with a Pearl magazine in the exterior battle area.\n\n- MakoMart is the only stage with the spawn points placed in four different locations: only Clam Blitz and Tower Control share spawn locations.\n\n- This stage and Goosponge are the only stages with one word in the name.\n\n- The same circular panel above the center of the stage can also be seen in C08 Right Round Station, but with a Kamabo Corporation logo across the top.\n\nMakoMart is a reference to the genus Isurus, known as mako sharks."
