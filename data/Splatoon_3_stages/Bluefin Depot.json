    "Bluefin Depot is a multiplayer stage in Splatoon and Splatoon 3. It is an abandoned coal mine with railway track above it. A river splits the stage down the middle, with the spawn areas connecting the left and right paths. In Splatoon 3, the abandoned coal mine has since been turned into a museum.[1] It is one of the stages that can have Tricolor Turf Wars.",
    "Bluefin Depot is an abandoned coal mine consisting of four different levels, the two uppermost of which can only be accessed by the enemy team by grated walkways. The lowest level is divided by a body of water and requires traversing the third level to switch sides. It consists of two platforms that are separated from each other by a small body of water that cannot be jumped over. The level allows players to travel between both sides of the stage. Each team's base is comprised of two levels. The spawn point is located on the top level; it can only be reached via a grated walkway in the middle. The bottom level is where players can get to the different sides of the stage and can only be reached by a grated walkway on the opposing team's right.",
    "Bluefin Depot received several changes in Splatoon 3. The spawn region has been changed drastically moving it mostly to the right and removing most grated areas. The spawn region is a platform with it going down a layer and then going to the left or straight. This layer is accessible with a ramp. The area in between the spawn and middle has been widened and separated between the left and right with a wall. The wall has a ramp on the right but the left is only traversable with a block. The far left of the stage was replaced with a small grate platform. The center of the stage is mostly unchanged with the only difference being that the ramps that appear in some ranked modes are present in all modes.",
    "In Ranked Battles, specifications for the terrain or placement of objects are different between the modes; these changes create new paths or new objects to take cover behind.",
    "The Splat Zone in Bluefin Depot can be found on the side that is closest to the ocean. Two ramps leading towards the Splat Zone are located on the other side of the stage. Walls have also been added on both sides of the stage. Blocks have also been added to the bottom level of the bases and to the lower level to even the ramp located on each side.",
    "In Splatoon 3 the Splat Zone is located on a newly added platform in the center of the stage. Once the zone is claimed, the platform will move to the side closest to the opponents. The walls on each side now come up when the zone is on the opposite side and retract when the zone is on that side. The left side of each team's raised platform now expands further along with an inkable wall for opponents as another way to enter their side.",
    "In Tower Control, the Tower starts in the center, above the water and can be accessed by an added bridge. Once claimed, it moves to the right and up the walls. Then, it crosses over to the left side and continues up until it reaches the goal. Inkable blocks are added to the uninkable block on the left of the spawn point.",
    "In Splatoon 3 the Tower starts on a newly added bridge in the center of the stage. When traveling, it goes left, then up towards the very left of the stage. It then goes forward to the goal. The ramps in the middle of the stage has been reversed to drop off to the right side and grates are also added to make accessing the tower from the center easier.",
    "The Rainmaker is located in the middle of the stage. The control points are directly in front of the spawn points on each side. In this mode, there have been a few changes to the map, most notably the middle where the weapon is located. There are pathways, as well as a platform where the Rainmaker sits and ramps that allow players to easily move between the two sides of the stage. A box and grated walkway leading up to this section are added on the left.",
    "In Splatoon 3 the checkpoints are located on the low ground from the left of the Rainmaker starting position and on the high ground in the open area to the right after the elevator, replacing a block normally there. The pedestal is on the open area right next to spawn. The ramp leading up to it has been replaced by an uninkable staircase and another ramp is added next to the checkpoint on the high ground. The left side has the platform added in Splat Zones with the wall near it being shrunken, allowing another way to the checkpoint.",
    "The Clam Basket is located on the first drop from spawn, closer to the edge of the area. The center of the stage is similar to in Tower Control and the areas on the left of the spawn area are added.",
    "Following version 8.0.0, An inkrail was added to the walls on the left side of the middle that leads to the opponent's raised area on the left. Grates were also added around this area and part of the wall was cut off. The block on the right side of the opponent's side was changed to be inkable on all sides and a small uninkable block was added next to it. These changes make access to the basket easier.",
    "Bluefin Depot was made available on 20 June 2015 at 02:00 UTC.[2][3]",
    "Bluefin Depot was available in the following Splatfests in Splatoon:",
    "Bluefin Depot returns in Splatoon 3 as part of the Chill Season 2023. Major changes have been made to the spawn region, and elevators replace inkable walls as another way to traverse the stage. It is also one of the stages that can have Tricolor Turf Wars.",
    "Bluefin Depot was available in the following Splatfests as a Tricolor Turf War stage in Splatoon 3:",
    "Bluefin Depot is a reference to the bluefin tuna.",

    "- Evening and night variants of this map exist in Octo Valley, in the missions Octoling Uprising and Undeniable Flying Object, respectively.\nAt the end of Undeniable Flying Object, after the Octostriker has been defeated and the music stops, some unusual sounds can be heard: an erratic clanking and a faint moan, which are slightly louder towards the edge of the UFO. These sounds could also be heard when using Recon to explore Bluefin Depot during a Splatfest. Given Callie's comments on the stage, they may be the result of paranormal happenings or simply the deterioration of old structures.",
