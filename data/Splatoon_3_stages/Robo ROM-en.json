The right path from the drop from spawn leads to the center of the stage at the same relative elevation. The left path from the drop from spawn leads down to the lower court, with a ramp and several inkable walls directly leading to the center. The defining feature of the stage is the paths from each court that pass underneath the main path to the center, leading to the court on the other side.\n\nIn Ranked Battles, specifications for the terrain or placement of objects are different between the modes; these changes create new paths or new objects to take cover behind.\n\nThe Splat Zone takes up most of the middle of the map. The stage is unchanged from Turf War.\n\nThe Tower starts on the center of the map, replacing the bumper normally there. From there, it goes to the left then down into the lower section. It then goes through it then goes forward onto the goal on the raised ground of the opponents. The entrance to the opponents area has been changed drastically, now having a grate bridge leading into it. An inkrail has been added near the bridge. The lower section has been expanded along with a wall on the side leading to the upper section. The area on the right of each team's spawn region has been shortened slightly. Obstacles near the goal have been changed slightly.\n\nThe Rainmaker starts in the center of the stage. The checkpoints are located on the open area straight ahead, or to the left. The goal is located one drop from spawn. A ramp has been added for access. Grates have been added on the other side of the wall near the center, allowing easier movement around the center. An inkrail is also added on the bottom section to allow quicker movement between the two elevations. An uninkable box has also been added, allowing a new route from the right of the stage. The right of spawn is the same as in Tower Control.\n\nThe Clam Basket is found on the rightmost side, one drop from spawn. The layout is similar to in Rainmaker but the ramp leading up to the opponent's spawn and the inkrail were removed. A block also replaces the bumper in the center.\n\nRobo ROM-en debuted in Splatoon 3 as part of the Chill Season 2023.\n\nRobo ROM-en was available in the following Splatfests as a Tricolor Turf War stage in Splatoon 3:\n\n- Same Ol' vs. Bucket List vs. Save the Day\n\n- Past vs. Present vs. Future\n\n- Morning vs. Afternoon vs. Night\n\n- Turf War\n\n- Splat Zones\n\n- Tower Control\n\n- Rainmaker\n\n- Clam Blitz\n\n- Tricolor Turf War\n\nThe restaurant Robo ROM-en has a theme song which plays in the background of the stage, as well as at a ramen stall on the Grand Festival Grounds. A music video had been released, which features translated lyrics in Japanese.\n\n- A selfie taken by an Octoling at Robo ROM-en.\n\n- The bowl hanging from the ceiling glowing red during a Splatfest.\n\n- Cooking robots being watched by a jellyfish.\n\n- A large RBR-DGR graffiti on the underside of part of the stage.\n\n- Jellyfish eating at tables below the stage.\n\n- Overhead view of the stage's Tricolor Turf War layout.\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Robo_ROM-en_adverts.mp4\n\n\nThe content seen on the screens outside the stage (link to file)\n\n- The ramen bowl glows the color of the neutral team.\nThis glow is brighter during a Splatfest Battle.\n\n- This glow is brighter during a Splatfest Battle.\n\n- Just like with Manta Maria and Scorch Gorge, there is a place a player can get to using Zipcaster, this time being the big ramen bowl in the middle of the stage. The player can stand on the edge of the bowl, but not on the ramen itself.\n\n- Robo ROM-en has a booth on the Grand Festival Grounds.\n\n- This glow is brighter during a Splatfest Battle.\n\n- The booth at the Grand Festival Grounds.\n\nRobo ROM-en comes from robo (\"robot\") and \"ROM (read-only memory)\". ROM-en sounds like \"ramen\", a Japanese noodle dish served in a broth with various toppings; a bowl of ramen is also present on the stage.\n\nSome localizations have used RAM (random-access memory) instead of ROM for the same effect."
