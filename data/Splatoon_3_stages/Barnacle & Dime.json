    "Barnacle & Dime is a multiplayer stage in Splatoon 3. It is located inside a supercenter mall. It is also one of the stages that can have Tricolor Turf Wars. It was reworked on 30 May 2024.",
    "The spawn region is fairly wide with another drop down as the main spawn region. To the far right is a path that goes over an uninkable and then leads to some high ground allowing poking to the middle of the stage. Going straight leads to another drop going to a pit with a block allowing access to the spawn. The middle of the stage features a slightly lower area to the left as another way to enter the middle of the stage. Going straight leads to slightly higher ground with some forms of cover. The center of the stage features some uninkable blocks around the edges and an inkable diagonal box in the very center.",
    "Following Version 8.0.0, Barnacle and Dime received a substantial rework. The spawn region now features some new, uninkable high ground to the right of it. The glass bridge leading to it was changed to a wooden, inkable bridge and some small ramps and walls were added next to it. The small pit in each team's side features more ramps leading up to the ground next to it. The snipe area near it was expanded with more ground and a ramp leading up to it. A grate is also added to the left of it. The left of the snipe area has some newly added land lower than the ground next to it. This area has an uninkable pole and an inkable wall to approach the center of the stage. More obstacles were added throughout the stage. The center box also changed slightly, with small additions on each side.",
    "In Ranked Battles, specifications for the terrain or placement of objects are different between the modes; these changes create new paths or new objects to take cover behind.",
    "The Splat Zone is located in the center of the stage. The stage is unchanged.",
    "The Tower starts in the center of the stage, replacing the blocks normally there. From there, it goes left onto the raised area and then straight before turning left again onto the opponents raised area then straight to the goal. The raised areas on the right of the spawn have been shrunk, only going halfway as far and the ground next to the uninkable is around the same level as the uninkable. An inkrail has been added at the very end of this area.",
    "Following version 8.0.0 the Tower path was changed slightly. It now does not go onto each team's stack and instead goes to the side of it. The uninkable area to the right of each team's spawn area does not go as far and the inkable ground further out was extended to the right, with a new block and grate to the far right. The block leading up to the opponent's base has one side being uninkable and the wooden bridge being a glass one again. The checkpoints were also adjusted.",
    "The Rainmaker is located on the stack of blocks in the middle. The checkpoint is located behind the raised area in the middle, before entering the opponent's base. The stage is most similar to the Tower Control layout, except for adding more cover in spawn and an uninkable staircase allowing another way to the pedestal.",
    "The Clam Basket is located on each team's pit with a bump being added. The right side is similar to in Rainmaker but the box and grate is there next to the uninkable. The small pieces of cover is replaced by the Clam Basket and the Sponge from Tower Control is present.",
    "Following version 8.0.0, the bump to the Clam Basket and sponge were removed. A small ramp was added to make scoring clams easier. The center block was changed to a smaller, vertical box.",
    "Barnacle & Dime debuted in Splatoon 3 as part of the Sizzle Season 2023.",
    "Barnacle & Dime underwent a major renovation starting with version 8.0.0.",
    "Changes include:",
    "- A small amount of the right immediate spawn area has been extended and raised.",
    "- The walls on the left side after the immediate spawn area has been removed, and the grates there has been extended as well.",
    "- The glass bridge now has been turned into a wooden bridge.",
    "- The snipe area has been reworked and made wider than before.",
    "- A new lower area to the left of snipe was added. A grated platform was added from the back of the snipe area to the lower area, connected by a pole.",
    "- Various ramps and covers have been added throughout the stage.",
    "- The central structure has been reworked.",
    "Barnacle & Dime was available in the following Splatfests as a Tricolor Turf War stage in Splatoon 3:",

    "- Shiver vs. Frye vs. Big Man",
    "- Past vs. Present vs. Future",
    "Barnacle & Dime is the site of the fifth Big Run in Chill Season 2023. Its layout features many additional inkable blocks to provide extra vertical mobility. There are six gushers on the stage, of which three are active on low tide and two each are active on normal and high tides. Normal and high tides both take place in the middle of the stage with the Egg Basket in the exact middle of the stage, while low tide takes place at Team Alpha's spawn with the Egg Basket on a raised ledge near where players spawn in. The Egg Basket's hitbox is extended downward due to its placement on a tall platform during low tide. All Known Occurrences that can take place during Big Runs may occur.",

    "Barnacle & Dime is a pun on \"barnacle\", a type of aquatic arthropod, and \"nickel and dime\", which means charging a large amount of money over time by way of many small payments."
