It is located at the Grand Festival Grounds.[2]\n\nThe stage first became available during the Big Run on 7 September 2024.\n\n- 1 Splatoon 3\n\n1.1 Big Run\n\n1.1.1 Quota\n\n\n1.2 Tricolor Battle\n1.3 Maps\n\n- 1.1 Big Run\n\n1.1.1 Quota\n\n- 1.1.1 Quota\n\n- 1.2 Tricolor Battle\n\n- 1.3 Maps\n\n- 2 Gallery\n\n- 3 Quotes\n\n- 4 Trivia\n\n- 5 Etymology\n\n5.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 5.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 6 References\n\n- 1.1 Big Run\n\n1.1.1 Quota\n\n- 1.1.1 Quota\n\n- 1.2 Tricolor Battle\n\n- 1.3 Maps\n\n- 1.1.1 Quota\n\n- 5.1 Names in other languages\n\nSee the number on the electric board over there? That's the total number of Golden Eggs delivered by everyone helping out with this Big Run. If it hits the quota I set, all participants get a bonus set of fish scales. The quota is 700,000,000. Where did I get that number, you're wondering? Glad you asked. The great migration of salmon used to happen once every 70 years. But about two years ago, it started happening all over. This is the seventh site. And what do you get if you add seven zeros to 70? You get 700,000,000.\n\nSo there you have it. It's a big ask, but you have big skills. I'm already thinking about giving you all even more fish scales if you go enough over the quota. Now go out, form your crews, and make that number go up.\n\nThe Grand Splatlands Bowl was the site of the eighth Big Run event which took place from 7 September 2024 to 9 September 2024, the weekend before the Grand Festival. Unlike all other Big Runs, the only song that played during regular waves was Double Clickbait, with Not Bad (Catch Ya Better) being played during the results.\n\nDescribed by Grizzco as an urgent situation with the tagline \"Take back the Grand Festival venue!\", the Salmonids planned to attack the Grand Festival's venue as it is being built which may jeopardize the upcoming Splatfest event set to take place there.[2]\n\nThe Grand Splatlands Bowl Big Run event uniquely featured a global Golden Egg collection tally system. A scoreboard was visible in the Grizzco lobby, with a set goal of 700 million Golden Eggs to collect and award fish scales to all participants.[3] To help achieve this goal, Mr. Grizz set up his own personal modifications of Big Shot launchers around the stage specifically for delivering Golden Eggs; the ones that are closest to the egg basket automatically deliver the Golden Eggs themselves. Additionally, Goldies were able to spawn during regular waves, functioning in the same manner as they did during special Fog waves.\n\nThe weapon rotation for this event was a rare-weapon only rotation,[4] with the Triumvirate appearing for all Xtrawaves.\n\nThere are technically only two distinct water levels, but the tide markers indicate three distinct spawn and basket locations. At normal tide, the basket appears in the center of the stage, with gushers to spawn enemies appearing near each of the three \"wings\" of the stage (with the left and right wing connected by narrow bridges as well as one inkrail each). High tide features the same water level but the spawn and basket are moved to the right wing of the stage, with two inkrails connecting to the central area, two gushers in the center of the stage, and enemies spawning from the water. At low tide, the basket is moved to the center wing of the stage and wider low-lying areas between the right and left wing of the stage are exposed; gushers appear in two of these low-lying areas as well as on the central platform of the stage, and inkrails appear in the same locations as normal tide.\n\nThis Big Run event featured a unique globally tracked Golden Egg counter system; the current tally was visible in-game via the two signboards within the lobby. The initial quota revealed in the anarchy Splatcast in which this Big Run was announced was Â 700,000,000. Upon being met, the quota increased by one hundred million Golden Eggs; the quota was increased a total of three times, after which the signboard could no longer display the current tally live. With each quota increase the scoreboards became increasingly decorated.\n\nUnlike standard Splatfests, Tricolor Battle was available from the Grand Festival's start. The new Grand Splatlands Bowl stage was the last Tricolor Turf War stage, becoming the only available stage for the final 24 hours of the Splatfest.[1]\n\nIn the beginning of a battle, an announcer can be heard announcing the teams when players come out of their spawners, and in the \"Ready? Go!\" sequence.\n\nAfter a team captures the second Ultra Signal, the idols representing that team will appear on a stage in the background and cheer them on.[6] When the second Ultra Signal is secured, the standard second Sprinkler of Doom does not appear, in contrast to other Tricolor Battle stages. Instead, cannons affixed to the stage upon which the idols are performing will rhythmically shoot Fizzbangs in support of the team that secured the second Ultra Signal.\n\nUnlike standard Tricolor stages, the only battle song that plays on this stage is Rainbow Color Inkantation. During the match's final minute, the song will be supplemented by additional vocals by either the Squid Sisters, Off the Hook or Deep Cut depending on which team secured the second Ultra Signal, if applicable, replacing Now or Never!. If no team secured the second Ultra Signal, the song proceeds without vocals. If the second Ultra Signal is captured during the final minute, the song shifts instantaneously to the vocals and instrumentation of the team's idols.\n\nIn the center of the stage, there is a large pole the Ultra Signals spawn on. Standing on the terrain around the pole raises it to the same height as the pole, similar to Bluefin Depot's elevators. Only one player is needed for the ground to rise. The sides of the terrain that rises feature the same design of the tower in Tower Control, with LED lights scrolling multiple Turf War logos.\n\n- Tricolor Turf War\n\n- Grizzco's announcement of the Big Run.
