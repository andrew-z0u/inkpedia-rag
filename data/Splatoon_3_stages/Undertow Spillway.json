    "Undertow Spillway is a multiplayer stage in Splatoon 3. It is also one of the stages that can have Tricolor Turf Wars.",
    "Undertow Spillway is an abandoned underground flood bypass in Splatsville that was renovated into a Turf War stage. The spawn area features a wide area of turf that goes far to the right. The first drop is accessible to the other team via an uninkable ramp and goes also as far as the spawn area. The drop after that is an open area and to the left allows access to a raised area and an uninkable raised area. To the right of the open area is a small drop to another open area. The middle is two open areas separated by a wall in the middle.",
    "In Ranked Battles, specifications for the terrain or placement of objects are different between the modes; these changes create new paths or new objects to take cover behind.",
    "There are two Splat Zones, both located underneath the glass areas. An uninkable ramp is added to allow access to the opposing team's base.",
    "The Tower starts in the middle of the stage, replacing the bumper normally there. When advancing, the Tower goes left then straight, closer to the opposing team's side. It then goes right and continues going until it reaches the goal. The large glass areas in the middle are removed and a ramp is added in the middle of the opposing team's base.",
    "The Rainmaker is located in the middle of the stage, replacing the bumper normally there. The checkpoints are located in the open area to the right, and to the far left on the opponent's raised area. A ramp is added to the far left to allow access to the checkpoint. The pedestal is located on the first drop. The right of the spawn areas has been altered slightly, having an uninkable path being the only way to get to the pedestal. An Inkrail is added to the far right of the spawn.",
    "The Clam basket is located to the left of the spawn, two drops down. An uninkable ramp has been added just behind the basket to help access the platform behind it.",
    "Undertow Spillway was released with the launch of Splatoon 3.",
    "Undertow Spillway underwent a major renovation in version 7.2.0.",
    "Changes include:",
    "Undertow Spillway was available in the following Splatfests as a Tricolor Turf War stage in Splatoon 3:",
    "Undertow Spillway is where the third Big Run took place. Its layout adds many inkable blocks, plus ten gushers which the Salmonids use to enter the stage. Six Gushers are active at low tide, three at medium tide, and two at high tide. As usual, there are three tides; low tide takes place in the middle of the stage with the Egg Basket placed on the sloped ledge in the center, medium tide sets players on the raised area just outside of Team Alpha's spawn, and high tide sets players in the spawn area with the majority of the stage flooded. For this Big Run only, the Egg Basket's hitbox is expanded downward due to its placement on raised platforms across all tides. The only Known Occurrences that can occur on this stage are Fog, The Mothership, and Rush.",
