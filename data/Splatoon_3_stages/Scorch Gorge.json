The center of the stage contains a climbable platform connected with grates to other platforms.\n\nThe spawn points are small raised areas that goes to another raised area. Going left leads the player to another platform that goes far to the left of the user's spawn. The right leads the user to some more raised areas for defense. Going straight leads the user down to an open area that ramps back up near the middle. Once it goes up, there is a platform to the left and a block in the middle that the user can climb up. To the right is an area that either ramps up to the middle or can be jumped up to through a block. The middle of the stage is fairly open and has a large tower in the center with grates that go towards the right of the stage, leading to the opponent's platform.\n\nIn Ranked Battles, specifications for the terrain or placement of objects are different between the modes; these changes create new paths or new objects to take cover behind.\n\nThe Splat Zone is located in the middle of the stage, taking up most of the middle of the stage. The stage is unchanged.\n\nThe central platform is lowered compared to the Turf War version. The Tower starts on the platform, goes forward before turning right to the opposing team's left side. It then goes forward then left, then forward again until it reaches the goal. The left side of each team is now accessible by ramp and the grated pathway is now removed. The ramp to the left side is replaced with a climbable wall.\n\nThe layout is similar to the Tower Control layout, but with grates leading to the enemy team's side. The Rainmaker starts on the central tower. The checkpoints are located on the right of the starting position and after the central grates on the opponent's raised area. The goal is located after the first drop from spawn. The far left side of the spawn has been shortened, and the areas immediately behind each team's left checkpoint are expanded to the left.\n\nThe Clam baskets are located to the left of each team's raised block. The stage is similar to the Rainmaker layout. The only change is the area near the baskets being more flat instead of on a ramp and the center tower being its normal height.\n\nScorch Gorge was released with the launch of Splatoon 3.\n\nScorch Gorge was available in the following Splatfests as a Tricolor Turf War stage in Splatoon 3:\n\n- Power vs. Wisdom vs. Courage\n\n- Shiver vs. Frye vs. Big Man\n\n- Past vs. Present vs. Future\n\n- Wizard vs. Knight vs. Ninja\n\n- — Fixed an issue in Turf War, Splat Zones, and Clam Blitz battles where squeezing into the gap between certain terrain would cause the player to enter into the terrain.\n\n- — Fixed an issue in Turf War and Splat Zones modes that allowed you to climb over certain obstacles and cross terrain in unintended ways.\n\n- — Fixed an issue in Clam Blitz mode where clams were not placed symmetrically at the start of a battle.\n\n- — Adjusted some of the terrain to fix an issue in Turf War and Splat Zones modes that allowed players to Dodge Roll and enter the enemy base in an unintended way.\n\n- — Changed terrain in all modes.\n\n- Turf War\n\n- Splat Zones\n\n- Tower Control\n\n- Rainmaker\n\n- Clam Blitz\n\n- Tricolor Turf War\n\n- Turf War\n\n- Splat Zones\n\n- Tower Control\n\n- Rainmaker\n\n- Clam Blitz\n\n- An early version of Scorch Gorge, covered in yellow and blue ink.\n\n- Blaster and the new design of the Range Blaster.\n\n- An Inkling holding the Trizooka.\n\n- The Trizooka special weapon being fired (right), Tenta Missile-like projectiles being fired (left)\n\n- The Killer Wail 5.1 that can go through walls and target opponents.[1]\n\n- The Crab Tank special weapon\n\n- An Inkling inside a Big Bubbler.\n\n- New design of the .96 Gal.\n\n- Inklings and Octolings\n\n- Sloshing Machine with a slightly updated design.\n\n- Sloshing Machine\n\n- Flying spawner.\n\n- Flying spawners\n\n- Inklings and Octolings being ejected from the flying spawners.\n\n- Squids and octopuses\n\n- Squid performing a \"squid roll\".\n\n- Squid performing a \"squid surge\", with a Gold Dynamo Roller player behind them.\n\n- Gold Dynamo Roller\n\n- The Tri-Stringer\n\n- The Tri-Stringer being fired.\n\n- An updated Scorch Gorge from the Triple Inkstrike promotional video.

This area looks very similar to Scorch Gorge.\n\n- A doodle of this stage's map can be found on the top-right structure in the lobby's test range with Inkling words with arrows written around it.\n\n- During recon on Scorch Gorge, red-tailed hawk calls can be heard in the background.\n\n- Scorch Gorge is the only map to feature a fully custom Tricolor Turf War layout that completely revamped the stage. All other Tricolor Turf War stages are either altered existing stages that resembled existing layouts, or (in the case of Grand Splatlands Bowl) entirely new.\n\n- Scorch Gorge's Tricolor Turf War layout displays the Triforce incorrectly, with Power being on top, Courage being on the left, and Wisdom being on the right.\nIf Courage and Wisdom were switched, it would be shown correctly.\n\n- If Courage and Wisdom were switched, it would be shown correctly.\n\n- Despite this, the map marks the Super Jump landing spot for returning to spawn as this area.\n\n- If Courage and Wisdom were switched, it would be shown correctly."
