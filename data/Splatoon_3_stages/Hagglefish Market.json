Uninkable tents are located on the right of the spawn area. The first drop is an open area that also goes to the right, underneath the tents. The open area is accessible to the other team by ramps. Another tent is more forward to the open area. To the left of the open area is a raised area that goes to the left of the ramps. The center is slightly more raised than the lower area and has large uninkable boxes surrounding it. To the left and right of the center are wide paths that allow more flanks and additional access to the middle.\n\nIn Ranked Battles, specifications for the terrain or placement of objects are different between the modes; these changes create new paths or new objects to take cover behind.\n\nThe Splat Zone takes up a majority of the middle, in between the two raised uninkable towers. A block is added to the right-side route to allow easier access to the higher ground and blocks on the right side of spawn have been removed. Other than that, the stage is similar to the Turf War layout.\n\nThe Tower starts in the middle of the stage, replacing the block that is usually there. The tower strays towards the right for almost the entirety of its route until it goes up the ramps leading towards the first drop-down from spawn. After it goes up these ramps, it is only a short distance until it reaches the goal. The left side route now ramps up to be even to the middle section.\n\nThe Rainmaker starts on top of the block in the middle of the stage. The checkpoints are located just before entering the ramps to the opponent's spawn, or on the left of the tent near the middle. The left area is now accessible to the other team and blocks have been adjusted. The goal is located near the middle of the opponent's base.\n\nThe Clam Basket is located towards the left of the first drop-down from the player's team's spawn. The stage is similar to the Rainmaker layout, but the tents closest to the middle now have a climbable wall. An ink rail is added in the middle of the user's base to allow easier access to the tent.\n\nHagglefish Market was released with the launch of Splatoon 3.\n\nHagglefish Market was available in the following Splatfests as a Tricolor Turf War stage in Splatoon 3:\n\n- Palace vs. Theme Park vs. Beach\n\n- Past vs. Present vs. Future\n\n- — Fixed an issue where the position of the box placed on the metal grate near the starting point was displaced from the grate.\n\n- — In Tower Control mode, slightly adjusted the route of the tower and fixed an issue where the player would become unable to move on top of the small gap between the tower and terrain.\n\n- — Fixed an issue when playing Rainmaker mode that caused the score to not change smoothly in certain areas.\n\n- — Changed the terrain for some modes and reduced the impact of weapons shooting from far away.\nTurf War\nSplat Zones\nClam Blitz\n\n- Turf War\n\n- Splat Zones\n\n- Clam Blitz\n\n- Turf War\n\n- Splat Zones\n\n- Clam Blitz\n\n- — Added buildings corresponding to Crableg Capital in the background.\n\n- — Slightly changed terrain in all modes.\n\n- Turf War\n\n- Splat Zones\n\n- Tower Control\n\n- Rainmaker\n\n- Clam Blitz\n\n- Turf War\n\n- Splat Zones\n\n- Clam Blitz\n\n- Turf War\n\n- Splat Zones\n\n- Tower Control\n\n- Rainmaker\n\n- Clam Blitz\n\n- A slightly less cropped version of the stage icon.\n\n- An overview shot of Hagglefish Market.\n\n- Overhead view of the stage's Tricolor Turf War layout.\n\n- The Splat Zone in the center of Hagglefish Market.\n\n- The background in the direction of Crableg Capital before version 5.0.0.\n\n- The background in the direction of Crableg Capital after version 5.0.0.\n\n- Hagglefish Market seen from Crableg Capital.\n\n- Hagglefish Market during a Splatfest.\n\n- There are several stacks of cardboard boxes on the stage. When hit by players, they scatter and fade after a couple seconds.\n\n- During one of Deep Cut's Anarchy Splatcast discussions about the stage, one of the vendors there buys the treasure that the trio finds at The Crater.\n\n- This stage can be seen from Crableg Capital.\nAdditionally, in version 5.0.0, Hagglefish Market was updated to show Crableg Capital in the background.\n\n- Additionally, in version 5.0.0, Hagglefish Market was updated to show Crableg Capital in the background.\n\n- Additionally, in version 5.0.0, Hagglefish Market was updated to show Crableg Capital in the background.\n\nHagglefish Market is a pun on the fish species Hagfish, and \"haggle\", which means to negotiate or bargain."
