    "Shipshape Cargo Co. is a multiplayer stage in Splatoon 3. It is set on a semi-submersible cargo ship.",
    "The spawn platform of Shipshape Cargo Co. is a wide platform that has an inkrail on the far left and leads to high ground in the far right. There is a large pit in front of it, with the exit being underneath arches and lead to the middle of the stage. The left has a ramp and wall that leads to the left side of the arch and the right features a ramp that leads to the right side of this arch and a raised island over the right pit. Dropping from the right is a large pit with a sponge to retreat with. In this large pit, there are many inkable walls that lead to the center arch, grates that also lead to the center arch, and a ramp on the left that lead to the center of the stage. The area around the center of the stage is mostly flat with some boxes as cover. The center of the stage is slightly lower with a Bumper in the center and underneath the center arch. This arch can be jumped across from either side and can be accessed on the right side with a ramp or by climbing some inkable walls.",
    "In Ranked Battles, specifications for the terrain or placement of objects are different between the modes; these changes create new paths or new objects to take cover behind.",
    "The Splat Zone is located underneath the raised area in the middle of the stage. The area near the center has been flattened and the entrance to the opponent's spawn is changed, removing the right side of the spawn arch and making it a simpler platform. The entrance to the opponent's side was made more narrow as a result.",
    "The Tower starts in the middle of the stage. The middle has been changed, having the raised areas be climbable and raising the pit making it slightly higher than the ground around it. The Tower moves to the left onto the raised area, then down towards the middle, and then to the right near the raised area on the right. It then goes through the trench to the goal. The areas on the right have had parts of turf removed and the island on the right is now accessible from the middle with a grate. The raised areas on the left are also connected through grates from each team's open area near the middle.",
    "The Rainmaker starts in the center of the stage. The checkpoint is located before the trench to the opponent's spawn and on the raised area to the left. The goal is located after the trench in the open area. The layout is similar to Tower Control but another grate has been added to the island allowing access from below and the ramp near each team's spawn is changed slightly. The center also now has a ramp instead of a block to get up to.",
    "The Clam Basket is located on the raised area on the left from the middle of the stage. The stage is most similar to the Tower Control layout except for some inkable blocks added allowing another way to the basket and the grates on the left no longer being connected to the middle.",
    "Shipshape Cargo Co. debuted in Splatoon 3 as part of the Drizzle Season 2023.",
