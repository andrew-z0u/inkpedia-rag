There is a large pit in front of it, with the exit being underneath arches and lead to the middle of the stage. The left has a ramp and wall that leads to the left side of the arch and the right features a ramp that leads to the right side of this arch and a raised island over the right pit. Dropping from the right is a large pit with a sponge to retreat with. In this large pit, there are many inkable walls that lead to the center arch, grates that also lead to the center arch, and a ramp on the left that lead to the center of the stage. The area around the center of the stage is mostly flat with some boxes as cover. The center of the stage is slightly lower with a Bumper in the center and underneath the center arch. This arch can be jumped across from either side and can be accessed on the right side with a ramp or by climbing some inkable walls.\n\nIn Ranked Battles, specifications for the terrain or placement of objects are different between the modes; these changes create new paths or new objects to take cover behind.\n\nThe Splat Zone is located underneath the raised area in the middle of the stage. The area near the center has been flattened and the entrance to the opponent's spawn is changed, removing the right side of the spawn arch and making it a simpler platform. The entrance to the opponent's side was made more narrow as a result.\n\nThe Tower starts in the middle of the stage. The middle has been changed, having the raised areas be climbable and raising the pit making it slightly higher than the ground around it. The Tower moves to the left onto the raised area, then down towards the middle, and then to the right near the raised area on the right. It then goes through the trench to the goal. The areas on the right have had parts of turf removed and the island on the right is now accessible from the middle with a grate. The raised areas on the left are also connected through grates from each team's open area near the middle.\n\nThe Rainmaker starts in the center of the stage. The checkpoint is located before the trench to the opponent's spawn and on the raised area to the left. The goal is located after the trench in the open area. The layout is similar to Tower Control but another grate has been added to the island allowing access from below and the ramp near each team's spawn is changed slightly. The center also now has a ramp instead of a block to get up to.\n\nThe Clam Basket is located on the raised area on the left from the middle of the stage. The stage is most similar to the Tower Control layout except for some inkable blocks added allowing another way to the basket and the grates on the left no longer being connected to the middle.\n\nShipshape Cargo Co. debuted in Splatoon 3 as part of the Drizzle Season 2023.\n\n- — Fixed an issue that sometimes caused players to be submerged in water when landing on certain spots on the stage.\n\n- — Fixed an issue where a player's Tenta Brella would sometimes vanish immediately when launched.\n\n- — Fixed an issue in Rainmaker mode where there were places where the countdown would not get faster, even inside areas that the Rainmaker is not allowed to enter.\n\n- — Fixed an issue in Rainmaker mode where there were places where the countdown would not get faster when a player returned the Rainmaker to their own base.\n\n- — Fixed an issue in where dropping down while Dodge Rolling at certain locations would cause players to sink into the floor.\n\n- — Fixed an issue where the Zipcaster could be used to get inside terrain from beneath certain obstacles.\n\n- Turf War\n\n- Splat Zones\n\n- Tower Control\n\n- Rainmaker\n\n- Clam Blitz\n\n- Reveal of the stage.\n\n- Jellyfish operating machinery.\n\n- An aurora can be seen during a Splatfest.\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_hub_ad_Shipshape_Cargo_Co.mp4\n\n\nAn in-game advertisement for Shipshape Cargo Co.
