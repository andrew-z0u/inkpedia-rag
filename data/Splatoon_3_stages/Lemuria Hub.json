  "content": "Lemuria Hub is a multiplayer stage in Splatoon 3, which was added to the game as a part of Sizzle Season 2024 on 1 June 2024. It takes place in a train station. Unlike most stages, it features lateral symmetry.\n\n- 1 Anarchy Battle terrain\n\n1.1 Splat Zones\n1.2 Tower Control\n1.3 Rainmaker\n1.4 Clam Blitz\n\n- 1.1 Splat Zones\n\n- 1.2 Tower Control\n\n- 1.3 Rainmaker\n\n- 1.4 Clam Blitz\n\n- 2 Splatoon 3\n\n2.1 Maps\n2.2 Gallery\n\n- 2.1 Maps\n\n- 2.2 Gallery\n\n- 3 Quotes\n\n- 4 Trivia\n\n- 5 Etymology\n\n5.1 Names in other languages\n5.2 Translation notes\n\n- 5.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 5.2 Translation notes\n\n- 1.1 Splat Zones\n\n- 1.2 Tower Control\n\n- 1.3 Rainmaker\n\n- 1.4 Clam Blitz\n\n- 2.1 Maps\n\n- 2.2 Gallery\n\n- 5.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 5.2 Translation notes\n\nIn Anarchy Battles, specifications for the terrain or placement of objects are different between the modes; these changes create new paths or new objects to take cover behind.\n\nThere are two Splat Zones, located on the low ground next to the area under the bridge. The long ramp and moving platform leading to each team's side were removed and changed to high ground, preventing access to the opponents. The uninkable walls near the center moving platforms were removed.\n\nThe Tower starts at the very top of the stage, unaffected from the moving platform. The Tower then goes down to the low ground and then moves up to the goal, staying on the side of the moving platform. The stage is most similar to the Turf War layout with the only main change being the high ground at the top of the stage has been lowered and has an inkable wall added to it. The moving platform on the bridge also does not go to the very top, stopping just before the Tower starting position.\n\nThe Rainmaker starts at the same location as the Tower. The checkpoints are located on the middle of the low ground or just to the side of where the two middle moving platforms meet. The layout is most similar to the Splat Zones layout but the ramp and moving platform leading to the opponent's spawn is now present. The goal is located at the top of this ramp. An inkrail was added next to the ramp that leads up to the center bridge.\n\nThe Clam Basket is located on the side furthest from the center, next to the ramp and moving platform. The high ground next to it was shortened slightly and obstacles have been changed slightly. Other than that, the layout is similar to the Rainmaker layout.\n\n- Turf War\n\n- Splat Zones\n\n- Tower Control\n\n- Rainmaker\n\n- Clam Blitz\n\n- Lemuria Hub in the Sizzle Season 2024 trailer\n\n- A promotional image showing a booth within the play area of the stage.\n\n- A promotional image showing the station platforms in the background.\n\n- A waiting area featuring advertisements for Arowana Mall and Skipper Pavilion.\n\n- Jellyfish on the platforms waiting for the trains.\n\n- The toppled tower in The Crater, as seen from this stage.\n\n- Two characters, including the LH-TNTV character on the ground\n\n- Advertisements for Scorch Gorge seen in the sky during a Splatfest.\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Lemuria_Hub_promotional_video.mp4\n\n\nVideo showing the stage (link to file)\n\n- The design of the stage is based on the real-life Kyoto Station.\n\n- The overturned tower from the Crater and the tall skyscraper in the middle of Splatsville can be seen from this stage.\n\n- This is the third stage with lateral symmetry if Shifty Stations and Tricolor Turf War layouts are not included (after Saltspray Rig and Skipper Pavilion), and the sixth if they are (after Zappy Longshocking, Bridge to Tentaswitchia, and Scorch Gorge's Tricolor Turf War layout.).\n\n- Some of the advertisements on this stage reference Kelp Dome, Goby Arena, Shellendorf Institute, Museum d'Alfonsino, Arowana Mall, Skipper Pavilion, Camp Triggerfish, and Brinewater Springs.\nDuring a Splatfest, some of these advertisements will be projected in the sky on the right side of the map.\n\n- During a Splatfest, some of these advertisements will be projected in the sky on the right side of the map.\n\n- Some of the Deepsea Metro lines can be seen on a subway map.\n\n- There are posters that reference the musical productions The Lion King, Wicked, and Phantom of the Opera.\n\n- Several of the trains running in the background bear resemblance to various real-world rolling stock:\nThe green train that runs on the nearest platform beside the Alpha team spawn is based on the real-life Japan Railway 201 series.\nThe next platform further features a train resembling the 207 series operated by JR West.\nThe furthest platform in the background features a train resembling the N700 series Shinkansen.\nThe trains in the subway platforms below the stage resemble the rolling stock used in the Washington Metro.\n\n- The green train that runs on the nearest platform beside the Alpha team spawn is based on the real-life Japan Railway 201 series.\n\n- The next platform further features a train resembling the 207 series operated by JR West.\n\n- The furthest platform in the background features a train resembling the N700 series Shinkansen.\n\n- The trains in the subway platforms below the stage resemble the rolling stock used in the Washington Metro.\n\n- During a Splatfest, some of these advertisements will be projected in the sky on the right side of the map.\n\n- The green train that runs on the nearest platform beside the Alpha team spawn is based on the real-life Japan Railway 201 series.\n\n- The next platform further features a train resembling the 207 series operated by JR West.\n\n- The furthest platform in the background features a train resembling the N700 series Shinkansen.\n\n- The trains in the subway platforms below the stage resemble the rolling stock used in the Washington Metro.\n\nLemuria is a hypothesized lost continent that has supposedly sunk into the Indian Ocean.
