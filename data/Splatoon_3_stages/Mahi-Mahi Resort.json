It features a plethora of grates and inkable surfaces of various elevations and is surrounded by water. Mahi-Mahi Resort is unique in the fact that when a round is halfway over, the water level recedes and a large section of the stage that was previously inaccessible is uncovered by the receding water. Some platforms also rise during this time. All of the floating platforms in Mahi-Mahi Resort can be found here in the center. They get lower in elevation as the water recedes. There are three high platforms in the center, providing higher points to attack from, and can be used as an easy way to quickly reach the enemy team's base at the beginning of a match. Two towers become visible once the water level lowers, providing a little more cover from attacks and a place to attack from. Side platforms can be found close to the center, surrounded by water. When the water recedes, two platforms rise, creating more vantage points and area to cover.\n\nIn Ranked Battles, specifications for the terrain or placement of objects are different between the modes; these changes create new paths or new objects to take cover behind.\n\nIn Splat Zones, the block in the center has been removed and a platform covers the moat and acts as the Splat Zone. Once a team's meter reaches sixty points, the water level drops, revealing the many platforms under the water's surface, creating some cover and more area to move about. A few walls have been added to provide cover and space to move and attack.\n\nIn Splatoon 3 the Splat Zone is located in the center of the map, taking most of the center. The center raised area in the middle is removed and the other raised areas now have an inkable wall to get up to. Some barriers near the center have been removed. The water level drops when the team's meter reaches 60.\n\nThe Tower in Mahi-Mahi Resort starts in the center of the stage, on top of a block that can only be climbed on two sides. When activated, it goes to the enemy's base around floating platforms and higher ground. The water level automatically drops at the beginning of each game.\n\nIn Splatoon 3, the Tower starts in the center, going left then straight to the opponents' raised area. It then goes right then straight to the goal. The three raised areas in the middle are removed and the ground underneath the Tower path is removed and filled with water. The water level drops once a team has passed the second checkpoint. The ground underneath the tower path is filled after the water level drops.\n\nThe Rainmaker in Mahi-Mahi Resort starts in the center of the stage, on top of a large crate. Each goal is located in their respective team's base, on the level immediately below. A few floating platforms have been added and some boxes have been placed to aid the player carrying the Rainmaker to proceed to the goal. A row of balloons has also been extended to block Rainmaker shots. Once the Rainmaker's meter reaches forty points, the water level drops, revealing more platforms, walls and a ramp to make traveling into the enemy's base easier.\n\nIn Splatoon 3, the Rainmaker starts in the center of the stage. The center of the stage has changed drastically. Ramps have been added to the left of the Rainmaker starting position, allowing easier access to the opponents' raised area. Obstacles have been slightly changed and the raised islands at the center of the stage are removed entirely. The checkpoints are located in the opponents' raised area and the normal entrance to the opponents' base. The water level drops after clearing a checkpoint. The pedestal is located near the back of the opponents' base. The right side of the pedestal has been extended a bit and a block allowing access to one of the islands is replaced with a ramp.\n\nThe Clam baskets are located in the raised area of each team's side. The layout is similar to the Rainmaker layout. The water level drops when one team scores 40 points.\n\nMahi-Mahi Resort was announced on 12 November 2015, during a Nintendo Direct that also revealed Museum d'Alfonsino. It was released on 4 December 2015 at 02:00 UTC.[1]\n\n- Fixed the issue in Rainmaker Mode in which breaking the Rainmaker barrier while in the central area caused the special gauge to fill more than intended.\n\n- Turf War before water level drops.\n\n- Turf War after water level drops.\n\n- Splat Zones before water level drops.\n\n- Splat Zones after water level drops.\n\n- Tower Control before water level drops.\n\n- Tower Control after water level drops at the beginning.\n\n- Rainmaker before water level drops.\n\n- Rainmaker after water level drops.\n\n- Two Inklings battling from Mahi-Mahi Resort's platforms.\n\n- A few Inklings fighting from the low ground.\n\n- A close-range battle erupting in the center.\n\n- A bird's-eye view when Super Jumping.\n\n- Center of Mahi-Mahi Resort before the water level recedes.\n\n- After the water level recedes.\n\n- Mahi-Mahi Resort after the water level recedes.\n\n- A female Inkling stands on a platform.\n\n- Another Inkling stands with a Classic Squiffer in front of their spawn point.\n\n- An Inkling with an Inkbrush standing on one of the platforms.\n\n- A top-down view of Mahi-Mahi Resort, highlighting the pool's squid shape.\n\n- Recon for Rainmaker in Mahi-Mahi Resort.\n\n- Several jellyfish floating on inflatable rafts on Mahi-Mahi Resort.\n\n- Jellyfish by the poolside.\n\n- Jellyfish and a horseshoe crab.\n\n- Jellyfish applying sunscreen.\n\n- Jellyfish and a surrounding building.\n\n- A jellyfish wedding.\n\n- The Ammo Knights pattern on the walls behind the spawn points.\n\n- Stage equipment; its purpose is unknown.\n\n- The sky over Mahi-Mahi Resort.\n\nMahi-Mahi Resort was available in the following Splatfests in Splatoon:\n\n- Naughty vs. Nice\n\n- Red Kitsune Udon vs. Green Tanuki Soba (December 2015)\n\n- Get Fit vs. Get Rich\n\n- Show No Mercy! vs. Focus on Healing\n\n- Snowman vs. Sandcastle\n\n- Hoverboard vs. Jet Pack\n\n- World Tour vs. Space Adventure\n\n- Early Bird vs. Night Owl\n\nMahi-Mahi Resort was revealed to return in Splatoon 3 during the Splatoon 3 Direct shown on 10 August 2022. The stage was available at launch. It has a completely different layout than it had in Splatoon being made more narrow and smaller.\n\nMahi-Mahi Resort underwent a major renovation starting with version 5.1.0. The changes serve to make the stage larger and more open (though still not to the degree of its Splatoon counterpart), particularly when the water level drops.\n\nChanges include:\n\n- The immediate spawn area has been pushed backward, and the platform one level down from spawn has been extended to the right\n\n- An Inkrail now leads out of spawn.\n\n- The central area is significantly wider heightwise.\n\n- More ground is present when the water level drops.\n\n- Another \"island\" has been added, allowing entrance to the center of the stage.\n\n- Grates are now present in certain areas.\n\n- Tall, inkable columns have been added that allow access to the tops of the raised platforms from the central area.\n\n- Due to the stage's increase in size, the central platform now has grate platforms on either side to prevent it from becoming inaccessible.\n\nMahi-Mahi Resort was available in the following Splatfests as a Tricolor Turf War stage in Splatoon 3:\n\n- Baby Chicks vs. Li'l Bunnies vs. Bear Cubs\n\n- Past vs. Present vs. Future\n\nWhen Mahi-Mahi Resort is used as a Tricolor Turf War stage, the water level drops after the first Ultra Signal has been claimed.\n\n- — Fixed an issue in Tower Control mode where an area impassable to players would appear midair when the water level dropped.\n\n- — Fixed an issue in Rainmaker mode where in certain locations the score count would not change as intended.\n\n- — Fixed an issue when playing Splat Zones mode that prevented players from properly placing a Tacticooler in certain areas and prevented the player who tried to place it from being able to properly stand on the stage's terrain.\n\n- — Changed the terrain for some modes and reduced the impact of weapons shooting from far away.\nTurf War\nSplat Zones\n\n- Turf War\n\n- Splat Zones\n\n- Turf War\n\n- Splat Zones\n\n- — The terrain in Mahi-Mahi Resort has been changed in all modes.\n\n- Turf War\n\n- Splat Zones\n\n- Splat Zones after the water level drops\n\n- Tower Control\n\n- Tower Control after the water level drops\n\n- Rainmaker\n\n- Rainmaker after the water level drops\n\n- Clam Blitz\n\n- Clam Blitz after the water level drops\n\n- Turf War\n\n- Turf War after water level drops\n\n- Splat Zones\n\n- Splat Zones after water level drops\n\n- Turf War\n\n- Turf War after water level drops\n\n- Splat Zones\n\n- Splat Zones after water level drops\n\n- Tower Control\n\n- Tower Control after water level drops\n\n- Rainmaker\n\n- Rainmaker after water level drops\n\n- Clam Blitz\n\n- Clam Blitz after water level drops\n\n- Tricolor Turf War\n\n- Tricolor Turf War after water level drops\n\n- The Splat Dualies being used in Mahi Mahi Resort.\n\n- An Inkling using a Fizzy Bomb.\n\n- The jellyfish band in Mahi-Mahi Resort.\n\n- The band as seen in-game.\n\n- A jellyfish birthday party in the same spot as the wedding in Splatoon.\n\n- A Mellow Squid 4-Panel Comic featuring elongated versions of the Mahi-Mahi Resort performers.\n\n- Overhead view of the stage's Tricolor Turf War layout during Baby Chicks vs. Li'l Bunnies vs. Bear Cubs.\n\n- Overhead view of the stage's Tricolor Turf War layout after the water drops.\n\n- Mahi-Mahi Resort during a Splatfest in Splatoon 3.\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_hub_ad_Mahi-Mahi_Resort.mp4\n\n\nAn in-game advertisement for Mahi-Mahi Resort (link to file)\n\n- The Inkling text on one of the buildings loosely resembles the words \"MAHIMAHI RESORT & SPA\", its full name in Japanese.\n\n- The surrounding buildings are similar to those at Aulani, a Disney resort and spa.\n\n- In Splatoon, two jellyfishes getting married are visible at the edge of the stage.\nLater, in Splatoon 3, they are seen celebrating their child's birthday at the same spot.\n\n- Later, in Splatoon 3, they are seen celebrating their child's birthday at the same spot.\n\n- The changing water levels gimmick is also used for the Shifty Station variant Furler in the Ashes in Splatoon 2.
