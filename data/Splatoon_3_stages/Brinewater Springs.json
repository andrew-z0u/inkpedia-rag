    "Brinewater Springs is a multiplayer stage in Splatoon 3. It is one of the stages that can have Tricolor Turf Wars.",
    "Brinewater Springs takes place at an outdoor onsen located in an urban area with Japanese architecture, similar to Skipper Pavilion. The stage is located on uneven terrain and features pits of water.",
    "The spawn areas are raised areas that go far to the right. The entire way to the middle of the stage is a ramp that slopes down with few instances of flat land. Few barriers are located on the ramp. After dropping from the spawn region, it is possible to jump down into a lowered area, with a tree and an inkable wall for cover, that has two entrances to the middle. The middle is very open and has one block in the center as cover.",
    "Following Version 8.0.0, Brinewater Springs was revamped slightly. The low ground on the left was expanded with more ground and some boxes to act as cover and another way to enter the middle of the stage. The far right platform area was also expanded. Small uninkable boxes were also added throughout the stage.",
    "In Ranked Battles, specifications for the terrain or placement of objects are different between the modes; these changes create new paths or new objects to take cover behind.",
    "The Splat Zone is in the middle of the stage. The stage is unchanged from Turf War.",
    "The Tower starts in the middle of the stage, replacing the block normally there. Two small blocks are added around the Tower. The Tower goes left then forward into the opposing team's side. It then goes up the ramp all the way to the goal. The uninkable walls next to the signs were removed.",
    "Following version 8.0.0, the Tower path was modified slightly and the checkpoints were moved.",
    "The Rainmaker is located on the block in the middle. The checkpoint is found when just entering the opponent's side. The goal is located on the first drop from the opponent's spawn area. A ramp is added there for access. Small uninkable blocks are added near the block in the middle.",
    "Following version 8.0.0 the pedestal was moved to the right and the ramp was moved alongside it. The low ground next to the ramp was was raised and now features a ramp and grate for defending. A light pole was added on the center of the large ramp.",
    "The Clam Basket is located halfway up the ramp. The area below the basket is now flat instead of being a ramp. The tree on the flank area is removed and replaced with an inkrail, allowing easier access to the clam basket. The block in the middle of the stage is replaced with a Bumper.",
    "Following version 8.0.0, there is a new ramp and walls replacing the block in the center of the stage, taken directly from Tricolor Turf War.",
    "Brinewater Springs debuted in Splatoon 3 as part of the Chill Season 2022.",
    "Brinewater Springs was available in the following Splatfests as a Tricolor Turf War stage in Splatoon 3:",
    "\"Brinewater\" is partly derived from the Japanese name of the stage, as brine is prominently used in the preparation of its namesake fish dish kusaya.",
