It is one of the stages that can have Tricolor Turf Wars.\n\nBrinewater Springs takes place at an outdoor onsen located in an urban area with Japanese architecture, similar to Skipper Pavilion. The stage is located on uneven terrain and features pits of water.\n\n- 1 Layout\n\n- 2 Ranked Battle terrain\n\n2.1 Splat Zones\n2.2 Tower Control\n2.3 Rainmaker\n2.4 Clam Blitz\n\n- 2.1 Splat Zones\n\n- 2.2 Tower Control\n\n- 2.3 Rainmaker\n\n- 2.4 Clam Blitz\n\n- 3 Splatoon 3\n\n3.1 Splatfests\n3.2 Version history\n3.3 Maps\n\n3.3.1 After 8.0\n\n\n3.4 Gallery\n3.5 Videos\n\n- 3.1 Splatfests\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Maps\n\n3.3.1 After 8.0\n\n- 3.3.1 After 8.0\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.5 Videos\n\n- 4 Quotes\n\n- 5 Trivia\n\n- 6 Etymology\n\n6.1 Names in other languages\n6.2 Translation notes\n\n- 6.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 6.2 Translation notes\n\n- 7 References\n\n- 2.1 Splat Zones\n\n- 2.2 Tower Control\n\n- 2.3 Rainmaker\n\n- 2.4 Clam Blitz\n\n- 3.1 Splatfests\n\n- 3.2 Version history\n\n- 3.3 Maps\n\n3.3.1 After 8.0\n\n- 3.3.1 After 8.0\n\n- 3.4 Gallery\n\n- 3.5 Videos\n\n- 3.3.1 After 8.0\n\n- 6.1 Names in other languages\n\n- 6.2 Translation notes\n\nThe spawn areas are raised areas that go far to the right. The entire way to the middle of the stage is a ramp that slopes down with few instances of flat land. Few barriers are located on the ramp. After dropping from the spawn region, it is possible to jump down into a lowered area, with a tree and an inkable wall for cover, that has two entrances to the middle. The middle is very open and has one block in the center as cover.\n\nFollowing Version 8.0.0, Brinewater Springs was revamped slightly. The low ground on the left was expanded with more ground and some boxes to act as cover and another way to enter the middle of the stage. The far right platform area was also expanded. Small uninkable boxes were also added throughout the stage.\n\nIn Ranked Battles, specifications for the terrain or placement of objects are different between the modes; these changes create new paths or new objects to take cover behind.\n\nThe Splat Zone is in the middle of the stage. The stage is unchanged from Turf War.\n\nThe Tower starts in the middle of the stage, replacing the block normally there. Two small blocks are added around the Tower. The Tower goes left then forward into the opposing team's side. It then goes up the ramp all the way to the goal. The uninkable walls next to the signs were removed.\n\nFollowing version 8.0.0, the Tower path was modified slightly and the checkpoints were moved.\n\nThe Rainmaker is located on the block in the middle. The checkpoint is found when just entering the opponent's side. The goal is located on the first drop from the opponent's spawn area. A ramp is added there for access. Small uninkable blocks are added near the block in the middle.\n\nFollowing version 8.0.0 the pedestal was moved to the right and the ramp was moved alongside it. The low ground next to the ramp was was raised and now features a ramp and grate for defending. A light pole was added on the center of the large ramp.\n\nThe Clam Basket is located halfway up the ramp. The area below the basket is now flat instead of being a ramp. The tree on the flank area is removed and replaced with an inkrail, allowing easier access to the clam basket. The block in the middle of the stage is replaced with a Bumper.\n\nFollowing version 8.0.0, there is a new ramp and walls replacing the block in the center of the stage, taken directly from Tricolor Turf War.\n\nBrinewater Springs debuted in Splatoon 3 as part of the Chill Season 2022.\n\nBrinewater Springs was available in the following Splatfests as a Tricolor Turf War stage in Splatoon 3:\n\n- Zombie vs. Skeleton vs. Ghost\n\n- Past vs. Present vs. Future\n\n- — Fixed an issue that caused trees in front of the player to not display as transparent.\n\n- — Fixed an issue when playing Splat Zones/Tower Control/Rainmaker/Clam Blitz modes that caused the score to not change smoothly in certain areas and \"DON'T RETREAT!\" to be displayed even if you weren't retreating very much.\n\n- — Fixed an issue that caused ink fired from up high to disappear before hitting the ground.\n\n- — Fixed an issue where players could get onto rocks outside the stage.\n\n- — Changed terrain in all modes.\n\n- Turf War\n\n- Splat Zones\n\n- Tower Control\n\n- Rainmaker\n\n- Clam Blitz\n\n- Tricolor Turf War\n\n- Turf War\n\n- Splat Zones\n\n- Tower Control\n\n- Rainmaker\n\n- Clam Blitz\n\n- The tree in the lower section.\n\n- Jellyfish relaxing in the water.\n\n- Jellyfish relaxing in the water and Jellyfish walking around.\n\n- Jellyfish in a sauna.\n\n- A noticeboard near the spawn area, displaying a map of the surrounding area.\n\n- The village close to the stage across the river\n\n- The hotel near the stage\n\n- Overhead view of the stage's Tricolor Turf War layout.\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_Brinewater_Springs_promotional_video.mp4\n\n\nPromotional Video (link to file)\n\n- Load videoLocal FileLocal File might collect personal data.ContinueDismisshttps://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/File:S3_hub_ad_Brinewater_Springs.mp4\n\n\nAn in-game advertisement for Brinewater Springs (link to file)\n\n- This is the only multiplayer battle stage in Splatoon 3 to be set at sunset rather than midday.\n\n- Brinewater Springs is said to let anyone use their services for free during a Splatfest; however, Frye suggests that most have been unable to take advantage of this, due to jellyfish booking every nearby inn solid. [3]\n\n\"Brinewater\" is partly derived from the Japanese name of the stage, as brine is prominently used in the preparation of its namesake fish dish kusaya."
